This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT

The CBCT projection data of a phantom were acquired during rotational megavoltage (MV) dose delivery up to 6 Gy to evaluate image quality under MV beam irradiation. A lung tumor patient was treated with a total dose of 48 Gy in four fractions, each fraction including seven coplanar and noncoplanar beams, as well as a full-angle rotational beam. Tumor registration was performed between a planning CT image and a CBCT image immediately after patient setup. The patient couch was adjusted according to the registration results, and then the registration was repeated three times: immediately before treatment, during treatment, and immediately after treatment. The phantom image quality of the kV CBCT was not visually degraded up to the rotational MV dose of 6 Gy. Tumor position during rotational dose delivery was verified for the first time using kV CBCT

Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

The initial 30 patients were treated with proton beams; the subsequent 810 patients were treated with helium ion beams. In the great majority of the 475 patients treated for pituitary tumors, marked and sustained biochemical and clinical improvement was observed. Variable degrees of hypopituitarism developed in about one-third of patients treated solely with radiosurgery. In the earlier years of the program, 365 patients underwent radiosurgery to treat selected systemic diseases by inducing hypopituitarism. Focal temporal lobe necrosis and cranial nerve injury occurred in about 1% of patients who were treated with doses less than 230 Gy

The most favorable clinical results by fast neutron treatment had been revealed in such diseases as follows; salivary gland tumors, prostate cancer, Pancoast type lung cancer, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma. The characteristics of these tumors as to the radiobiological properties and the dose distribution are, 1) relatively slow growing tumors and higher RBE for tumor tissue, and 2) capability of correct delivery of a big radiation doses to the target, without any severe radiation complications. Normal tissue tolerance (NSD formulas) for each tissues were also discussed

It included irradiation of the bed of tumor removed. Fast electron beam was produced by a small betatron (collimator size--5 x 6 cm and 8 x 12 cm) installed in the operating room. Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1991, 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (stages IIB-IVA) were treated with a curative intent by external photon irradiation to the pelvis, followed by proton irradiation to the primary tumor, delivering a median total tumor dose of 86 Gy (range 71 Gy/26 Fr-101 Gy/46 Fr), and were followed for a median period of 139 months (range 11-184 months). RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 89% and 40%, respectively. Five-year local control rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 100% and 61%, respectively. Four percent of patients experienced severe (Grade 4 or more) late complications in the intestine or urinary bladder at 5 years. CONCLUSION: External photon and proton therapy is effective for those who are not eligible for intracavitary irradiation, and who otherwise have a poor prognosis. The results show that tumor control, survival, and morbidity are similar to those after conventional therapy

One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

METHODS: Twenty patients with multiple brain metastases not having received any previous brain radiation were selected for the study. The total radiation dose varied from 40 (20 fractions) to 50 (25 fractions) Gy, with an opposition technique. MRS was performed just before irradiation, during the acute phase (n = 20, 8.5 +/- 4.6 days) and in the early delayed phase (n = 15, 3.6 +/- 0.5 months) after radiation. The concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), choline-containing substance (Cho), and creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) was quantified. RESULTS: The concentration of NAA decreased (P = 0.05 versus before radiation), and the concentration of Cho increased (P = 0.006 versus before radiation) during the early delayed phase. The concentration of Cr was not changed before or after radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced changes in brain metabolism were well detected with quantitative MRS in the early delayed phase. Quantitative MRS is a novel tool for estimating radiation-induced neurotoxicity

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. METHODS: Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. RESULTS: The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

[Review] [58 refs]	Brachytherapy, Child, Dose Fractionation, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], France, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Research	There have been considerable technical improvements in radiation therapy for the past two decades. In children affected with cancer, these have been likely overshadowed by concommittant major chemotherapy-based advances, and at least in part ignored and misused. This article outlines principles, technological requirements, and clinical applications of innovations that aim at improving ballistical selectivity (such as conformal, intensity modulation, stereotactic photons, charged particles, and intraoperative therapies), as well as at influencing tumors and normal tissues sensitivity to radiations (such as high LET particles, and altered fractionations).

Although this tumor is radio-resistant and located in a very radiosensitive organ, a conservative approach using radiotherapy is feasible for small or medium size melanomas. The physical and radiobiological basis of the techniques presently used, brachytherapy and protontherapy, are presented together with the complications inherent to each treatment. Future prospects discussed concern the association of hyperthermia with conventional irradiation and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT).

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1066-1070	
1	282	Is proton beam therapy cost effective in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate?[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/ec [Economics], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Male, Markov Chains, Middle Aged, Photons, Probability, Prostatic Neoplasms/ec [Economics], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Research	PURPOSE: New treatments are introduced routinely into clinical practice without rigorous economic analysis. The specific aim of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of proton beam radiation compared with current state-of-the art therapy in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Materials and METHODS: A Markov model was informed with cost, freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), and utility data obtained from the literature and from patient interviews to compare the cost effectiveness of 91.8 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) delivered with proton beam versus 81 CGE delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The length of how many years the model was run, patient's age, probability of FFBF after treatment with proton beam therapy and IMRT, utility of patients treated with salvage hormone therapy, and treatment cost were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Analysis at 15 years resulted in an expected mean cost of proton beam therapy and IMRT of $63,511 and $36,808, and $64,989 and $39,355 for a 70-year-old and 60-year-old man respectively, with quality-adjusted survival of 8.54 and 8.12 and 9.91 and 9.45 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to be $63,578/QALY for a 70-year-old man and $55,726/QALY for a 60-year-old man. CONCLUSION: Even when based on the unproven assumption that protons will permit a 10-Gy escalation of prostate dose compared with IMRT photons, proton beam therapy is not cost effective for most patients with prostate cancer using the commonly accepted standard of $50,000/QALY. Consideration should be given to limiting the number of proton facilities to allow comprehensive evaluation of this modality

An electron beam with the energy of 7 MeV was produced on the small-size betatron, irradiation fields were formed, and absorbed dose distribution was studied. The efficacy of the use of the beam in 110 patients with superficial malignant tumors was analyzed. The use of electron beam radiation was found promising for therapy of patients with locally spread types of skin and lower lip cancers and breast cancer local recurrences. Complete tumor regression was noted in 75-90% of the patients. Intraoral cone electron therapy combined with 60Co-therapy of surgery was employed for early cancer of the oral cavity

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated in Uppsala during 1991-97 were included (men = 14, women = 12; mean age = 39, range = 23-64). The nidus volumes ranged from 0.3 to 102 ml (mean = 24, median = 13). The follow-up included clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (and/or computed tomography) every 6-12 months for 3 years and final angiography. RESULTS: The volume changes at final follow-up in AVMs >25 ml were -89, -85, -44, -29, -7, 0, 0, +5 and +18 (%); in AVMs 11-24 ml, -100, -100, -97, -92 and 0 (%); and in AVMs <10 ml, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, -99, -98, -50, -0 and +40 (%). Two patients were lost to follow-up due to cerebral haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. Radiology displayed significant perifocal oedema in one patient and slight oedema in four patients. Of nine patients with epilepsy, seven became seizure-free after therapy while two continued to suffer from seizures. CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation is successful in a relatively high proportion of intermediate and large-sized cerebral AVMs. The adverse effects are acceptable. The advantage of proton treatment compared with gamma knife and LINAC stereotactic irradiation is that protons can irradiate even large volumes with a very sharp dose profile against normal surroundings. Thus, proton beam irradiation is a valuable option in the treatment of AVMs larger than 10 ml	
0	3935	A precision cranial immobilization system for conformal stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy	Boston, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Equipment Design, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Massachusetts, Methods, Motion, Movement, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Rotation, Stereotaxic Techniques	PURPOSE: Conformal radiotherapy has been shown to benefit from precision alignment of patient target to therapy beam (1, 6, 13). This work describes an optimized immobilization system for the fractionated treatment of intracranial targets. A study of patient motion demonstrates the high degree of immobilization which is available. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system using dental fixation and a thermoplastic mask that relocates on a rigid frame is described. The design permits scanning studies using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR), conventional photon radiotherapy, and high precision stereotactic proton radiotherapy to be performed with minimal repositioning variation. Studies of both intratreatment motion and daily setup reliability are performed on patients under treatment for paranasal sinus carcinoma. Multiple radiographs taken during single treatments provide the basis for a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis. Additionally, studies of orthogonal radiographs used to setup for proton treatments and verification port films from photon treatments are used to establish day to day patient position variation in routine use. RESULTS: Net 3D patient motion during any treatment is measured to be 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] and rotation about any body axis is 0.14 +/- 0.67 degrees (mean +/- SD). Day-to-day setup accuracy to laser marks is limited to 2.3 mm (mean) systematic error and 1.6 mm (mean) random error. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the most stringent immobilization requirements of 3D conformal radiotherapy adjacent to critical normal structures can be met with a high precision system such as the one described here. Without the use of pretreatment verification, additional developments in machine and couch design are needed to assure that patient repositioning accuracy is comparable to the best level of patient immobility achievable	
0	1964	A system for three-dimensional dosimetric verification of treatment plans in intensity-modulated radiotherapy with heavy ions	Arm, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Computer Simulation, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Reproducibility of Results, Water	The introduction of dynamic intensity modulation into radiotherapy using conventional photon beams or scanning particle beams requires additional and efficient methods of dose verification. Dose measurements in dynamically generated dose distributions with a single ionization chamber require a complete application of the treatment field for each single measurement. Therefore measurements are performed by simultaneous use of multiple ionization chambers. The measurement is performed by a computer controlled system and is comprised of the following steps: (a) automated positioning of the ionization chambers, (b) measurement at these points, (c) a comparison with the calculated dose from the treatment planning system, and (d) documentation of the measurement. The ionization chambers are read out by a multichannel electrometer and are densely packed into a mounting of polymethylmetacrylate, which is attached to the arm of a three-dimensional motor-driven water phantom. The measured and planned dose values are displayed numerically as well as graphically. The mean deviation between measured and planned doses as well as their standard deviation are calculated and displayed. Through printouts complete documentation of the measurement is obtained and a quick decision can be made whether the dose distribution is acceptable for the patient. The system is now routinely used for dose verification at the heavy ion therapy project at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. Up to now 242 measurements have been performed for heavy ion treatment of 30 patients. The system allows efficient verification and documentation of carbon ion fields and is in principle also applicable to intensity-modulated photon beams

Of 562 eyes treated over a 10-year period with pretreatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better, 363 (64.6%) contained tumors within 2 disc diameters (DD) of the disc or fovea. Rates of visual loss after treatment to worse than 20/200 and causes of visual decline were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cumulative rates of visual loss among subjects with tumors near the disc or fovea were 33 and 47% 1 and 2 years after treatment compared to 17 and 28%, respectively, for subjects with tumors located farther from both structures. The leading cause of visual loss in the first year among eyes with tumors near the disc or fovea was retinal detachment. Controlling for other predictors of visual loss to worse than 20/200, location near the disc or fovea was independently related to visual loss primarily due to retinal detachment, cataract, and radiation retinopathy. Despite the unfavorable location of these tumors, over half of patients with 20/200 or better pretreatment visual acuity had useful vision 2 years after treatment	
0	653	IMRT with compensators for head-and-neck cancers treatment technique, dosimetric accuracy, and practical experiences.[erratum appears in Strahlenther Onkol. 2005 Dec;181(12):810]	Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Reproducibility of Results, Risk, Time, Tonsillar Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With three-dimensional conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy (3D-c-IMRT) a heterogeneous dose distribution can be achieved in both planning treatment volume and in adjacent normal tissues and organs to be spared. 3D-c-IMRT demands for modified photon fluence profiles which can be accomplished with different techniques. This report deals with the commissioning of metal compensators and the first experiences in clinical use. Dosimetric accuracy, dose coverage and practical experience like treatment delivery time, monitor units and dose outside the treated volume are evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to April 2004, 24 patients with head-and-neck cancers were treated with 3D-c-IMRT using tin-wax compensators. The dose prescription included a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB). High-dose volume was irradiated with 60-70 Gy (median 66 Gy), low-dose volume with 48-54 Gy (median 52 Gy) administered by a standardized seven- portal coplanar beam arrangement. Dose at one parotid gland was aimed at 26 Gy. The compensators used consisted of tin granules embedded in wax; recalculation was performed with compensators made of the alloy MCP96 as well. RESULTS: In 21 of 24 patients 3D-c-IMRT with tin-wax compensators reduced the median dose to one parotid gland to < 30 Gy. Recalculation with compensators with higher density which allowed higher attenuation revealed better protection of the parotid gland. The treatment delivery time per fraction was between 6 and 12 min (plus time for patient positioning), approximately 300 MU per 2 Gy were applied. The dose outside the treated volume was increased with regard to open fields and comparable with a physical wedge of 15-30 degrees . Quality assurance and treatment of patient were fast and simple. It was shown, that calculated dose distribution corresponded to measured dose distribution with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: The described method offers facilities for a good dose coverage of irregular target volumes with different prescribed doses and a considerable dose reduction in adjacent organs at risk. The dose sparing of organs at risk can be further improved, if a compensator material with higher density is used	
0	885	Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children	California, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Count, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pilot Projects, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, base-of-skull sarcomas, low-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and para-nasal sinus tumors. In addition, we have treated bone sarcomas in the neck and trunk--mainly in the sacral area--as well as prostate cases and some soft tissue sarcomas. PTV volumes for our treated cases are in the range 20-4500 ml, indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating lesions of all types and sizes. The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of fluence modulated Bragg peaks delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 000. With the current delivery rate of roughly 3000 Bragg peaks per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to 20-25 min. Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about 10% of delivered spots have a weight of more than 10% of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for optimizing the number of spots delivered per field. Field specific dosimetry shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within +/-1 mm (1 SD) orthogonal to the field direction and to within 1.5 mm in range. With our current delivery system the mean widths of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 mm (sigma) for all energies, indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be made. In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg peaks shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg peaks over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of penetration. This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast re-scanning on second generation scanning gantries

Dosimetric factors are used for prediction of the occurrence of RP after XRT. Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CRT) is a promising modality because of its excellent dose localization and high biological effect on tumors. This study aims to analyze the relationship between dosimetric factors developed for XRT and the incidence of RP in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after CRT. We examined 80 inoperable patients with NSCLC. The ranges of the daily fraction sizes and the total doses were from 3.3 to 8.8 GyE and from 59.4 to 95.4 GyE, respectively. These doses were successfully delivered with acceptable toxicity; >or= grade 2 RP was observed in 8 patients (10%). The severity of RP was graded within 6 months of the initiation of CRT using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. These results indicate the excellent dose distribution of CRT. We then compared the dosimetric data of the 8 patients developed >or= grade 2 RP with those of 72 patients developed <or= grade 1 RP. Dosimetric factors useful for predicting RP in XRT, such as the percentage of the computed tomography-defined total lung volume receiving > 5, > 20, and > 30 GyE, and mean lung dose, were not predictive factors for RP after CRT. The dosimetric factors used for XRT are not applicable for CRT in patients with NSCLC. The dosimetric factors for CRT remain to be developed

In this study, quality assurance for FSRT of 58 cases, between August 1995 and August 1997 are described, and the errors for each step and overall accuracy were estimated. Some of the important items for FSRT procedures are: accuracy in CT localization, transferred image distortion, laser alignment, isocentric accuracy of linear accelerator, head frame movement, portal verification, and various human errors. A geometric phantom, that has known coordinates was used to estimate the accuracy of CT localization. A treatment planning computer was used for checking the transferred image distortion. The mechanical isocenter standard (MIS), rectilinear phantom pointer: (RLPP), and laser target localizer frame (LTLF) were used for laser alignment and target coordinates setting. Head-frame stability check was performed by a depth confirmation helmet (DCH). A film test was done to check isocentric accuracy and portal verification. All measured data for the 58 patients were recorded and analyzed for each item. 4-MV x-rays from a linear accelerator, were used for FSRT, along with homemade circular cones with diameters from 20 to 70 mm (interval: 5 mm). The accuracy in CT localization was 1.2+/-0.5 mm. The isocentric accuracy of the linear accelerator, including laser alignment, was 0.5+/-0.2 mm. The reproducibility of the head frame was 1.1+/-0.6 mm. The overall accuracy was 1.7+/-0.7 mm, excluding human errors

Fifty-two out of 249 patients accepted for pion treatment by the end of 1986 were treated for malignant glioma with high dose pion irradiation. A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated

Furthermore, we described how EPID dosimetry was used to solve a clinical problem. IMRT prostate plans were delivered to a homogeneous slab phantom. EPID transit images were acquired for each segment. A previously developed in-house back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom mid-plane (intersecting the isocenter). Segment dose images were summed to obtain an EPID mid-plane dose image for each field. Fields were compared using profiles and in two dimensions with the y evaluation (criteria: 3%/3 mm). To quantify results, the average gamma (gamma avg), maximum gamma (gamma max), and the percentage of points with gamma < 1(P gamma < 1) were calculated within the 20% isodose line of each field. For 10 patient plans, all fields were measured with EPID and film at gantry set to 0 degrees. The film was located in the phantom coronal mid-plane (10 cm depth), and compared with the back-projected EPID mid-plane absolute dose. EPID and film measurements agreed well for all 50 fields, with (gamma avg) =0.16, (gamma max)=1.00, and (P gamma < 1)= 100%. Based on these results, film measurements were discontinued for verification of prostate IMRT plans. For 20 patient plans, the dose distribution was re-calculated with the phantom CT scan and delivered to the phantom with the original gantry angles. The planned isocenter dose (plan(iso)) was verified with the EPID (EPID(iso)) and an ionization chamber (IC(iso)). The average ratio, (EPID(iso)/IC(iso)), was 1.00 (0.01 SD). Both measurements were systematically lower than planned, with (EPID(iso)/plan(iso)) and (IC(iso)/plan(iso))=0.99 (0.01 SD). EPID mid-plane dose images for each field were also compared with the corresponding plane derived from the three dimensional (3D) dose grid calculated with the phantom CT scan. Comparisons of 100 fields yielded (gamma avg)=0.39, gamma max=2.52, and (P gamma < 1)=98.7%. Seven plans revealed under-dosage in individual fields ranging from 5% to 16%, occurring at small regions of overlapping segments or along the junction of abutting segments (tongue-and-groove side). Test fields were designed to simulate errors and gave similar results. The agreement was improved after adjusting an incorrectly set tongue-and-groove width parameter in the treatment planning system (TPS), reducing (gamma max) from 2.19 to 0.80 for the test field. Mid-plane dose distributions determined with the EPID were consistent with film measurements in a slab phantom for all IMRT fields. Isocenter doses of the total plan measured with an EPID and an ionization chamber also agreed. The EPID can therefore replace these dosimetry devices for field-by-field and isocenter IMRT pre-treatment verification. Systematic errors were detected using EPID dosimetry, resulting in the adjustment of a TPS parameter and alteration of two clinical patient plans. One set of EPID measurements (i.e., one open and transit image acquired for each segment of the plan) is sufficient to check each IMRT plan field-by-field and at the isocenter, making it a useful, efficient, and accurate dosimetric tool

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation

Twenty-three eyes have been enucleated because of complications and five eyes have been obtained at autopsy. We have evaluated 27 of these eyes. Neovascular glaucoma (10 eyes), painful keratitis (6 eyes), continued tumor growth (4 eyes), and vitreous hemorrhage (2 eyes) were the major complications of treatment that led to enucleation. The degree of tumor necrosis correlated with the size, pigmentation, and anterior extent of the tumor. It did not correlate with the interval from irradiation or with the amount of tumor shrinkage. Mitotic figures were extremely rare in treated tumors, suggesting that the tumor cells have lost their ability to cycle

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

Focussed accelerated helium ion beams derived from charged-particle cyclotrons are stereotactically directed into the brain to obliterate abnormal shunts. Treated patients demonstrate delayed changes in brain anatomy and function that occur months to years after radiosurgery. The underlying mechanisms of the brain's delayed reaction to charged-particle radiosurgery involve complex perturbations in cerebrovascular and metabolic function. This report describes the wide range of delayed reactions that may occur in the brain after radiosurgery, including hemodynamic changes, blood-brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema, metabolic suppression, and parenchymal necrosis. These delayed reactions to injury in the brain involve potential target cells that include cerebral endothelial cells, oligodendroglia and astrocytes

Two different chemotherapy regimens were used for concurrent chemoradiation. In the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was infused intravenously, followed immediately by five consecutive daily administrations of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2/day, each infused intravenously over 24 hr. As for the patients with adenocarcinoma, 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 250 mg/m2 of cytoxan and 45 mg/m2 of adriamycin were administered intravenously on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 54.4% with stage III and IV, 62.6% with lymph node metastasis on computed tomogram or MRI, 77.9% with stage I-II disease with lesion size > or =4 cm, and 50.3% with small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Side effects from concurrent chemoradiation such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were present in all 395 cases. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were observed to varying degrees, but there was no toxic death. This study suggests that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation in treating cervical cancer patients with high risk factors is effective and relatively well tolerated, with acceptable toxicity

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 1997, 102 patients with multiple cancer metastases received half-body irradiation (HBI) at the Center of Oncology--Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute in Krakow. Most of the patients (93/102) had bone metastases (Table 1). The HBI was performed with 9 MV photon beam from linear accelerator. In 88 patients only one region (upper, mid or lower) was treated, and 14 patients received upper and lower HBI (13 patients), or upper and mid HBI (one patient) (Table 2). The mean doses were: 6 Gy in upper HBI, 8 Gy in mid HBI, and 9 Gy in lower HBI (Table 3). RESULTS: The positive palliative effect (complete or partial pain relief) was observed in 77 (75.5%) patients (Table 4). Complete pain relief was higher in patients with prostate cancer, and in patients who received mid or lower HBI. During follow-up 47 (46.1%) patients developed pain progression after treatment (Table 5). The probability of survival without pain progression was higher in patients who developed complete pain relief (86.7% at 6 months, 69.3% at 12 and 24 months) than in patients with partial response (52.9% at 6 months, 32.8% at 12 months, and 5.5% at 24 months) (Figure 1). In most of the patients (74/102, 72.5%) the tolerance was good. CONCLUSIONS: HBI is an efficient method for palliation in patients with multiple painful metastases

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

Hypophyseal tumors, tumors of the cavernous sinus, arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area, and arteriovenous malformations are irradiated at the N. N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR, AMS using the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Methods of "piercing" irradiation and methods with the use of Bragg's peak are being developed. At present over 200 patients with hormonally active hypophyseal tumors, 30 patients with tumors of the cavernous sinus, 23 patients with deep seated arteriovenous malformations, and 10 patients with spontaneous arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area have been irradiated. This method seems to hold promise in neurosurgical practice. Extension of the range of clinical applications of proton beam therapy in neurosurgery requires the development of various techniques of irradiation, all possible approaches to various targets on the basis of contemporary methods of computerized diagnosis, topometry and irradiation design

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

DESIGN: Randomized dose-ranging clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with angiographic evidence of classic choroidal neovascularization resulting from AMD and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better. METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 16-cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) or 24-CGE proton radiation in 2 equal fractions. Visual acuity was measured using standardized protocol refraction. Complete ophthalmological examinations, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of eyes losing 3 or more lines of vision from baseline. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare cumulative rates of vision loss between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS: At 12 months after treatment, 36 eyes (42%) and 27 eyes (35%) lost 3 or more lines of vision in the 16-CGE and 24-CGE groups, respectively. Rates increased to 62% in the 16-CGE group and 53% in the 24-CGE group by 24 months after treatment (P = 0.40). Radiation complications developed in 15.7% of patients receiving 16 CGE and 14.8% of patients receiving 24 CGE. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in rates of visual loss were found between the 2 dose groups. Proton radiation may be useful as an adjuvant therapy or as an alternative for patients who decline or are not appropriate for approved therapies

This report is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred and six patients in stages T2b (B2), T2c (B2), and T3 (C) were treated with 45 Gy photon-beam irradiation to the pelvis and an additional 30 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) to the prostate with 250-MeV protons, yielding a total prostate dose of 75 CGE in 40 fractions. Median follow-up time was 20.2 months (range: 10-30 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system; local control was evaluated by serial digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements. RESULTS: Morbidity evaluation was available on 104 patients. The actuarial 2-year rate of Grade 1 or 2 late morbidity was 12% (8% rectal, 4% urinary). No patients demonstrated Grade 3 or 4 late morbidity. Treatment response was evaluated on 100 patients with elevated pretreatment serum PSA levels. The actuarial 2-year rate of PSA normalization was 96%, 97%, and 63% for pretreatment PSAs of > 4-10, > 10-20, and > 20, respectively. The 13 patients with rising PSA demonstrated local recurrence (3 patients), distant metastasis (8 patients), or no evidence of disease except increasing PSA (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of side effects, despite the tumor dose of 75 CGE, demonstrates that conformal protons can deliver higher doses of radiation to target tissues without increasing complications to surrounding normal tissues. The initial tumor response, as assessed by the high actuarial rate of normalization with pretreatment PSA < or = 20, and the low rate of recurrences within the treatment field (2.8%), are encouraging

Many locally extended, radioresistant lesions, lesions with large volume and small radiocurable lesions in this series revealed sufficient improvement without definite late damage in the surrounding normal tissues. This clinical result suggests that proton beam treatment could be applied to lesions in a much wider range for curative purposes as compared with conventional radiotherapy.

This conjunctival melanoma arose from primary acquired melanosis with atypia at the temporal corneoscleral limbus. The patient was treated using a combination of surgical excision with physical treatment by ocular proton therapy. Progression remained under control 11 months after treatment: no local tumour recurrence or metastasis was observed. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia must be regarded as a premalignant melanocytic lesion. Based on this case report, the authors focus on primary acquired melanosis and its risk of transformation to a conjunctival malignant melanoma

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation.

Both radical surgical removal and high-dose radiation therapy, particularly proton beam therapy, reportedly are effective in tumor control and improve survival rates. The authors posit that these tumors are best treated with radical surgery and proton-photon beam therapy. During the last 5 years, they treated 25 patients (15 females and 10 males) who harbored pathologically diagnosed skull base chordomas. The mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range 8-61 years). Previous surgery or radiation therapy was performed at other institutions in seven and two patients, respectively. The authors performed 33 surgical procedures on 23 patients. Radical removal (defined as absence of residual tumor on operative inspection and postoperative imaging) was achieved in 10 patients; subtotal resection (defined as resection of > 90% of the tumor) was achieved in 11 patients; and partial resection (defined as resection of < 90% of the tumor) was achieved in two patients. Radical surgical removal included not only the excision of soft-tumor tissue, but also extensive drilling of the adjacent bone. Adjuvant therapy consisted of postoperative combined proton-photon beam therapy (given to 17 patients and planned for one patient) and conventional radiation therapy (two patients); three patients received no adjunct therapy. To date, four patients have died. One patient who had undergone previous surgery and sacrifice of the internal carotid artery died postoperatively from a massive stroke; one patient died from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without evidence of recurrence; and two patients died at 25 and 39 months of recurrent tumor. Permanent neurological complications included third cranial nerve palsy (one patient) and hemianopsia (one patient); radiation necrosis occurred in three patients. Of the 21 patients followed for more than 3 months after surgery, 16 have had no evidence of recurrence and five (including the two mortalities noted above) have had recurrent tumors (four diagnosed clinically and one radiologically). The mean disease-free interval was 14.4 months. A longer follow-up period will, hopefully, support the early indication that radical surgical removal and postoperative proton-photon beam therapy is an efficacious treatment. The use of skull base approaches based on the tumor classification introduced in this paper is associated with low mortality and morbidity rates

The most common histological types are adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas and malignant mixed tumors. The results of conventional radiotherapy are suboptimal in inoperable or incompletely resected salivary gland tumors and in recurrent disease. The pooled data of some international series for low linear energy transfer radiation show a local control of 28%. Especially in advanced tumors neutron therapy can improve local control and should be the treatment of choice. The clinical data from different therapy centers in Europe show local control of 67% in gross disease. [References: 44]

Target volumes are irradiated using sequential 1.68-cm-thick slices with the patient moved between each successive slice delivery. Due to the method of delivery, superficial doses from a course of intensity modulated radiation therapy may be significantly different from doses delivered with conventional radiation therapy. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the superficial depth-dose distribution for geometric target volumes. Treatment plans were conducted for 5-cm-diam, 5-cm-long right cylindrical target volumes embedded in a 16-cm-diam, 12-cm-long water-equivalent cylindrical phantom. Three experiments were conducted with centrally located, off-centered, and superficial targets. Doses at superficial depths were measured using 3 x 3 x 1 mm3 thermoluminescent dosimetry chips. For all three targets, the measured doses were slightly greater than the calculated doses. Doses measured in the buildup region for the superficial target indicated that bolus would be required to provide the prescribed dose at the phantom surface

We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94%. One patient (2.2%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg

A total of 184 patients were treated. The authors have been of opinion that therapeutic methods depended on function of the neuroendocrine system and adrenal cortex, e. g. reserpine used after gamma-therapy alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy increased the efficacy of therapy and reduced the time of remission. Parlodel used alone or in combination with chloditan could be used in therapy of early forms of the disease in young patients. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy and proton beam therapy of the hypophysis were recommended in hypophysial adenomas. Proton beam therapy of the hypophysis was an effective method for therapy of patients with diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and could be used in diffuse nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1983 proton radiotherapy using 250 MeV proton beams produced by a booster synchrotron of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics has been carried out at Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. As of September 1990, a total of 147 patients received a partial or full treatment with proton beams with curative intent; 92 patients (63%) were treated with proton beams alone and 55 patients (37%) with combined photon and proton beams. There were 91 males and the mean age was 61.8 years old. The follow-up observation period ranged from 10 to 97 months. With regard to a total tumor dose, nearly 80% of patients received 70 Gy or more and 53% received 80 Gy or more. While dose-fractionations used depended upon tumor sites, the large majority of patients received substantially high radiation doses in terms of larger total doses (> 70 Gy) and larger fraction sizes (> 2.5 Gy) than those traditionally used. This fractionation regimen has been used because of limited availability of the accelerator or a shortage of machine time (27-30 weeks/year, 3-3.5 hr/day), and also by the expectation that the superior dose distribution possible with protons will permit administration of high radiation doses without increasing morbidities. In connection with this, we have determined the target volume by setting margins around the tumor boundary as practically small as possible, ranging from 5 to 10 mm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current trial has been based on a site and dose searching program, hence a wide variety of tumor sites including the aerodigestive organs has been treated. So far, our judgment is that proton therapy has proven of potential advantage in treatment of the lung, esophageal, liver, uterine cervix, prostate, and head and neck malignancies; and of possible value in treatment of high-grade gliomas, and gastric, urinary bladder, and pediatric tumors

First, an analysis of treatment angle combinations for 50 patients treated with conventional conformal radiation therapy is performed. In a second step, nine treatment plans for a hypothetical heavy ion gantry were prepared. Finally, cylindrical projections of the organs at risk are introduced as a tool to analyse the distribution of treatment angles as well as the treatment geometry for each patient. The results of the analysis for conventional therapy clearly show treatment angle combinations that are preferably used. These findings are also supported by the geometrical analysis using the cylindrical projections. The majority of treatment angles for heavy ions also seem to be confined to those regions. In one case, however, the sharp distal dose fall-off of the heavy ions allowed a beam direction outside these conventionally used regions. The advantages of a heavy ion gantry versus a fixed horizontal beam line are shown by comparison of treatment plans for both systems. Treatment angle combinations are suggested that should be accessible for any beam line design using either fixed beams or a gantry

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred and twenty-one cases of NPC, treated in the Cancer Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), with computed tomography scanning before initial radiotherapy, are analyzed. Important prognostic factors that form the basis of the new staging system are screened out by means of Cox model and clinical experiences. Survival curves of various kinds of T and N stages are compared by computer simulation. A new staging system is proposed by studying the traditional staging systems such as the AJC, UICC, Ho's and Changsha systems. RESULTS: According to the new staging criteria, the 5-year survival rates for Stages I-IV are 89.7%, 75.9%, 51.3%, and 22.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new clinical staging for NPC based on a large amount of cases multivariate analysis is satisfactory and widely used in China

METHODS: Fifteen patients (average age, 48.6 years) with biopsy-proved cervical cancer were included in the study. After clinical staging (FIGO classification), MR imaging with body coil (BCMR) and subsequently with endorectal surface coil (ECMR) was performed. Using a 1.5-Tesla unit, axial and sagittal proton density weighted and spin echo T2-weighted and fast spin echo T2-weighted sequences were obtained with body and endorectal surface coil. During imaging analysis, special attention was paid to the uterine zones, the vaginal fornix, and the parametrial tissue. Ten patients were treated surgically (postsurgical histopathology was considered the gold standard), five patients, all clinically staged IIIb, underwent primary radiation therapy. RESULTS: Clinical staging with FIGO classification was accurate in 12 of 15 patients, and understaged in 2 and overstaged in 1 patient. Body coil MR showed accurate staging in 13 of 15 patients. Using this technique, understaging of 2 patients, both with only minimal tumor infiltration depth (< 8 mm), was performed. Endorectal surface coil MR was accurate in 14 of 15 patients missing minimal parametrial tumor infiltration in 1 patient. Histopathology (n = 10) revealed 3 patients with tumor stage T1b, 2 with stage T2a, and 5 patients with stage T2b. CONCLUSIONS: Although suggested by only a small number of patients, ECMR appears to be the most accurate modality for staging cervical carcinomas but seems to be unreliable in the detection of minimal tumor infiltration

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy

METHODS: Over a 20-year period, 47 patients underwent 72 operative procedures for resection of cranial base chondrosarcomas. Thirty-three patients were previously untreated, whereas 14 patients previously had undergone surgery or radiation. Twenty-three patients had a single operation and 24 underwent staged (more than one) operations because of extensive disease. Patients who underwent subtotal resection also underwent radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Patients were evaluated at follow-up clinically and by imaging studies. RESULTS: Gross total resection was accomplished in 29 (61.7%) patients, and subtotal resection was accomplished in 18 patients (38.3%). The resection was better in patients who underwent a primary operation (gross total resection, 68.8 versus 46.7%) rather than a reoperation. Patients who underwent incomplete resection underwent postoperative radiotherapy, which included proton beam radiotherapy (15.6%), radiosurgery (68%), and fractionated radiation (15.6%). There were no operative deaths. Postoperative complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage, quadriparesis, infections, cranial nerve palsies, etc.) were observed in 10 patients (18%). The follow-up ranged from 2 to 255 months, with an average of 86 months. At the conclusion of study, 36 (76.6%) patients were alive, and 21 (44.7%) patients were alive without disease. Recurrence-free survival was 32% at 10 years in all patients, 42.3% in primary patients and 13.8% in those who underwent reoperation. The Karnofsky performance score was 82.4 +/- 9.8 before surgery, 85 +/- 12.5 at 1 year after surgery, and 85.3 +/- 5.8 at the latest follow-up. Two patients died as a result of radiotherapy complications (malignancy, radiation necrosis). CONCLUSION: Cranial base chondrosarcomas can be managed well by complete surgical resection or by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The study cannot comment about the efficacy of radiotherapy. Approximately half of the patients survived without recurrence at long-term follow-up (>132 mo). The functional status of the surviving patients was excellent at follow-up

METHODS: Retrospective review of the charts of patients with iris melanoma treated by proton beam therapy between April 1998 and September 2002. Ciliary body melanomas with iris involvement or tumours with extrascleral invasion were excluded. Treatment consisted of 60 Gy of proton beam irradiation delivered in four fractions to the tumour volume. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated, median follow-up of 33 months (8-72 months). 15 patients presented a lesion with documented growth. The median clinical diameter was 5 mm (2-8 mm), the median ultrasound diameter 4.8 mm (2-7.7 mm) The patients were 6% T1, 57.1% T2, and 14.3% T3 all N0M0. The iridocorneal angle was invaded by the tumour in 71.4% of patients. At the end of follow-up, all patients were alive with no proven metastatic disease except one patient with suspicious liver lesions. None of the patients showed tumour progression or ocular relapse. The tumour response at 2 years was a flat lesion for 6.3% of cases, partial regression in 75% and stable in 18.8%. None of the patients required secondary enucleation. The main complication was cataract (45% within 24 months of treatment). Raised intraocular pressure was observed in 15% of patients but no neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy shows potential utility for selected cases of localised iris melanomas allowing excellent local tumour control and eye preservation. Further follow-up on larger series is needed to confirm these results

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1994 to March 2000, 163 patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Analysis was performed on 54 optic nerves (ONs) corresponding to 30 patients whose ONs had been included in the irradiated volume. These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of >4 years. All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before treatment. We evaluated the dose-complication probability and the prognostic factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon ion radiotherapy, using dose-volume histograms and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age of 30 patients (14 men, 16 women) was 57.2 years. Median prescribed total dose was 56.0 gray equivalents (GyE) at 3.0-4.0 GyE per fraction per day (range, 48-64 GyE; 16-18 fractions; 4-6 weeks). Of 54 ONs that were analyzed, 35 had been irradiated with <57 GyE (maximum dose [Dmax]) resulting in no visual loss. Conversely, 11 of the 19 ONs (58%) irradiated with >57 GyE (Dmax) suffered a decrease of visual acuity. In all of these cases, the ONs had been involved in the tumor before carbon ion radiotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, a dose of 20% of the volume of the ON (D20) was significantly associated with visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of visual loss seems to be correlated with a delivery of >60 GyE to 20% of the volume of the ON

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy.

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

[Review] [17 refs]	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cost-Benefit Analysis, Equipment Design, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic, X-Rays	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a term applied to a new technology that uses nonuniform radiation beams to achieve conformal dose distributions. This article reviews the use of a commercial system, the Peacock system, which uses a special multileaf collimator (MIMiC) to deliver the dose distribution using arc therapy and segmented fields, similar to a moving strip. Although initially designed for stereotactic radiosurgery, this system has been employed to treat various body sites. More than 300 patients have been treated at our institution in the past 4 years, mainly for cranial, head-and-neck, and prostate tumors. Presently, we treat 40 to 45 patients per day with this technology using two linear accelerators operating with 10 MV and 15 MV x-rays, as Peacock has become a standard therapy procedure. Cases are presented that show the unique ability of IMRT to deliver conformal dose distributions. Why this type of technology can become a standard procedure and why it is cost-effective therapy for both the institution and the patient are discussed. [References: 17]

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

The treatment planning for dynamic radiosurgery is a three-dimensional problem, since during treatment both the gantry and the couch rotate simultaneously, the gantry from 30 degrees to 330 degrees and the couch from 75 degrees to - 75 degrees. The patient surface and anatomical information is obtained from a family of computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans, and a stereotactic frame is used for target localization, treatment setup, and patient immobilization during the treatment. The dose calculational algorithm follows the gantry and couch rotation in an incremental fashion, and relies on measured stationary beam central axis percentage depth doses and dose profiles to calculate the normalized tissue-maximum-ratio distributions over a matrix of points defined on one of three orthogonal planes (transverse, sagittal, or coronal). The dose calculation algorithm is discussed in detail and calculated dose distributions for single plane and dynamic radiosurgery compared with measured data	
1	791	Phase II study of radiotherapy employing proton beam for hepatocellular carcinoma	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Comorbidity, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Informed Consent, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/cl [Classification], Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Patient Selection, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Safety, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of proton beam radiotherapy (PRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality	
0	3260	Photoneutrons from high energy medical linear accelerators: measurement of the spectrum and dose using a miniature proportional counter	Humans, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Pressure, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: A new method of measuring photoneutron dose to the patient during treatment with high energy photon or electron beams is presented. This method has the advantage of providing not only the dose, but the microdosimetric spectrum at the same time. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A miniature cylindrical gas proportional counter (0.5 mm diameter by 0.5 mm height) has been used to measure scatter radiation from a 20 MV teletherapy photon beam. At atmospheric pressure, filled with propane base tissue equivalent gas, this counter simulates a unit density tissue region of approximately 0.9 microns. We present here single event microdosimetric spectra measured outside the primary beam 1.4 m from the target. This technique allows a single measurement to determine the scattered dose due to gammas and photoneutron contamination, as well as the quality factor of the photoneutrons. RESULTS: Spectral components from scattered photons and the photoneutrons are easily separated, and dose contributions can be estimated. The ratio of photoneutron dose measured by the proportional counter to photon dose at isocenter is 0.75 x 10(-4). CONCLUSIONS: Neutron dose was also measured using a bubble neutrometer. The proportional counter and neutrometer agree within experimental errors. This type of instrument is shown to be a viable technique for determination of exposure of patient and also personnel to photoneutrons, providing not only a dose determination, but also a spectrum that can be used to estimate quality factors for equivalent dose. Its main drawback is that it requires a lengthy (several hours) measurement because of low count rate of the neutrons

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen cases of metastatic melanoma involving intraocular tissues, 6 cases of metastatic melanoma in the orbit, and 1 case of metastatic melanoma involving both the eye and the orbit, treated in Lausanne between 1986 and 2002, were identified from the computer files of the ocular oncology and orbitopalpebral surgery units of Jules Gonin Hospital. METHODS: The analysis is based on the demographic data concerning these patients, clinical data concerning the tumor, the treatment applied, the outcome, and the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation of intraocular and orbital metastasis, interval between primary tumor and ocular metastasis, survival of the patients, evaluation of various therapeutic protocols. RESULTS: Intraocular metastases (14 cases, 15 eyes) were situated in the choroid in 11 cases (isolated lesion, 6 cases; multiple lesions, 3 cases; diffuse involvement, 2 cases), in the iris and ciliary body in 2 cases, and in the retina and vitreous in 2 other cases. The primary tumor was a cutaneous melanoma in 8 cases, a melanoma of the contralateral eye in 3 cases, a mucosal melanoma in 1 case, and was unknown in 2 cases. The mean interval between the diagnosis of ocular metastases and the patient's death was 8.8 months (range, 1-48 months). The primary tumor in the 7 cases of orbital metastases was a cutaneous melanoma in 5 cases, a uveal melanoma in the contralateral eye in 1 case, and was unknown in 1 case. The mean interval between the diagnosis of orbital metastases and death was 19.7 months (range, 5-48 months). The patients were treated by various protocols. The best results, in terms of both local tumor control and preservation of visual function, were obtained with circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or external beam irradiation, depending on the site and extent of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic melanomas to the eye and orbit are rare and generally occur in patients with disseminated metastases during the terminal stages of the disease, with a short life expectancy. Treatment is palliative and, among the various possible treatment options, circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or global photon beam radiotherapy, at relatively high irradiation doses, seems to achieve the most favorable results

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects	
1	2721	Dosimetric results from a feasibility study of a novel radiosurgical source for irradiation of intracranial metastases	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Electric Power Supplies, Equipment Design, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Self Care, Survival, Time, X-Rays	PURPOSE: A feasibility study addressing the role of a new miniature x-ray device, the Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS), for interstitial radiosurgical treatment of intracranial metastatic neoplasms, was conducted at our institution. To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma	
0	4492	Macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation. 10-year follow-up observation with histopathologic correlation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/pa [Pathology], Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Risk, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Although patients with choroidal melanoma within 3 mm of both the optic nerve and fovea are at higher risk for visual loss after proton beam irradiation, half of the patients in this study with visual acuity better than 20/200 before treatment maintained this level of vision for at least 2 years. Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation	
1	2917	Metastasis from uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Humans, Incidence, Liver, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Time, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The incidence of metastasis and prognostic factors for metastasis in 780 consecutive patients with uveal melanomas treated with proton beam irradiation were evaluated. Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis	
0	2667	Execution of a single-isocenter three-field technique, using a multileaf collimator or tray-mounted cerrobend blocks: effect on treatment time	Axilla, Belgium, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Female, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Time, Time Factors, Universities	PURPOSE: In this article, we studied the total treatment time of a single-isocenter three-field irradiation of breast and axilla, using either tray-mounted cerrobend blocks, or a multileaf collimator (MLC) for field shaping. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 20 female, unselected patients were given 50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) on breast and 46 Gy on axilla and supraclavicular region (2 Gy/fraction). Patients were randomized between two different treatment groups. The first group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-75 linear accelerator (SL-75), using 5 MV photons with tray-mounted cerrobend blocks. The second group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-25 linear accelerator, using 6 MV photons and a MLC (SL-25-MLC). RESULTS: Although the beam-on time on the SL-25-MLC was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to the SL-75, overall treatment time was significantly shorter using a MLC instead of tray-mounted cerrobend blocks (p < 0.0001). The difference in total treatment time was in the range of 100 s per patient per day. The main difference between the two accelerators was observed when setup of the second and third field was done using the automatic setup facility of the SL-25-MLC (avoids entering the treatment room). A mean time gain of 124 s per treatment session was observed using automatic setup. Considering the yearly number of patients receiving this treatment, a total time gain equivalent to 16.15 8-h workdays was calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a technique using tray-mounted cerrobend blocks in the single-isocenter three-field irradiation of a breast and axilla, a MLC combined with automatic field setup provides a significant time advantage, by reducing the number of manipulations inside the treatment room	
1	643	[Results of treating uveal melanoma with proton beam radiation: 10-year follow-up]. [French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Optic Disk, Radiation, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: We analyzed the long-term results of uveal melanoma treatment with proton beam irradiation in a series of patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were treated with proton beam radiation between September 1991 and December 1992. They had an initial examination including visual acuity, funduscopy, A and B scan ultrasonography of the eye, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. General examination included chest radiography and B scan ultrasonography of the liver. All tumors received a total dose of 60 cobalt-Gray equivalents (applied in four daily fractions) at the Orsay proton therapy center. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were treated with a median follow-up of 116 months. Their median age was 59 years. Thirteen tumors were anterior to the equator, 76 overlapped the equator and 78 were posterior to the equator. An initial retinal detachment was present in 41 cases. The optic disk was invaded in 10 cases. The median tumor diameter was 12 mm and the median tumor thickness was 5.8 mm. The mean initial acuity was 20/50. The survival rate was 62.93% at 10 years; 72.9% of deaths resulted from metastasis. Statistically significant risk factors for death identified in the multivariate analysis were tumor diameter greater than 12 mm (p=0.0004) and age over 60 years (p=0.0001). The metastasis rate at 10 years was 31%. The liver was affected in 97.8% of these patients. Risk factors for metastasis were the anterior site of the tumor, its volume greater than 0.4 cc and the presence of retinal detachment at diagnosis. The secondary enucleation rate at 10 years was 13.23%, mainly attributable to secondary neovascular glaucoma. The local recurrence rate was 6%. The visual acuity rate in 42.1% of patients was better than 20/100 at 10 years. Visual loss was mainly due to postradiation maculopathy and neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the long-term results found in the literature on proton beam radiation. This therapy allows good tumor control, an excellent eye retention rate, and good final visual acuity for approximately half of the patients	
1	1140	Treatment planning comparison of conventional, 3D conformal, and intensity-modulated photon (IMRT) and proton therapy for paranasal sinus carcinoma	Austria, Humans, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinuses/ra [Radiography], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Planning Techniques, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To determine the potential improvements in patients with paranasal sinus carcinoma by comparing proton and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with conventional and conformal photon treatment planning techniques. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities	
1	2829	Effects of treatment setup variation on beam's eye view dosimetry for radiation therapy using the multileaf collimator vs. the cerrobend block	Equipment Design, Eye, Film Dosimetry, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Neck, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pelvis, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Water	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to quantify and compare retrospectively the effects of treatment setup variation on beam's eye view (BEV) dosimetry for radiation therapy using a multileaf collimator (MLC) vs. cerrobend block. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices	
1	4678	Phase II feasibility study of high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer using proton boost therapy: first clinical trial of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer in Japan	Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Feasibility Studies, Gastrointestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Humans, Japan, Male, Male Urogenital Diseases/et [Etiology], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Patients, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Proctitis/et [Etiology], Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Safety, Seminal Vesicles, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome, Urination Disorders/et [Etiology]	OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer using proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy. METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan

The treatment technique consists of several moving field irradiations in noncoplanar planes at a linear accelerator facility. Using collimated narrow beams, a high concentration of dose within small volumes with a dose gradient of 10-15%/mm was obtained. The dose calculation was based on geometrical information of multiplanar CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system, which is usable at CT, MR, and positron emission tomography (PET) installations. Special computer programs for correction of the geometrical MR distortions allowed a precise correlation of the different imaging modalities. The therapist can use combinations of CT, MR, and PET data for defining target volume. For instance, the superior soft tissue contrast of MR coupled with the metabolic features of PET may be a useful addition in the radiation treatment planning process. Furthermore, other features such as calculated dose distribution to critical structures can also be transferred from one set of imaging data to another and can be displayed as three-dimensional shaded structures	
1	556	Accelerated partial-breast irradiation using proton beams: initial clinical experience	Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/px [Psychology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast/pa [Pathology], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Esthetics, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Massachusetts, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Patient Satisfaction, Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Telangiectasis/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: We present our initial clinical experience with proton, three-dimensional, conformal, external beam, partial-breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance	
0	4057	Comparison of proton and x-ray conformal dose distributions for radiosurgery applications	Biophysics, Boston, Brain, Humans, Massachusetts, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Technology,Radiologic, X-Rays	Highly focused dose distributions for radiosurgery applications are successfully achieved using either multiple static high-energy particle beams or multiple-arc circular x-ray beams from a linac. It has been suggested that conformal x-ray techniques using dynamically shaped beams with a moving radiation source would offer advantages compared to the use of only circular beams. It is also thought that, generally, charged particle beams such as protons offer dose deposition advantages compared to x-ray beams. A comparison of dose distributions was made between a small number of discrete proton beams, multiple-arc circular x-ray beams, and conformal x-ray techniques. Treatment planning of a selection of radiosurgery cases was done for these three techniques. Target volumes ranged from 1.0-25.0 cm3. Dose distributions and dose volume histograms of the target and surrounding normal brain were calculated. The advantages and limitations of each technique were primarily dependent upon the shape and size of the target volume. In general, proton dose distributions were superior to x-ray distributions; both shaped proton and shaped x-ray beams delivered dose distributions which were more conformal than x-ray techniques using circular beams; and the differences between all proton and x-ray distributions were negligible for the smallest target volumes, and greatest for the larger target volumes

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation	
0	2470	Proton therapy for carcinoma of the nasopharynx: a study in comparative treatment planning	Adult, Anatomy, Boston, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/di [Diagnosis], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Planning Techniques, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is technically difficult because of the complexity of the regional anatomy and the natural history of the disease. The results of a study are presented showing how detailed diagnostic information available from MRI is helpful in defining the target volume to be irradiated and the critical normal structures. By using 3-dimensional planning techniques, an assessment was made of the relative merits of proton beam therapy and of X ray treatment for patients with early stage and locally advanced carcinoma of the nasopharynx. For both types of patient, the study suggests that the use of protons for the major part of treatment results in a more even distribution of dose to the tumor and an increase of approximately 5 Gy in median tumor dose with substantial reductions in doses to adjacent normal tissues. The superior dose distributions possible with protons should translate into improved local control and reduced morbidity. The difficulties of proton treatment planning for this site are addressed	
0	1076	The use of an aSi-based EPID for routine absolute dosimetric pre-treatment verification of dynamic IMRT fields	Algorithms, Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, Silicon, Software, Water	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In parallel with the increased use of intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) fields in radiation therapy, flat panel amorphous silicon (aSi) detectors are becoming the standard for online portal imaging at the linear accelerator. In order to minimise the workload related to the quality assurance of the IMRT fields, we have explored the possibility of using a commercially available aSi portal imager for absolute dosimetric verification of the delivery of dynamic IMRT fields. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the basic dosimetric characteristics of an aSi portal imager (aS500, Varian Medical Systems), using an acquisition mode especially developed for portal dose (PD) integration during delivery of a-static or dynamic-radiation field. Secondly, the dose calculation algorithm of a commercially available treatment planning system (Cadplan, Varian Medical Systems) was modified to allow prediction of the PD image, i.e. to compare the intended fluence distribution with the fluence distribution as actually delivered by the dynamic multileaf collimator. Absolute rather than relative dose prediction was applied. The PD image prediction was compared to the corresponding acquisition for several clinical IMRT fields by means of the gamma evaluation method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The acquisition mode is accurate in integrating all PD over a wide range of monitor units, provided detector saturation is avoided. Although the dose deposition behaviour in the portal image detector is not equivalent to the dose to water measurements, it is reproducible and self-consistent, lending itself to quality assurance measurements. Gamma evaluations of the predicted versus measured PD distribution were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria for all clinical IMRT fields, i.e. allowing a dose difference of 3% of the local field dose in combination with a distance to agreement of 3 mm	
0	1014	Improved treatment of pelvis and inguinal nodes using modified segmental boost technique: dosimetric evaluation	Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Film Dosimetry, Humans, Inguinal Canal, Lymphatic Irradiation/mt [Methods], Particle Accelerators, Pelvic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pelvis, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To describe a novel, yet simple, modified segmental boost technique (MSBT) and to compare the dosimetry of our method with that of other traditional methods of treatment for the pelvis and inguinal nodes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a radiotherapy technique that uses linear accelerators with multileaf collimators to treat the pelvis and sequentially boost the inguinal regions, while minimizing "hot spots" across the match-line. This was achieved by angling the gantry for the inguinal fields so that their medial borders aligned with the divergence of the posterior pelvic field. Film dosimetry was performed to compare the MSBT with the traditional segmental boost technique, partial transmission block, and photon/electron combination techniques. These treatment techniques were scored on the basis of the dose homogeneity index, defined as the ratio of match-line maximum dose to the average dose at a given depth in the groin treatment area. RESULTS: The values of the dose homogeneity index were the same (1.04) for MSBT and partial transmission block, and 1.21, 1.39, and 1.18 for the segmental boost technique, photon pelvis with electron tags, and photon pelvis with electron boost, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MSBT proved to be technically simple while optimizing dose homogeneity compared with the other techniques and allows for maximum use of the features of modern linear accelerators	
1	1487	Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hearing, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/pa [Pathology], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Patient Satisfaction, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time	PURPOSE: The proton beam's Bragg peak permits highly conformal radiation of skull base tumors. This study, prompted by reports of transient (30% each) and permanent (10% each) facial and trigeminal neuropathy after stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas with marginal doses of 16-20 Gy, assessed whether proton beam radiosurgery using a marginal dose of only 12 Gy could control vestibular schwannomas while causing less neuropathy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 67 years) were treated between 1992 and 1998. The mean tumor volume was 2.49 cm(3). The dose to the tumor margin (70% isodose line) was 12 Gy. The prospectively specified follow-up consisted of neurologic evaluation and MRI at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: After a mean clinical follow-up of 44 months and imaging follow-up of 34 months in 64 patients, 35 tumors (54.7%) were smaller and 25 (39.1%) were unchanged (tumor control rate 94%; actuarial control rate 94% at 2 years and 84% at 5 years). Three tumors enlarged: one shrank after repeated radiosurgery, one remained enlarged at the time of unrelated death, and one had not been imaged for 4 years in a patient who remained asymptomatic at last follow-up. Intratumoral hemorrhage into one stable tumor required craniotomy that proved successful. Thus, 97% of tumors required no additional treatment. Three patients (4.7%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus evident as increased ataxia. Of 6 patients with functional hearing ipsilaterally, 1 improved, 1 was unchanged, and 4 progressively lost hearing. Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications

[French]	Anterior Eye Segment, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Ciliary Body, Ciliary Body/us [Ultrasonography], Eye, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography]	BACKGROUND: Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) is a new ophthalmological imaging technique essentially designed for the study of the anterior eye segment. Over the last 10 months, we've evaluated its contribution to the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by means of accelerated proton beam irradiation. MATERIAL: Using UBM, we have examined 55 cases of uveal melanoma's, whose anterior border was situated at 6 mm or less from the limbus and that were consequently treated by proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The presumed tumoral origin was the ciliary body's pars plicata in 13 cases and the pars plana or the choroid in 42 cases, 17 of which presented a tumoral invasion of the pars plicata. A pars plana detachment anterior to or surrounding the anterior tumoral border, was present in 22 cases. The height of the tumor could only be measured by UBM if it was less than 2.5 mm. Information gathered using UBM have contributed to an improvement of the therapy plan in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Because of the strong attenuation of the high frequency ultrasound signal, UBM can only be used for the examination of intra-ocular structures situated in direct neighbourhood to the global wall. Despite this technical limitation, ist contribution to the planning of the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by proton beam irradiation has appeared to be considerable

The analysis of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes after irradiation by the accelerated ions 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon and LET 10.7 keV/microm was carried out. Blood samples were irradiated on Nuclotron of the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The doses of irradiation were in the range from 0.05 up to 1.0 Gy. Was shown that the frequency of unstable chromosome aberrations depends from the dose of ionizing radiation and can be described by linear function. At the doses 0.25-0.50 Gy the dose-independent curve was obtained for dicentrics and centric rings. The frequencies of dicentrics and centric rings as markers of the radiation action were slightly different for different donors that could be explained by different radiosensitivity. Using the calibration curve obtained earlier for gamma-rays coefficients of relative biological efficiency of accelerated 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon were defined: they varied from 1.0 at the doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) up to 3.2 at the lower doses (0.05-0.25 Gy)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site	
0	3350	Radiotherapy technologist dose from high-energy electron medical accelerators	Electrons, Film Dosimetry, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic/ma [Manpower], Time	Whole-body doses incurred by radiation therapy technologists working with 18- and 24-MV medical linear accelerators have been measured at two clinics under normal working conditions with a sensitive solid-state personal dosimeter. The results based on 84 treatments indicate that average monthly doses in the range 12-19 mrem can be expected for 30 daily treatments similar to those monitored. It was also found that 76% of the in-room dose was due to activated components in the treatment head, the balance of the in-room dose being due to activated concrete. Other statistics were obtained on patient in-room times and technologist times and doses outside the treatment room. Although the monthly film dosimetry records show no detectable doses for technologists working with these particular machines, in the spirit of ALARA, steps have been taken to reduce residual activities even further by choice of material less susceptible to activation

The patient characteristics were no different from those noted in previous studies. Patients were treated either with 60Co teletherapy units or 4 MeV linear accelerators with different daily (180-225) and weekly (4 times vs. 5 times) fractionation schemes. A recurrent-free survival was attained in 80% of the patients 2 years after primary treatment with radiation therapy. There were 27 local recurrences, of which 82% were salvaged with surgery for an overall adjusted survival of 95%. Patients treated on 60Co units with field sizes less than or equal to 30 sq. cm had a 15% increase in local recurrence compared with field size greater than 30 sq. cm, which could not be attributed to lower doses. Poorly differentiated tumors and those involving the anterior commissure were more likely to develop a local recurrence. Doses above 1900 ret were associated with a decrease in local recurrence in patients having anterior commissure involvement. Salvage with limited surgery for failure was effective in selected cases

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles

A second set of lateral lasers was mounted approximately 20 cm below the isocentre allowing patient positioning at an ergonomical height. A small randomised study involving 16 heavy patients treated for pelvic malignancies demonstrated that using the lower lasers for patient set-up is not only likely to reduce strain on staff but also speed up the set-up process

1	2643	Anterior segment sparing to reduce charged particle radiotherapy complications in uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Anterior Eye Segment, California, Californium, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Helium, Helium/ae [Adverse Effects], Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation is to delineate the risk factors in the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) after helium-ion irradiation of uveal melanoma patients and to propose treatment technique that may reduce this risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

The external therapy with telecobalt or by an 18 MeV betatron was dosed from 3000 to 4000 rads. Most of the patients received an additional single intraperitoneal application of 150 mCi gold-198. The five-year survival rate of all patients was 45%, whereas it was 71% for stage I, 47% for stage II, 21% for stage III, and 4% for stage IV. In 3% out of all cases, surgical procedure was necessary because of complications. Today, an indication for intraperitoneal therapy by radioactive isotopes is only adopted in case of a ruptured malignant ovarian tumor

The patient lies on a low couch and receives exposure in the prone and supine positions from a modulated arcing beam. The technique has been validated using a personal computer to control the linear accelerator and we demonstrate that only minor alterations to current dynamic therapy systems would be required. We have examined the practical application of this treatment with emphasis on methods of conformal therapy where an optimized dose distribution is prepared from a matrix of caliper measurements taken from the patient. This technique provides a means for regular TBI treatment on a computer-controlled linear accelerator that is easy to set up, requires short exposure times and is comfortable for the patient

It can be a very useful complement of traditional microsurgery, pharmacotherapy or fractionated radiotherapy which are seldom a sufficient treatment on their own. The modern radiosurgery does not offer the experience representative enough in this indication. We can offer results of medium long follow-up for tumor growth and hormonal hypersecretion of pituitary adenomas in a relatively large series of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analyzed a group of 163 patients with pituitary adenoma treated with gamma knife during 5 years and followed 12-60 months, median 24 months after irradiation. An antiproliferative effect has been achieved in 1-2 years using the minimal dose to the margin 16-35 Gy, median 20 Gy in all our patients who were controlled by MRI (n = 126 patients). One half of these adenomas evidently decreased their size. Our effective antiproliferative dose was safe for the surrounding structures. The hormonal normalization has been achieved at 50.4% from 133 hypersecreting adenomas (39/91 = 43% of acromegalics, 11/13 = 85% of patients with Cushing's disease, 2/9 = 22% of patients with Nelson's syndrome, 11/18 = 61% of prolactinomas). The median latency was 12 months. The minimal dose to the margin was 10-45 Gy, median 35 Gy. Rare side effects were provoked only by increasing the dose to influence the hypersecretion-the development of partial hypopituitarism in 3.1% of patients, the panhypopituitarism in 0.6% of patient and there was 1 hemianopic visual field defect (0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery by gamma knife has a similar value for pituitary adenomas as microsurgery has with different distribution of advantages and drawbacks. This makes it suitable for the combined treatment where pharmacotherapy has its place under special conditions. Fractionated radiotherapy has now a marginal importance

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

To take advantage of this effect, techniques have been developed that combine existing hyperthermia devices with a linear accelerator. This allows concomitant delivery of either ultrasound or microwave hyperthermia with photon radiation therapy. Two techniques have been used clinically: the orthogonal technique, in which the microwave or ultrasound beam and the radiation beam are orthogonal to one another, and the en face technique, in which the ultrasound or microwave beam and the radiation beam travel into the tumour through the same treatment window. The en face technique has necessitated the development of special attachments so that the hyperthermia device can be mounted to the linear accelerator and so that non-uniform portions of the hyperthermia device can be removed from the radiation beam. For microwave therapy, applicators are mounted onto the linear accelerator using the compensating filter tray holder. For ultrasound, special reflector devices are mounted to a frame that is mounted onto the compensating filter tray holder of the linear accelerator. Because the linear accelerator is an isocentric device, the height of the radiation source is fixed, and this has necessitated specially designed devices so that the ultrasound support system is compatible with the linear accelerator. The treatment setups for both the en face technique and the orthogonal technique require the interaction of both hyperthermia and radiation therapy personnel and equipment. The dosimetry and day-to-day operations for each technique are unique. The simulation for the en face technique is much different from the simulation of a normal radiation treatment and requires the presence of a hyperthermia physicist. Also, for the en face technique, the attenuation of the microwave applicator and the thickness and attenuation of the ultrasound reflector system are taken into account for radiation dosimetry. This paper presents details of the dosimetry and logistics of the techniques for simultaneous thermoradiotherapy based on 7 years of experience treating more than 50 patients

Recently, both radical resection and charged-particle irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery have reportedly been found effective for tumor control and for promoting a better quality of life in patients. In this article the authors analyzed the outcomes in 17 patients with skull base chordomas who were surgically treated at Kobe University Hospital between 1972 and 2000. METHODS: Preoperative radiological examinations included magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, angiography, and balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery. Among the various surgical approaches used to remove the tumor were the frontoorbitozygomatic, transmaxillary, transcondylar, transsphenoidal, and the transbasal. Total removal was achieved in two (12%), near-total removal in three (18%), subtotal removal in nine (52%), and partial removal in three patients (18%). Since 1990, chordomas have been radically resected via various skull base approaches; the combined total or near-total removal rate has been 80% in this period. Radical removal of the tumors has not led to an increased risk. At the final follow-up review (mean 59.5 month), 75% of the patients were still alive, and 25% had died of chordoma recurrence. The overall recurrence-free survival rate was 82% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate in the five patients who underwent the operation during the past decade was 77% (mean follow up of 5.2 years). In two patients with recurrent tumors who underwent radiosurgery, no evidence of tumor regrowth was demonstrated at 3 years posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that for the treatment of skull base chordomas radical resection is a key factor for longer survival and improved quality of life. Patients with sufficiently small tumors, which show a favorable configuration and location, can be suitable candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery

The local control rate, cause-specific survival rate, and overall survival rate of 141 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC were 82%, 58%, and 42%, respectively. Radiation pneumonia was rare (2.1%) and not serious. In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate achieved in 50 patients was 100%, with no radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 60% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beam therapy, excellent local control comparable to that in stage INSCLC has been demonstrated and offers hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. A total of 2645 patients (2648 eyes) with uveal melanoma were treated between 1984 and 1999 with proton beam radiotherapy. Data were analyzed as of February 2001. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 90 years, 1284 were men, and 1361 were women. Largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 27.5 mm, and tumor height from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential, a plateau, and a linear dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 23 patients who received RT of prostate cancer. Conformal RT was used in 7 patients, 8 patients received IMRT with 6- and 15-MV photons, and 8 patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. We applied target doses ranging from 70 Gy to 100 Gy. Cancer risk was estimated as a function of target dose and tumor control probability. RESULTS: At a 100-Gy target dose the secondary cancer risk relative to the 3D treatment plan at 70 Gy was +18.4% (15.0% for a plateau model, 22.3% for a linear model) for the 6-MV IMRT plan, +25.3% (17.0%, 14.1%) for the 15-MV IMRT plan, and -40.7% (-41.3%, -40.0%) for the spot-scanned protons. The increasing risk of developing a radiation-associated malignancy after RT with increasing dose was balanced by the enhanced cure rates at a larger dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk after dose escalation for prostate RT is expected to be equal to or lower than for conventional 3D treatment at 70 Gy, independent of treatment modality or dose-response model. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice for dose escalation because this therapy can halve the risk of secondary cancers

One such method is to use positron emission tomography (PET), which takes advantage of the nuclear reactions that take place between protons and nuclei in the tissue. The dominant nuclear reaction in human muscle tissue involves oxygen nuclei and produces radioactive oxygen-15. Oxygen-15 decays through positron emission, and it is these positrons that go on to annihilate that produce the signal used in the PET technique. Finding the distribution of annihilation points, however, is not analogous to finding the proton dose distribution. The oxygen-15 and positrons travel finite distances within the tissue, blurring the detected PET distribution from the desired proton distribution. Through Monte Carlo modelling, an analysis of the differences between the positron, oxygen-15 and proton distributions has been made. The program SRIM 2003 was used to find the correlation between the three distributions within simulated muscle tissue. Results show that the distal edge of the proton Bragg peak correlates with the detectable positron distribution, which is a section of the dose distribution of interest due to the steep dose gradient and position of adjacent critical structures

Results of 5 1/2-year study	Adult, Aged, Computers, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Neoplasm Metastasis, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Proton beam irradiation was used in the treatment of 76 uveal melanomas from July 1975 to December 1980. Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

This technique divides the target into two parts, one partially surrounding the critical structure (brain stem or spinal cord) and a second excluding the critical structure and abutting the first portion of the target. Compensators are used to conform the dose distribution to the distal surface of the target. This technique represents a novel approach in treating unresectable or residual tumors surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. Since the placement of the patient with respect to beam-shaping devices is critical for divided-target treatments, a method for calculating dose distributions reflecting random patient motion is proposed, and the effects of random patient motion are studied for two divided-target patient examples. Dose-volume histograms and a normal-tissue complication probability model are used in this analysis. For the patients considered in this study, the normal-tissue-complication probability model predicts that random patient motion less than or equal to 0.2 cm is tolerable in terms of spinal cord complications

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and December 2002, 152 patients were treated at GSI with carbon ion RT. Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions. RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control was 81% for chordomas, 100% for chondrosarcomas, and 62% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas

Thirty-two patients were studied, 12 of whom underwent brachytherapy with 106Ru plaques and 20 of whom were treated with accelerated protons. After a follow-up period of 12 months, the following was observed: reduction of the thickness of the tumor (significantly greater in the tumors which underwent brachytherapy) and morphological and structural changes which consisted in a thinning of the tumor and an increased reflectivity

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas	
0	1119	Intravascular ultrasound study of the effect of beta-emitting ((55)Co) stents on vascular remodeling and intimal proliferation	Beta Rays, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Coronary Angiography, Coronary Restenosis/pc [Prevention & Control], Extremities, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radioactivity, Radioisotopes, Research, Stents, Tunica Intima/re [Radiation Effects], Ultrasonography,Interventional	The aim of this study was to evaluate vessel remodeling after implantation of high-activity (mean, 41.1 +/- 1.2 microCi) beta-emitting ((55)Co) stents. Proton bombarding in cyclotron has brought the radioactivity. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) investigation has been completed in 10 patients. The angiographies performed at 6 months revealed restenosis > 50% in five cases (50%). IVUS analysis demonstrated an absence of remodeling behind the stent, with no changes in total vessel volume (TVV; 353.6 +/- 126.3 and 343.9 +/- 90.6 mm(3)) or plaque + media volume (PMV; 171.7 +/- 57.4 and 166.8 +/- 42.6 mm(3)). On the other hand, lumen volume (LV) within the stent decreased significantly from 181.9 +/- 80.2 to 154.6 +/- 45.2 mm(3) (P < 0.02). This was due to presence of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) at both extremities of implanted stents. No chronic recoil of the implanted stents was found. The analysis of edges (5 mm distally and proximally to the last stent struts) showed no significant changes in TVV (187.3 +/- 62.60 and 176.9 +/- 53.5 mm(3)), but PMV increase significantly from 61.9 +/- 31.2 to 82.2 +/- 43.4 mm(3) (P < 0.04) and LV decreased from 125.2 +/- 40.7 to 94.7 +/- 22.0 mm(3) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, single (55)Co radioactive beta-emitting stents with high initial activity are effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia only within the stent body, as measured by IVUS, and they do not solve the problem of restenosis at the stent extremities as well as at the stent edges. Edge restenosis in this high radioactive stents was mainly (from 66%) due to neointimal proliferation. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc

Group I (194 patients) was given a combination of proton irradiation of the pituitary and sequential zone gamma-ray teletherapy of the skeleton, group II (98) received the first component and group III (162 cases)--the latter component of the modality only. Cumulative survival curves for groups I and II were well approximated by exponential function of the follow-up period; mean survival was 36.4 and 11.4 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. Within a period of about 12 months, survival curves for groups I and III were nearly identical. However, with the increasing number of bony metastases, the group III curve slope tended to match that of group II. Corresponding mean survival for that segment of the curve was 13 months. Mean survival for historic control was 12.1 months. Thus, pronounced and lasting increase in survival was not observed unless the procedures were used together	
0	1501	IMRT in the treatment of head and neck cancer: is the present already the future?.

The main causes of failure remain linked to locoregional recurrences, which are due to incomplete eradication of clonogenic cells. Conventional radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy are currently carried out at their extreme possibilities due to their intrinsic limitation--namely the impossibility to generate concave dose distributions without compromising tumor irradiation. Approximately a third of patients treated with radiotherapy and most head and neck cancer cases present concave shapes of the target volumes. With the advent of intensity modulated radiation therapy--clinically available for only few years--head and neck patients can now benefit from strategies based on highly conformal techniques. It is possible to exploit efficiently dose-escalation protocols to increase probabilities to eradicate clonogens, to reduce overall treatment time, to control repopulation problems and to keep as low as reasonably necessary the irradiation of healthy tissues minimizing acute and late complications. Today, both planning and clinical studies demonstrate these advantages but larger controlled trials are necessary to assess the true potentialities of techniques based on intensity modulation for head and neck cancers. In a speculative view, proton therapy, possibly with intensity modulation, or light ion therapy should be considered for selected cases or for reirradiation due to their higher biological efficacy and their degree of dose-conformation to target volumes.

Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans

The time-attenuation curves, time of appearance and recovery, and 3D size reduction pattern are described in patients of different ages and genders with different irradiation doses, irradiated portals, and Child groups. METHOD: Forty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 50 to 84 Gy proton beam irradiation in periods of 14-52 days. CT including noncontrast and dynamic study was performed every 3 months starting 3 weeks after the end of irradiation. The 3D volume measurement of areas of radiation-induced hepatic injury was performed through incremental dynamic CT images in every follow-up study. CT follow-up study of the patients was done for 12-76 months. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as low attenuation areas on noncontrast CT and enhanced areas on dynamic study in the regions corresponding to the irradiation portals. Of our cases, 67.5% showed the appearance of radiation hepatitis in 3-4 weeks and 95.3% in 3-4 months after the end of irradiation. In both periods, there was a significant delay in the female patients. The time-attenuation curve showed an early and prolonged enhancement of the irradiated regions. The volume reduction pattern of the injured areas was found to be longstanding, exponential, and directed from periphery to the center. CONCLUSION: Early appearance of radiation-induced hepatic injury was found only to be gender dependent, with a tendency to occur with higher irradiated doses; no other parameters affected this phenomenon in our cases. Disappearance of the injured areas, if present, takes a long time (at least 42 months)

A beam penetration of f27 mm would be required to treat 90% of the lesions. We conclude that a machine energy of at least 55 and, preferably, 60 MeV would be necessary for a clinically viable therapy unit for the treatment of choroidal melanomas.

After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

In operable rectal cancer intensive irradiation at a single focal dose of 6.5 Gy and summary dose of 19.5 Gy (3 daily fractions), in operable colonic cancer 4 and 20 Gy (5 daily fractions respectively). The five-year survival rate attained during combined treatment of rectal cancer exceeded that after radical operations by 30%. Fractional-extended irradiation at a single focal dose of 4 Gy and summary dose of 40 Gy (every other day) in 44.6% of the patients permitted one to make locally disseminated rectal cancer resectable. Preoperative irradiation of locally disseminated rectal cancer with a preliminary synchronization of the tumor cell division cycle with 5-fluorouracil (a single focal dose of 6 Gy, summary dose of 36 Gy for irradiation twice a week) was well tolerated by the patients, and its effect on tumors was more noticeable as compared to radiotherapy only. Marked radiation reactions were absent in colonic cancer, radical operation (hemicolectomy) entailed no additional difficulties. Local recurrences were not noted in either of 10 patients who had been followed-up in the course of 1 year

[French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Child, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, France, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prognosis, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: To define prognostic factors for local control and survival in 100 consecutive patients treated by fractionated photon and proton radiation for chordoma of the skull base and upper cervical spine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date	
1	1439	Inverse treatment planning and stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of the tumor and lymph node levels for nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Description of treatment technique, plan comparison, and case study	Algorithms, Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents,Phytogenic/ad [Administration & Dosage], Antineoplastic Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage], Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/ad [Administration & Dosage], Cisplatin/ad [Administration & Dosage], Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Fluorouracil/ad [Administration & Dosage], Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Head, Humans, Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphatic Metastasis/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Risk, Software, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: Inverse treatment planning and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) promise advantages in the treatment of tumors of the head and neck region. Currently published studies use IMRT only in the treatment of the primary tumor. In these studies, the lymph nodes of the neck were treated using conventional techniques. The feasibility of an IMRT technique which allows treatment of the complete target volume, including the primary tumor and lymph nodes, without a beam split is described. PATIENT AND METHOD: For inverse treatment planning, the KonRad planning system was used. The primary as well as the secondary PTV (bilateral lymph node levels) were treated with one intensity-modulated primary plan. To increase the dose in the primary PTV and suspicious lymph nodes, an intensity-modulated boost plan was performed. The "step and shoot" IMRT technique was used. A plan comparison between the described IMRT approach and an IMRT approach using a split-beam technique was performed focusing on the treatment time. A patient with a carcinoma of the nasopharynx was treated with curative intent by a combined radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: The median total dose to the primary PTV was 70 Gy, to suspicious lymph nodes > or = 66.0 Gy, and to the secondary PTV 52 Gy. The defined maximum doses to the organs at risk were not exceeded, and the median dose to the protected parotid gland amounted to 21 Gy. Comparison of the treatment time between both IMRT approaches revealed only a slightly shorter treatment time (1-3 min) for the split-beam IMRT technique without considering the remaining conventional treatment parts of the split-beam IMRT technique. The patient achieved a complete response, and 18 months after treatment no signs of recurrent disease are visible. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT allows the treatment of the target volumes with high doses combined with an excellent sparing of the organs at risk. The IMRT approach presented here makes the treatment of the whole target volume with a single-beam arrangement feasible and does not increase the treatment time compared to a split-beam IMRT technique. Treatment time was comparable to a conventional three-field technique combined with electrons. This IMRT technique can prevent over- or underdosage at field matchlines in the head and neck region and, moreover, is able to spare parotid glands and therefore better avoid xerostomia compared to conventional techniques

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

In our department, between January 1995 to January 2001, we treated eleven patients with mycosis fungoides by total body skin electron irradiation to evaluate its influence. According to our knowledge, our department is the only center in Turkey capable of applying total skin electron beam therapy. Total skin electron beam therapy was applied by using the "translational technique". Daily doses (4 Gray) were given in a total of seven fractions according to the conventional fractionation scheme. There were 6 patients with stage I disease, 3 patients with stage II and 2 patients with stage IV disease. Except stage IV patients, we obtained good cutaneous results. According to our observation, in early stage mycosis fungoides total body skin electron irradiation can provide good cutaneous response, but for stage IV only moderate pallation can be obtained

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities

This report is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred and six patients in stages T2b (B2), T2c (B2), and T3 (C) were treated with 45 Gy photon-beam irradiation to the pelvis and an additional 30 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) to the prostate with 250-MeV protons, yielding a total prostate dose of 75 CGE in 40 fractions. Median follow-up time was 20.2 months (range: 10-30 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system; local control was evaluated by serial digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements. RESULTS: Morbidity evaluation was available on 104 patients. The actuarial 2-year rate of Grade 1 or 2 late morbidity was 12% (8% rectal, 4% urinary). No patients demonstrated Grade 3 or 4 late morbidity. Treatment response was evaluated on 100 patients with elevated pretreatment serum PSA levels. The actuarial 2-year rate of PSA normalization was 96%, 97%, and 63% for pretreatment PSAs of > 4-10, > 10-20, and > 20, respectively. The 13 patients with rising PSA demonstrated local recurrence (3 patients), distant metastasis (8 patients), or no evidence of disease except increasing PSA (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of side effects, despite the tumor dose of 75 CGE, demonstrates that conformal protons can deliver higher doses of radiation to target tissues without increasing complications to surrounding normal tissues. The initial tumor response, as assessed by the high actuarial rate of normalization with pretreatment PSA < or = 20, and the low rate of recurrences within the treatment field (2.8%), are encouraging

We have studied the severe complications occurring after treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. Four groups of patients were compared: Group 1 (80 patients) had treatment with surgery alone for mobile and resectable tumors; Group 2 (23 patients) had treatment with high dose preoperative irradiation followed by surgical resection for tumors which were fixed to adjacent structures and initially unresectable for cure; Group 3 (24 patients, primary disease) and Group 4 (17 patients, locally recurrent disease) had locally advanced tumors as in Group 2 but were treated with IORT after preoperative irradiation and attempted surgical resection. All but 3 complications occurred within one year of therapy. Severe complications were seen in 16% of patients in Group 1, 35% in Group 2, 21% in Group 3 and 47% in Group 4 (32% in Groups 3 and 4 combined). There was a statistically insignificant increase (p = .10) in the complication rate in all irradiated patients (locally advanced tumors) compared to surgery alone (clinically mobile tumors). These data indicate no increase in severe complications with the use of IORT. If the ongoing studies continue to show improved local control with the use of IORT, expanded use of this modality may be warranted

METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery	
0	3780	The 200-MeV proton therapy project at the Paul Scherrer Institute: conceptual design and practical realization	Cyclotrons, Head, Humans, Optics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiography, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Rotation, Switzerland, X-Rays	The new proton therapy facility is being assembled at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The beam delivered by the PSI sector cyclotron can be split and brought into a new hall where it is degraded from 590 MeV down to an energy in the range of 85-270 MeV. A new beam line following the degrader is used to clean the low-energetic beam in phase space and momentum band. The analyzed beam is then injected into a compact isocentric gantry, where it is applied to the patient using a new dynamic treatment modality, the so-called spot-scanning technique. This technique will permit full three-dimensional conformation of the dose to the target volume to be realized in a routine way without the need for individualized patient hardware like collimators and compensators. By combining the scanning of the focused pencil beam within the beam optics of the gantry and by mounting the patient table eccentrically on the gantry, the diameter of the rotating structure has been reduced to only 4 m. In the article the degrees of freedom available on the gantry to apply the beam to the patient (with two rotations for head treatments) are also discussed. The devices for the positioning of the patient on the gantry (x rays and proton radiography) and outside the treatment room (the patient transporter system and the modified mechanics of the computer tomograph unit) are briefly presented. The status of the facility and first experimental results are introduced for later reference

It was shown that especially chronic side effects are benign in most of all cases. Severe - but not vitally dangerous - complications in bladder and intestine are rare (3%); their percentage corresponds roughly to the average mortality rate of surgical intervention (radical prostatectomy). Contrary to operation, troubles of the sexual function appear only in one third of the patients. Taking into consideration the similar therapeutic results of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, radiotherapy is more favorable with respect to side effects. This essential aspect should be considered when making a decision whether to apply a surgical or a radiotherapeutic treatment treatment

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival

Physical aspects of quality control showed two major deviations from the protocol: one center used photon energies of more than 15 MVX without mould; another had a anterior-posterior loading of 3:1. The radiation oncology assessment detected six inadequate treatments: The safety margin was inappropriate in three of 26 mantle fields. Another center used a multiple field technique, and in two patients the paraaortic region was not irradiated

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 3,561 patients who underwent conformal radiation for prostate cancer. Therapy consisted of proton irradiation of the prostate and seminal vesicles and X-ray treatment of the pelvis when warranted. The number of treatments in which the balloon was tolerated was recorded. Results were stratified according to method of irradiation (protons alone vs. combined proton/X-ray) and method of planning (2D vs. 3D planning of X-ray fields in patients undergoing combination treatment). RESULTS: Of all the patients evaluated, 3,474 (97.6%) tolerated the balloon throughout treatment; 87 (2.4%) declined the balloon for 1 or more treatments and tolerated the balloon for 85.5% of their treatments. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant tolerance advantage in those who received protons alone compared with combination treatment (99.5% vs. 95.7%; p < 0.001). In patients undergoing combination treatment, chi-square analysis did not reveal significant tolerance differences in patients undergoing 3D vs. 2D planning for pelvic X-ray fields (95.74% vs. 95.72%; p = 0.990). CONCLUSIONS: Intrarectal balloons are well tolerated over a course of conformal prostate irradiation

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new facility has a synchrotron with maximum energy of 250MeV and two rotational gantries. We treated 105 patients with 120 lesions with proton beams in the first year, beginning in September 2001. The most common lesion treated was primary liver cancer (40 lesions) followed by lung cancer, head and neck cancers, and prostate cancer. Concurrent X-ray radiotherapy was given for 38 of the 120 lesions. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 11 months (range, 1-19 months). Of the 105 patients, 97% had Grade 0-2 RTOG/EORTC acute morbidities, while the remaining 3% had Grade 3. Tumor response after irradiation was CR for 35% of the lesions, PR for 25%, SD for 22%, PD for 9%, and not evaluated for 9%. CONCLUSION: The proton beam therapy conducted at the new facility of the University of Tsukuba was safe and effective

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support continued investigation to confirm therapeutic efficacy

Currently, this information is scattered throughout each of the different treatment and information systems in the oncology department. Furthermore, the lack of organization with standardized methods makes it difficult and time-consuming to navigate through the maze of data, resulting in challenges during patient treatment planning. We present a methodology to develop this electronic patient record (ePR) system based on DICOM standards and perform knowledge-based medical imaging informatics research on specific clinical scenarios where patients are treated with PT. Treatment planning is similar in workflow to traditional radiation therapy (RT) methods such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which utilizes a priori knowledge to drive the treatment plan in an inverse manner. In March 2006, two new RT objects were drafted in a DICOM-RT Supplement 102 specifically for ion therapy, which includes PT. The standardization of DICOM-RT-ION objects and the development of a knowledge base as well as decision-support tools that can be add-on features to the ePR DICOM-RT system were researched. This methodology can be used to extend to PT and the development of future clinical decision-making scenarios during the course of the patient's treatment that utilize "inverse treatment planning." We present the initial steps of this imaging and informatics methodology for PT and lay the foundation for development of future decision-support tools tailored to cancer patients treated with PT. By integrating decision-support knowledge and tools designed to assist in the decision-making process, a new and improved "knowledge-enhanced treatment planning" approach can be realized

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

The use of betatrons after a growth between 1960-1970 decreased progressively from 1975 in favour of linear accelerators (133 in 1989). Cobalt-therapy, rapidly grown up between 1960 and 1980, has reached a plateau phase with a trend to being progressively substituted by low energy linac. The dosimetric aspects are considered: calibration of electron beams, quality control and treatment planning. About 22000 cancer patients were treated in 16 Centres in 1983; of these only 23% (mean value) received electron therapy, but the number varies greatly from one center to another (9-45%). The major indications for electrons in France are: neck nodes, operated breast, internal mammary chain. The general trend is to restrict their use to lesions not deeper than 4-5 cm and first of all to employ them as a boosting treatment, after an X ray irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

Iodine contrast agents (CA), used during computed tomography (CT) imaging, lead to an increase of the Hounsfield units in tissue with increased CA uptake and cause errors in the calculation of the ranges. The aim of this work is to quantify how accurately ion range is calculated in CA loaded tissue. In order to quantify the mean change in Hounsfield units (HU), a statistical analysis of 25 CT data sets with and without CA was performed. To establish a relation between the change in Hounsfield units due to CA and changes in ion range, the Hounsfield number for various CA concentrations and the range of ions in CA was measured. The analysis of CT data sets showed that after intravenous injection of 100 ml contrast agent (Imeron300) at a concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml an increase of the Hounsfield numbers in tumor tissue of up to 57 HU can be observed. The measured range shift in CA is much smaller than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The maximum error in range resulting from the CA enhanced data is approximately 2.5% and results mainly from this wrong interpretation of HU by the TPS. For a tumor with an extent of 5 cm this leads to an exaggeration of the ion ranges during irradiation of (1.24+/-0.04) mm. This may be clinically relevant in cases where highest precision is needed and where organs at risk are close to the target volume. In view of these findings it may be safer to rely solely on native CT data for the purpose of dose and range optimization in therapy planning for heavy ions and protons

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordomas is a challenge. In this study the authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordomas and 10 patients with chondrosarcomas. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact, log rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%. respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordomas) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam therapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively, at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with the worst RFS rates compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively, at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy followed by those with cerebrospinal fluid leakages were the most frequent postoperative complications. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and patient age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam therapy provided better prognoses for these patients

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. RESULTS: The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. CONCLUSION: The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity

Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications

For skull base tumors, 10-year local control rates with combined proton-photon therapy are highest for chondrosarcomas, intermediate for male chordomas, and lowest for female chordomas (94%, 65%, and 42%, respectively). For cervical spine tumors, 10-year local control rates are not significantly different for chordomas and chondrosarcomas (54% and 48%, respectively), nor is there any difference in local control between males and females. Observed treatment-related morbidity has been judged acceptable, in view of the major morbidity and mortality which accompany uncontrolled tumor growth. [References: 46]

Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

Survival rates, patterns of failure and prognostic factors were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients with follicle centre lymphoma stage I and II were treated between 1970 and 1999 in Dresden. Therapy modalities were radiotherapy alone (103 patients) or combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (13 patients). Radiotherapy was applied as involved-field-(IFI)- (104 patients), extended-field- (nine patients) or total-nodal- (three patients) irradiation. Patients received doses between 25 Gy and 50 Gy (median 35 Gy). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were 76% and 51%. Relapse free survival was 62% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up was 4,0 years. Relapses after complete remission were registered in 44 cases. Six patients have had in-field-recurrences. The majority of out-field-recurrences were nodal relapses (50%). 11% of relapses occurred outside of lymph nodes or were disseminated failures (18%). Significant favorable prognostic factors identified by multivariate and univariate analysis were low age (age < 50 years vs. age > 50 years), low stage and performance of bipedal lymphangiography as primary staging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is an effective and tolerable treatment modality for follicle centre lymphoma in the early stages I and II. We registered a high proportion of nodal recurrences, which may be minimized by prophylactic extended radiotherapy	
1	2965	Residual, unresectable, or recurrent colorectal cancer: external beam irradiation and intraoperative electron beam boost +/- resection	Colonic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Colonic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Massachusetts, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate	While combinations of external beam radiation (XRT) and surgery decrease pelvic recurrence and improve survival in the subgroups with residual disease (postop XRT) or initially unresectable disease (preop XRT), local recurrence is still unacceptably high, and survival could be improved. In view of this, pilot studies were instituted at Massachusetts General Hospital in which 32 patients received the standard previous treatment of external beam irradiation and surgery but in addition had an intraoperative electron beam boost of 1000-1500 rad to the remaining tumor or tumor bed. For the 16 patients who presented with unresectable primary lesions, the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy has resulted in a total absence of local recurrence with a minimum 20 month follow-up, and survival rates are statistically better than for the previous group treated with only external beam irradiation and surgical resection. In the group with residual disease, again there have not been any local recurrences in the 7 patients who received all treatment modalities versus 54% and 26% for the group with gross and microscopic residual treated with only external beam techniques. The remaining 9 patients presented with recurrent unresectable lesions--3 are alive (2 NED) at greater than or equal to 3 years

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

The patients were classified as Stage Ib (1 patient), Stage IIa (8 patients), Stage IIb (5 patients), and Stage IVa (5 patients). Treatment resulted in a complete response in 100% (14/14) of patients with Stage Ib, IIa, and IIb disease, and a CR in 60% (3/5) of patients with Stage IVa disease. The Stage Ib and IIa patients had an overall survival of 100% and a disease-free survival of 44% at 6 years. Four of the five patients with Stage IIb CTCL relapsed within 3 months after completing TSEB + TNI with an overall survival in the group of 40% at 5 years. The Stage IVa patients all relapsed within 7 months and died of their disease within 50 months of completing treatment. The acute effects of TSEB + TNI were well tolerated, but three patients developed second malignancy (lung, kidney and skin) and one patient developed myelodysplasia, possibly the result of radiotherapy	
0	4316	A dose response analysis of injury to cranial nerves and/or nuclei following proton beam radiation therapy	Adolescent, Adult, Boston, Brain, Chondroma/ep [Epidemiology], Chondroma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/ep [Epidemiology], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cranial Nerve Injuries, Cranial Nerves/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Neck, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Regression Analysis, Research, Retrospective Studies, Skull Base, Skull Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	The low tolerance of the central nervous system (CNS) limits the radiation dose which can be delivered in the treatment of many patients with brain and head and neck tumors. Although there are many reports concerning the tolerance of the CNS, few have examined individual substructures of the brain and fewer still have had detailed dose information. This study has both. A three dimensional planning system was used to develop the combined proton beam/photon beam treatments for 27 patients with skull-base tumors. The cranial nerves and their related nuclei were delineated on the planning CT scans and the radiation dose to each was determined from three dimensional dose distributions. In the 594 CNS structures (22 structures/patient in 27 patients), there have been 17 structures (in 5 patients) with clinically manifest radiation injury, after a mean follow-up time of 74 months (range 40-110 months). From statistical analyses, dose is found to be a significant predictor of injury. Using logistic regression analysis, we find that, for each cranial nerve, at 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) the complication rate is 1% (0.5-3% with 95% confidence) and that the 5% complication rate occurs at 70 CGE (64-81 CGE with 95% confidence). The slope of the dose response curve (at 50%) is 3.2 (2.2-5.4 with 95% confidence). No significant relationship between dose and latency period for nerve injury was found

METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation

METHODS: Retrospective review of the charts of patients with iris melanoma treated by proton beam therapy between April 1998 and September 2002. Ciliary body melanomas with iris involvement or tumours with extrascleral invasion were excluded. Treatment consisted of 60 Gy of proton beam irradiation delivered in four fractions to the tumour volume. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated, median follow-up of 33 months (8-72 months). 15 patients presented a lesion with documented growth. The median clinical diameter was 5 mm (2-8 mm), the median ultrasound diameter 4.8 mm (2-7.7 mm) The patients were 6% T1, 57.1% T2, and 14.3% T3 all N0M0. The iridocorneal angle was invaded by the tumour in 71.4% of patients. At the end of follow-up, all patients were alive with no proven metastatic disease except one patient with suspicious liver lesions. None of the patients showed tumour progression or ocular relapse. The tumour response at 2 years was a flat lesion for 6.3% of cases, partial regression in 75% and stable in 18.8%. None of the patients required secondary enucleation. The main complication was cataract (45% within 24 months of treatment). Raised intraocular pressure was observed in 15% of patients but no neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy shows potential utility for selected cases of localised iris melanomas allowing excellent local tumour control and eye preservation. Further follow-up on larger series is needed to confirm these results

For intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the "hand calculation" becomes not feasible due to the sophisticated multileaf collimator (MLC) segments created for intensity-modulated dose delivery. Therefore, an independent computerized dose calculation routine is needed for fast and reliable dose verification. In this work, a point dose calculation routine for IMRS/IMRT plan verification is developed by directly applying Clarkson's method. The method includes preparing data table by measuring TPRs for circular fields with diameters ranging 6 to 98 mm, extrapolating TPR for the zero field size (TPR0) from measured data and generating scatter phantom ratio (SPR) for each individual circular field. The segmented MLC sequences created by IMRS/IMRT inverse planning are converted into irregular fields for Clarkson's calculation. This method has been tested using 29 IMRS/IMRT cases. The results indicate that it is reliable, fast, and accurate. The average time to calculate one field is about 2 s with a 300 Mhz CPU

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In prostate cancer it is estimated that annually about 300 patients and in gynaecological cancer about 50 patients, are candidates for proton beam therapy. Owing to major uncertainties, it has not been possible to give an estimate of the number of potential patients with urinary bladder cancer. [References: 61]

High-resolution 3D T2-weighted fast spin echo (3D FSE) MRI scans were obtained for 60 consecutive ocular melanoma patients using a 1.5 T MRI (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), in a standard head coil. These patients were subsequently treated with proton beam therapy at the UC Davis Cyclotron, Davis, CA. The tumor was delineated by placement of tantalum rings (radio-opaque markers) around the tumor periphery as defined by pupillary transillumination during surgery. A point light source, placed against the sclera, was also used to confirm ring agreement with indirect ophthalmoscopy. When necessary, intraoperative ultrasound was also performed. The patients were planned using EYEPLAN software and the tumor volumes were obtained. For analysis, the tumors were divided into four categories based on tumor height and basal diameter. In order to assess the impact of high-resolution 3D T2 FSE MRI, the tumor volumes were outlined on the MRI scans by two independent observers and the tumor volumes calculated for each patient. Six (10%) of 60 patients had tumors, which were not visible on 3D MRI images. These six patients had tumors with tumor heights < or = 3 mm. A small intraobserver variation with a mean of (-0.22 +/- 4)% was seen in tumor volumes delineated by 3D T2 FSE MR images. The ratio of tumor volumes measured on MRI to EYEPLAN for the largest to the smallest tumor volumes varied between 0.993 and 1.02 for 54 patients. The tumor volumes measured directly on 3D T2 FSE MRI ranged from 4.03 to 0.075 cm3. with a mean of 0.87 +/- 0.84 cm3. The tumor shapes obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images were comparable to the tumor shapes obtained using EYEPLAN software. The demonstration of intraocular tumor volumes with the high-resolution 3D fast spin echo T2 weighted MRI is excellent and provides additional information on tumor shape. We found a high degree of accuracy for tumor volumes with direct MRI volumetric measurements in uveal melanoma patients. In some patients with extra large tumors, the tumor base and shape was modified, because of the additional information obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images

Direct particle beam traversal of at least a portion of the lens usually is unavoidable in treatment of posterior intraocular tumors. The precise treatment planned for each patient permits quantitative assessment of the lenticular dose and its radiation quality. We are reporting our preliminary results on the development of helium-ion-induced lens opacifications and cataracts in 54 of these patients who had 10% or less of their lens in the treatment field. We believe these studies will be relevant to estimating the human risk for cataract in space flight

The coordinates of specific target landmarks, i.e., bone, calcium deposition or catheters, on baseline CT scans were compared with those measured on control scans. Since the PLATO-SRS system yields 3 coordinates for each target, the final error is calculated by the evaluation of the shift of the different coordinates. The mean error reported for the first material (ORFIT) was 5 mm (13/23 patients). This margin of error is too high and was considered unacceptable; a second material was then tested. The latter, which is not recyclable and softens at higher temperatures, exhibited a mean error of 2.5 mm (10/23 patients), which allows daily repositioning of greater reliability. Treatment was repeated in 4/20 arcs in all, which number depended mainly on fraction size. Correct lesion location and patient positioning were allowed by laser landmarks on the mask made directly on the treatment couch. The laser too was checked before each treatment session, i.e., preferentially at the end of an ordinary working day

We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy. Further studies should be performed to determine whether TTT could be beneficial to smaller tumours and to define its optimal dose. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel

Conventional MR imaging, however, cannot always depict treatment-induced transient WM abnormalities. We investigated the ability of diffusion-tensor (DT) MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy to detect the treatment-induced transient changes within normal-appearing WM. METHODS: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed in 8 patients treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for brain tumors (17 examinations) and 11 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, fractional anisotropy (FA) value, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio were obtained from 27 hemispheres with normal-appearing WM in the patients. We divided the datasets of isotropic ADC, FA, and NAA/Cr, on the basis of the time period after completion of radiation therapy, into 4 groups: group 1 (0-2 months; n = 10), group 2 (3-5 months; n = 5), group 3 (6-9 months; n = 7), and group 4 (10-12 months; n = 5). We compared averages of mean isotropic ADC, mean FA, and NAA/Cr of each patient group with those of the control group by using a t test. RESULTS: In the group 2, averages of mean FA and NAA/Cr decreased and average of mean isotopic ADC increased in comparison with those of the control group (P = .004, .04, and .0085, respectively). There were no significant differences in the averages between the control group and patient groups 1, 3, and 4. CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy can provide quantitative indices that may reflect treatment-induced transient derangement of normal-appearing WM

Both conventional and storage phosphor methods yielded projection radiographs in which anatomy of the irradiated and surrounding tissue was demonstrated. Exposed phantoms were used to confirm that the images represent a true projection of the radiation field. A preliminary series of 22 cases was evaluated by two radiotherapists and judged subjectively to be of clinical value. Geometric error, or more importantly, the lack thereof, during high-energy electron treatments was easily confirmed with this method. In three cases, the treatment protocol was corrected based on the images obtained. Because the readout process of storage phosphor images allows for gain adjustments and post-processing, the images obtained with this method were found to delineate anatomy in the treated and surrounding tissues somewhat more consistently than could conventional images

The first series of patients include 37 with lesions in the brain, 5 in the thorax and 28 in the abdomen. The main advantages of NMR-CT are as follows: No ionizing irradiation exists. Sagittal and frontal tomograms are easily produced. Chemical status of tissue is shown by relaxation times (T1, T2) and proton density.

It included irradiation of the bed of tumor removed. Fast electron beam was produced by a small betatron (collimator size--5 x 6 cm and 8 x 12 cm) installed in the operating room. Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained

Due to the finite range and the sharpness of the dose gradients, the dose to well defined target volumes can be raised without excessive irradiation of non-target tissue. The prescribed proton doses are determined in part on the basis of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the particular radiation quality. In this study, RBE values were determined for a proton beam with a maximal range of 33 mm, which corresponds to an energy of approximately 67 MeV. The range modulated depth-dose distribution, with a 20 mm extended Bragg peak, was mainly designed for high precision treatment of small targets such as uveal melanomas. The tested cell lines, LS-174T and V79-379A, were chosen because of their suitability for clonogenic assays. The cells were irradiated with single doses in the range 2-10 Gy at different depths in the extended peak region of the range modulated proton beam. RBE values were determined by comparing the doses needed to obtain the same reduction in colony formation (0.5, 0.1 and 0.01) as with the reference 60Co gamma source. The mean RBE value was 1.22 with a standard deviation of 0.08. The variations depended on both cell type and on the survival levels considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The theoretical considerations about the clinical advantages this treatment modality can yield and the results obtained at the centers where it has already been used justify the proposal to project a center of this kind also in our Country. To this purpose, two of the authors of this paper (U. Amaldi, G. Tosi) founded the TERA Group formed by physicists, engineers and radiotherapists who work in close collaboration on a feasibility study for a hadrontherapy facility. The first aim of the Hadrontherapy Project is to design a center equipped with a synchrotron which, at the beginning, will accelerate negative hydrogen ions (H-) which will first produce 70-250 MeV proton beams and, then accelerate light ions (up to 16O) to 430 MeV/amu. This accelerator will serve four or five treatment rooms where patients can be irradiated simultaneously. Two rooms will be equipped with a fixed horizontal beam for the treatment of eye, head and neck tumors; the others will be equipped with rotating gantries to administer, in any clinical situation, really adequate treatment. Such a unit, when enough experience is fained, will allow at least 1000 patients to be treated yearly. The synchrotron injector will be designed so as to allow, parallel to the radiotherapy activities, other applications of medical and biological interest such as: the production of radioisotopes for diagnostic use (especially positron emitters), the analysis of trace elements through the PIXE technique and the production of thermal and epithermal neutrons for boron neutron capture therapy.

Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

Although there are many reports concerning the tolerance of the CNS, few have examined individual substructures of the brain and fewer still have had detailed dose information. This study has both. A three dimensional planning system was used to develop the combined proton beam/photon beam treatments for 27 patients with skull-base tumors. The cranial nerves and their related nuclei were delineated on the planning CT scans and the radiation dose to each was determined from three dimensional dose distributions. In the 594 CNS structures (22 structures/patient in 27 patients), there have been 17 structures (in 5 patients) with clinically manifest radiation injury, after a mean follow-up time of 74 months (range 40-110 months). From statistical analyses, dose is found to be a significant predictor of injury. Using logistic regression analysis, we find that, for each cranial nerve, at 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) the complication rate is 1% (0.5-3% with 95% confidence) and that the 5% complication rate occurs at 70 CGE (64-81 CGE with 95% confidence). The slope of the dose response curve (at 50%) is 3.2 (2.2-5.4 with 95% confidence). No significant relationship between dose and latency period for nerve injury was found

Cytogenetic aberrations, growth alterations, responses to a second irradiation, and mutant frequencies at the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and thymidine kinase loci were determined. A greater percentage of clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles exhibited instability (defined as clones showing one or more outlying characteristics) than in the case of those that survived gamma irradiation. The phenotypes of the unstable clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles were also qualitatively different from those of the clones that survived gamma irradiation. A greater percentage (20%) of the unstable clones that survived gamma irradiation than those that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles (4%) showed an altered response to the second irradiation, while an increase in the percentage of clones that had an outlying frequency of ouabain-resistant and thymidine kinase mutants was more evident in the clones exposed to (56)Fe particles than in those exposed to gamma rays. Growth alterations and increases in dicentric chromosomes were found only in clones with more than one alteration. These results underscore the complex nature of genomic instability and the likelihood that radiation-induced genomic instability arises from different original events

METHODS: The literature was reviewed regarding recent research in the therapy of lung cancer. Emphasis was placed on newer radiation therapy (RT) techniques. RESULTS: Advances in physics and computer technology have improved radiation delivery systems. New strategies have been used, such as altered fractionation patterns, three-dimensional treatment planning, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), tomotherapy, stereotactic RT, and heavy ion RT. New technologies will make it possible to administer higher doses more precisely, which should result in better disease control, with less toxicity. CONCLUSION: Further research will improve the outcome of patients with lung cancer by providing more effective tools for the RT of this disease. [References: 41]

Results of the first 42 treated tumors in 31 patients are presented. Most of the patients had solitary tumors in liver, lung or retroperitoneal space. Clinical target volumes ranged from 2 to 622 cm3 (mean 78 cm3) and minimum doses to the planning target volumes (PTV) of 7.7-30 Gy/fraction (mean 14.2 Gy) were given on 1-4 occasions to a total minimum dose to the PTVs of 7.7-45 Gy (mean 30.2 Gy) to the periphery of the PTV and total mean doses to the PTVs of 8-66 Gy (mean 41 Gy). The central part of the tumor was usually given about 50% higher dose compared to that of the periphery of the PTV by a planned inhomogeneous dose distribution. Some of the patients received stereotactic radiation therapy concomitantly to more than one target, in others new metastases were also treated which appeared during the follow-up period. We observed a local rate of no progressive disease of 80% during a follow-up period of 1.5-38 months. Fifty percent of the tumors decreased in size or disappeared

Over 500 patients have now been treated. We have had very good results to date in treating patients with small tumors critically located near a radiation-sensitive organ which would preclude delivering a curative dose with conventional radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients with larger tumors where the tumor dose cannot be increased more than 10% over conventional radiotherapy have not responded well to helium ion radiotherapy. This is illustrated by discussing selected patient groups in detail, namely those with uveal melanoma, small, low-grade tumors near the central nervous system, carcinoma of the pancreas, and carcinoma of the esophagus

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose-volume histograms were compared between photon, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton plans at doses of 66 Gy, 87.5 Gy in Stage I (n=10) and 60-63 Gy, and 74 Gy in Stage III (n=15). RESULTS: For Stage I, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 31.8%, 24.6%, and 15.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 66 Gy, whereas they were 13.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, with proton with dose escalation to 87.5 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (p=0.002). For Stage III, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 54.1%, 46.9%, and 34.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 63 Gy, whereas they were 39.7%, 36.6%, and 31.6%, respectively, for proton with dose escalation to 74 CGE (p=0.002). In all cases, the doses to lung, spinal cord, heart, esophagus, and integral dose were lower with proton therapy even compared with IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation, compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT

This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy

The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury

Because lupus erythematosus tumidus (LET) has rarely been documented in the literature and is often difficult to differentiate from other photodermatoses such as polymorphous light eruption, we performed photoprovocation tests in 60 patients with LET according to a standardized protocol. Areas of uninvolved skin on the upper back were irradiated with single doses of UV-A (100 J/cm2) and/or UV-B (1.5 minimal erythema dose) daily for three consecutive days. Interestingly, patients with LET are more photosensitive than those with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and in our study experimental phototesting revealed characteristic skin lesions in 43 patients (72%). Because of the latency period in developing positive phototest reactions, it might be difficult for these patients to link sun exposure with their skin lesions. Furthermore, our data revealed a positive correlation of antinuclear antibodies and positive provocative phototest reactions in these patients as seen for other forms of LE. In conclusion, the high incidence of positive phototest reactions in correlation with the clinical findings, history of photosensitivity and antinuclear antibodies enable the classification of LET as the most photosensitive type of LE

0	2200	The role of proton therapy in the treatment of large irradiation volumes: a comparative planning study of pancreatic and biliary tumors.[see comment]	Algorithms, Bile Duct Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Bile Duct Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Italy, Kidney, Liver, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Staging, Pancreatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Time, Universities, Vascular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Vascular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vena Cava,Inferior	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefit of proton therapy for abdominal tumors. Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues

The tumor mass usually surrounds the spinal cord and infiltrates vertebral bone. A combined technique using protons or electrons to boost the initial photon fields is generally applied. We evaluated the use of dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy as an alternative technique for treating advanced cervical chordoma. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A female patient with incomplete resection of a vertebral chordoma surrounding C2-C3 was irradiated with a total dose of 58 Gy (ICRU point) in 2 Gy daily fractions for 29 days between December 2001 and January 2002. Beam arrangement consisted of seven 6 MV non-opposed coplanar fields. Pretreatment quality assurance included checking of the absolute dose at reference points and 2D dose map analysis. Treatment was delivered with a 120-leaf collimator in sliding window mode. To verify the daily setup, portal images at 0 degrees and 90 degrees were compared with the simulation images before treatment delivery (manual matching) and after treatment delivery (automatic anatomy matching). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The mean dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 57.6 +/- 2.1 Gy covering 95% of the PTV per 95% isodose. The minimum dose to the PTV (D99) was 53.6 Gy in the overlapping area between the PTV and the spinal cord planning organ at risk volume (PRV). The maximum dose to the spinal cord was 42.2 Gy and to the spinal cord PRV (8 mm margin) 53.7 Gy. The mean dose to the parotid glands was 37.4 Gy (homolateral gland) and 19.5 Gy (contralateral gland). Average deviation in setup was -1.1 +/- 2.5 mm (anterior-posterior), 2.4 +/- 1.3 mm (latero-lateral), 0.7 +/- 0.9 mm (craniocaudal) and -0.43 +/- 1 degree (rotation). CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of chordomas surrounding the spinal cord, intensity-modulated radiotherapy can provide high dose homogeneity and PTV coverage. Frequent digital portal image-based setup control is able to reduce random positioning errors for head and neck cancer patients immobilized with conventional thermoplastic masks

In all cases the diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory data, as well as radiographic images. Ten patients with false-negative CT scans had MRI confirming the presence of microadenomas less than 5 mm in size. The majority of patients (n = 51) were operated via transsphenoidal approach, transcranial route was utilized in 2 cases. Among the pathological findings, corticotropinomas were revealed in 49 cases, 4 patients were considered to have hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary without well demarcated adenoma. All patients were divided into 2 groups based on the history of previous treatment. Group 1 included 37 primary patients who had not been treated before admission. Group 2 included 16 patients treated surgically (e.g. neurosurgical operations, bilateral/unilateral adrenalectomy), or with irradiation therapy, including proton beam irradiation prior to admission. We came to conclusion that the following principles were essential in the management of Cushing's disease. 1. Properly interpreted clinical signs and symptoms along with biochemical data and radiographic imaging (including MRI) are extremely helpful in the preoperative evaluation of such patients. Our approach helped us reveal corticotropinomas with 98% accuracy. 2. Microsurgical removal was proved to be effective in up to 83% of patients, which was demonstrated by clinical and biochemical remission. 3. It should be emphasized that the results of treatment were significantly better in the first group versus the second one. In group 1, remission was reached in 91.1% of patients as compared to 62.5% in Group 2. 4. In primary patients, the trauma associated with surgical procedure is less and tumors demonstrate a less aggressive biological behavior

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR AMS. since 1983 using the synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. A "piercing" method with a proton beam of 12 mm in diameter (in one case 10 mm) was employed. Nine patients had unilateral anastomoses with the blood supply from branches of the internal and/or external carotid arteries, and one patient had a bilateral anastomosis. Irradiation was given in 2 fractions, in 2-3 days, the maximum total dose was 50-60 Gy. Regression of ophthalmological symptoms was noted 2-3 months after irradiation. Convalescence was noted in 8 patients, a follow-up period in 2 patients was insufficient. Of 7 patients examined by angiography complete thrombosis of the anastomosis was noted in 4, considerable reduction of the blood flow was noted in 3

Six patients had positron emission tomography 15 to 25 minutes after radiation therapy with a 42 MeV accelerator. Five patients had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and one required therapy for a carcinoma of the common bile duct. We sought to determine whether state-of-the-art PET technology could be used to monitor the three-dimensional activity distribution of radiation-induced radioactivity. At the time of the examination all six patients had sufficient concentrations of C-11 and N-13 activity in the irradiated volume to permit the evaluation of the activity distribution. We found significant activity at the body surface, which permitted field delineation. We conclude that the in vivo generated radioactivity can be monitored with PET	
0	2420	Current developments in proton therapy: a review. [Review] [85 refs]	Engineering, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiobiology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The use of high-energy protons in radiotherapy was first proposed in 1946. In the last decade there has been a significant growth in the number of centres using protons in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disease. To date (January 1993) a total of more than 11,500 patients have been treated world-wide. Encouraging clinical results have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this article is to outline the advantages of proton beams and to review current developments in physics and engineering applied to the field of proton therapy with particular emphasis on proton accelerator technology and the development of proton therapy facilities. The production of clinically useful beams is discussed and the relative merits of different treatment systems compared. Reference is also made to the factors affecting the absorbed dose in a patient and to proton radiobiology together with the results of studies of comparisons of treatment planning with protons with that using conventional photon therapy. The dosimetry of proton beams is also reviewed. [References: 85]

Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another

METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery

METHODS: 30 enucleated eyes were included for histopathological study and Ki-67 immunostaining. Patients were enucleated between 1991 and 1996 for uveal melanoma, 14 after proton beam irradiation and 16 without treatment (control group). The mean follow up period was 2.5 years after diagnosis and 1 year after enucleation. RESULTS: A significant relation was found between Ki-67 score and mitotic index (r = 0.56, p = 0.001), histological largest tumour diameter (r = 0.38, p = 0. 03), fibrosis (r = -0.35, p = 0.05), absence of tumoral pigmentation (p = 0.05), and presence of vascular thrombosis (p = 0.03). The Ki-67 score was significantly higher in the non-irradiated group (p = 0.01) and in the group of patients whose cause of enucleation was tumoral evolution (p = 0.005) compared with the group of patients enucleated after neovascular glaucoma. The Ki-67 score was very high in a case of orbital recurrence of uveal melanoma and metastatic death. 70% of metastasised tumours showed a Ki-67 score higher than the median value. CONCLUSION: Ki-67 labelling is a reliable method of estimating the proliferative activity in uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation. The Ki-67 score is significantly correlated with prognostic variables (mitotic index and histological largest tumour diameter), and with radiation effects after proton beam irradiation

This inhomogeneous spatial distribution of lesions can be visualized indirectly and rapidly in the form of radiation-induced foci using immunocytochemical detection or GFP-tagged DNA repair proteins. To analyze faster protein translocations and a possible contribution of radiation-induced chromatin movement in DNA damage recognition in live cells, we developed a remote-controlled system to obtain high-resolution fluorescence images of living cells during ion irradiation with a frame rate of the order of seconds. Using scratch replication labeling, only minor chromatin movement at sites of ion traversal was observed within the first few minutes of impact. Furthermore, time-lapse images of the GFP-coupled DNA repair protein aprataxin revealed accumulations within seconds at sites of ion hits, indicating a very fast recruitment to damaged sites. Repositioning of the irradiated cells after fixation allowed the comparison of live cell observation with immunocytochemical staining and retrospective etching of ion tracks. These results demonstrate that heavy-ion radiation-induced changes in subnuclear structures can be used to determine the kinetics of early protein recruitment in living cells and that the changes are not dependent on large-scale chromatin movement at short times postirradiation

The output timing signal from the system is transferred to the proton accelerator for synchronized irradiation. The timing signal is set during the expiratory phase at a duration of 1.5 to 2 seconds. The efficacy of this method was evaluated by dose volume histogram based on the treatment planning program with CT images. The volume spared by this novel method was calculated in several cases, and results suggest that the method was highly effective

To assess the possibility that risks from radionuclide exposures may be underestimated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Risk estimates following internal exposures can be made for a small number of alpha-particle-emitting nuclides. (1) Lung cancer in underground miners exposed by inhalation to radon-222 gas and its short-lived progeny. Studies of residential (222)Rn exposure are generally consistent with predictions from the miner studies. (2) Liver cancer and leukaemia in patients given intravascular injections of Thorotrast, a thorium-232 oxide preparation that concentrates in liver, spleen and bone marrow. (3) Bone cancer in patients given injections of radium-224, and in workers exposed occupationally to (226)Ra and (228)Ra, mainly by ingestion. (4) Lung cancer in Mayak workers exposed to plutonium-239, mainly by inhalation. Liver and bone cancers were also seen, but the dosimetry is not yet sufficiently good enough to provide quantitative estimates of risks. Comparisons can be made between risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer derived for radionuclide exposure and those derived for the A-bomb survivors, exposed mainly to low-LET (linear energy transfer) external radiation. Data from animal studies, using dogs and rodents, allow comparisons of cancer induction by a range of alpha- and beta-/gamma-emitting radionuclides. They provide information on relative biological effectiveness (RBE), dose-response relationships, dose-rate effects and the location of target cells for different malignancies. RESULTS: For lung and liver cancer, the estimated values of risk per Sv for internal exposure, assuming an RBE for alpha-particles of 20, are reasonably consistent with estimates for external exposure to low-LET radiation. This also applies to bone cancer when risk is calculated on the basis of average bone dose, but consideration of dose to target cells on bone surfaces suggests a low RBE for alpha-particles. Similarly, for leukaemia, the comparison of risks from alpha-irradiation ((232)Th and progeny) and external radiation suggest a low alpha RBE; this conclusion is supported by animal data. Risk estimates for internal exposure are dependent on the assumptions made in calculating dose. Account is taken of the distribution of radionuclides within tissues and the distribution of target cells for cancer induction. For the lungs and liver, the available human and animal data provide support for current assumptions. However, for bone cancer and leukaemia, it may be that changes are required. Bone cancer risk may be best assessed by calculating dose to a 50 micro m layer of marrow adjacent to endosteal (inner) bone surfaces rather than to a single 10 micro m cell layer as currently assumed. Target cells for leukaemia may be concentrated towards the centre of marrow cavities so that the risk of leukaemia from bone-seeking radionuclides, particularly alpha emitters, may be overestimated by the current assumption of uniform distribution of target cells throughout red bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime risk estimates considered here for exposure to internally deposited radionuclides and to external radiation are subject to uncertainties, arising from the dosimetric assumptions made, from the quality of cancer incidence and mortality data and from aspects of risk modelling; including variations in baseline rates between populations for some cancer types. Bearing in mind such uncertainties, comparisons of risk estimates for internal emitters and external radiation show good agreement for lung and liver cancers. For leukaemia, the available data suggest that the assumption of an alpha-particle RBE of 20 can result in overestimates of risk. For bone cancer, it also appears that current assumptions will overestimate risks from alpha-particle-emitting nuclides, particularly at low doses. [References: 94]

PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: In 41 patients irradiated for unilateral breast cancer the regular scoring by CTC was done during radiotherapy. In parallel, a total of 4,920 spectrophotometric measurements to determine the skin color were performed at baseline, at the beginning of radiotherapy, and at 20, 40 and 60 Gy. The nonirradiated contralateral breast was used for control measurements. RESULTS: As expected, the skin color (especially red) depended on the radiation dose applied to the skin. The objective spectrophotometric measurements were found to correlate well with the subjective CTC scores. CONCLUSION: For classification of acute radiation toxicity there seems to be no need to replace the common CTC scoring by technical methods

To achieve this goal, tighter treatment margins are needed, which require more accurate delineation of the prostate target and normal tissue at the time of treatment planning and before actual daily treatments. Modem radiation therapy techniques can deposit conformal dose virtually anywhere in the body; however, this precise therapy is of no value if it is not accurately hitting the target. Whether dose escalation is achieved by external beam techniques (eg, IMRT, protons) or brachytherapy, these ba-sic planning and delivery considerations are essentially the same. Future directions in prostate radiation therapy will use even higher radiation doses,alternative fractionation patterns, intraprostatic targets (eg, prostate tumor seen on MRI), and improved patient selection regarding which patients will benefit the most from these advanced techniques.

Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae.

[Russian]	Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Male, Methods, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	The paper is devoted to the description of methods of topometric preparation of 73 prostatic cancer patients for gamma-and proton-beam irradiation using an x-ray simulator and a CT tomograph. Basing on the measurement of the prostate in 3 directions in patients with different stages of disease (T1-2-24, T3-29 and T4-20), a conclusion was made that a prostate size was not enough to determine a stage of disease though a tendency to an increase in prostate size corresponded to the growing T index. However, stages T1-2 and T4 could be determined for sure within a certain range of prostate size values

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was sent to 198 German radiotherapy institutions. Data about patient characteristics, stage of disease, practice and fractionation of radiotherapy, outcome of therapy, etc. were systematically evaluated. 123 of 198 institutions answered the complete questionnaire (62.1%). RESULTS: Only 23 of the 123 institutions (18.7%) reported experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of adults. 18 institutions with 98 patients were evaluable. The majority of patients (72 of 98) was treated on a linear accelerator. The median single dose of radiotherapy was 2 Gy, while the median total dose was 24 Gy. 81 of 89 evaluable patients (91%) reached a local control of the treated lesion(s), 69 of those had a complete remission. Eight of 89 patients (9%) developed an in-field recurrence. 87.8% of patients experienced no acute and 97% of patients no late side effects of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis in adults in Germany is still very limited. Nevertheless, the clinical results-with high remission and local control rates-confirm the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the multidisciplinary treatment of this disease. Due to the small number of patients in this study despite higher incidence rates, the knowledge of this disease has to be multiplied in Germany. Future patients should be systematically included into a prospective radiotherapy registry

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1989, 84 evaluable patients were treated. PR patients (n = 45) were planned/localized on the basis of biplane angiography and treated between 1989 and 2000. BL patients (n = 39) were planned/localized on the basis of CT/MRI and treated since 2000. Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival, nidus obliteration (NO), and any radiographic improvement were undertaken with Cox regression of dose and volume effects. RESULTS: No significant complication, survival, previous embolization incidence, AVM location or size differences existed between BL/PR patients. The groups differed significantly in prescribed dose (PR: 16.2 Gy, BL: 17.3 Gy, p = 0.004) and isodose (PR: 62%, BL: 79%, p < 0.0001). Estimated 2-year NO rate was 87% for BL patients, 12% for PR patients (p < 0.0001). Ultimate PR NO rate was 67% at 6 years. Dose (p = 0.037) and isodose (p = 0.014) significantly affected PR NO outcome; volume was of borderline significance (p = 0.069). No factors significantly affected BL outcome. Analyses of small (< or = 4.0 cm3), high-dose (> or = 17.0 Gy) PR patients (PR1 group) vs. BL patients still demonstrated greater NO (p = 0.04) and radiographic improvement (p = 0.0004) rates for the BL group. PR1 patients had a 76% 3-year NO rate. CONCLUSIONS: BL-based radiosurgery achieved a high NO rate, the PR method did not. Differences in outcomes between PR/BL groups may be due to localization methods or an inherent advantage with the BL system. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel

BNCT involves the irradiation of cancer patients by a beam of neutrons, with an energy range of predominantly 1 eV to 10 keV. The patient is infused with a tumor-seeking, (10)B-loaded compound prior to irradiation. Neutron capture in the (10)B atoms results in a high local radiation dose to the tumor cells, whilst sparing the healthy tissue. Neutron capture, however, also occurs in other atoms naturally present in tissue, sometimes resulting in radionuclides that will be present after treatment. The patient is therefore, following BNCT, radioactive. The importance of this induced activity with respect to the absorbed dose in the patient as well as to the radiation exposure of the staff has been investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As a standard radiation protection procedure, the ambient dose equivalent rate was measured on all patients following BNCT using a dose ratemeter. Furthermore, some of the patients underwent measurements using a gamma-ray spectrometer to identify which elements and confirm which isotopes are activated. RESULTS: Peak levels, i.e., at contact and directly after irradiation, are of the order of 40-60 muSv/h, falling to < 10 muSv/h 30-50 min after treatment. The average ambient dose equivalent in the first 2 h at a distance of 2 m from the patient is in the order of 2.5 muSv. The ambient dose equivalent rate in 2 m distance from the patient's head at the earliest time of leaving the reactor center (20 min after the end of treatment) is far less than 1 muSv/h. The main radioisotopes were identified as (38)Cl, (49)Ca, and (24)Na. Furthermore, in two patients, the isotopes (198)Au and (116m)In were also present. The initial activity is predominantly due to (49)Ca, whilst the remaining activity is predominantly due to (24)Na. CONCLUSION: The absorbed dose resulting from the activated isotopes in the irradiated volume is in the order of < 1% of the prescribed dose and therefore does not add a significant contribution to the absorbed dose in the target volume. In other parts of the patient's body, the absorbed dose by induced activity is magnitudes smaller and can be neglected. The levels of radiation received by staff members and non-radiation workers (i.e., accompanying persons) are well below the recommended limits	
1	2912	Current results of proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	Proton beam irradiation has been used for the treatment of 241 uveal melanomas over the past 7 1/2 years. Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

A beam penetration of f27 mm would be required to treat 90% of the lesions. We conclude that a machine energy of at least 55 and, preferably, 60 MeV would be necessary for a clinically viable therapy unit for the treatment of choroidal melanomas. An extracted beam current of 10(-9) A would be more than sufficient

It is associated with an increased risk of malignancy including intracranial chondrosarcomas. Early diagnosis is crucial; screening patients with Ollier's disease is recommended. The treatment of choice for these intracranial cartilaginous tumours is complete surgical excision but this is often difficult to achieve due to difficult access and relationships with neurovascular structures. An alternative treatment is proton-beam therapy. We report a case of Maffucci's syndrome; illustrating the typical clinical and radiological features as well as the known complications of the condition. [References: 18]

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

This paper will discuss proton treatment in general, treatment planning procedures, and results to date in major patient categories. 846 patients have been treated with fractionated proton therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron, with normal tissue and tumor responses consistent with an RBE of 1.1 for the proton beam. Proton beam therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with uveal melanomas, and chordomas and chondrosarcomas involving the skull base and cervical spine. Improved dose distribution possible with protons have allowed greater doses than are given conventionally to be delivered to patients with prostatic carcinoma, head and neck malignancies, ano-rectal cancers, and retroperitoneal tumors. Doses employed have been usually 10 to 20% greater than normally would be delivered in our department to such tumors. Generally, local control rates have been good

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 394 1H MR spectra were acquired from 100 patients (age 19-74 years; mean and median age, 43 years) before and during 2 years after radiation therapy (the mean absorbed doses calculated for the averaged spectroscopy voxels are similar and close to 20 Gy). RESULTS: Oscillations were observed in choline-containing compounds (Cho)/creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and center of gravity (CG) of the lipid band in the range of 0.7-1.5 ppm changes over time reveal oscillations. The parameters have the same 8-month cycle period; however the CG changes precede the other by 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the oscillative nature of the brain response to irradiation, which may be caused by the blood-brain barrier disruption and repair processes. These oscillations may influence the NMR results, depending on the cycle phase in which the NMR measurements are performed in. The earliest manifestation of radiation injury detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the CG shift

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function

Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

Patient-related, disease-related, and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991. Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19 children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36 children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size, or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients	
0	1760	Intensity modulated proton therapy: a clinical example	Adult, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Heart, Humans, Lung, Male, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sensitivity and Specificity, Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Switzerland, Thoracic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Thoracic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Video Recording, Water	In this paper, we report on the clinical application of fully automated three-dimensional intensity modulated proton therapy, as applied to a 34-year-old patient presenting with a thoracic chordoma. Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

A five-field 18 MV photon treatment plan, selected to minimize lung dose, is compared with helium ions using the same field configuration. Dose volume histograms show target coverage, as well as dose delivered to critical structures lung, heart, mediastinum, and spinal cord. Although both helium ions and photons deliver approximately the same lung dose for this treatment plan, radiation to the heart and spinal cord from this field arrangement is significantly reduced with the helium ion beam. The concentration of dose at the tumor site, while sparing surrounding normal tissue, is characteristic of charged particle therapy, particularly with light ions, which includes particles with Z from that of protons (Z = 1) through that of neon (Z = 10)	
0	2006	Evaluation of polymer gels and MRI as a 3-D dosimeter for intensity-modulated radiation therapy	Biophysics, Calibration, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Film Dosimetry, Gels, Germany, Glass, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Polymers, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Time	BANG gel (MGS Research, Inc., Guilford, CT) has been evaluated for measuring intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose distributions. Treatment plans with target doses of 1500 cGy were generated by the Peacock IMRT system (NOMOS Corp., Sewickley, PA) using test target volumes. The gels were enclosed in 13 cm outer diameter cylindrical glass vessels. Dose calibration was conducted using seven smaller (4 cm diameter) cylindrical glass vessels irradiated to 0-1800 cGy in 300 cGy increments. Three-dimensional maps of the proton relaxation rate R2 were obtained using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) and correlated with dose. A Hahn spin echo sequence was used with TR = 3 s, TE = 20 and 100 ms, NEX = 1, using 1 x 1 x 3 mm3 voxels. The MRI measurements were repeated weekly to identify the gel-aging characteristics. Ionization chamber, thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD), and film dosimetry measurements of the IMRT dose distributions were obtained to compare against the gel results. The other dosimeters were used in a phantom with the same external cross-section as the gel phantom. The irradiated R2 values of the large vessels did not precisely track the smaller vessels, so the ionization chamber measurements were used to normalize the gel dose distributions. The point-to-point standard deviation of the gel dose measurements was 7.0 cGy. When compared with the ionization chamber measurements averaged over the chamber volume, 1% agreement was obtained. Comparisons against radiographic film dose distribution measurements and the treatment planning dose distribution calculation were used to determine the spatial localization accuracy of the gel and MRI. Spatial localization was better than 2 mm, and the dose was accurately determined by the gel both within and outside the target. The TLD chips were placed throughout the phantom to determine gel measurement precision in high- and low-dose regions. A multidimensional dose comparison tool that simultaneously examines the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement was used to evaluate the gel in both low-and high-dose gradient regions. When 3% and 3 mm criteria were used for the comparisons, more than 90% of the TLD measurements agreed with the gel, with the worst of 309 TLD chip measurements disagreeing by 40% of the criteria. All four MRI measurement session gel-measured dose distributions were compared to evaluate the time behavior of the gel. The low-dose regions were evaluated by comparison with TLD measurements at selected points, while high-dose regions were evaluated by directly comparing measured dose distributions. Tests using the multidimensional comparison tool showed detectable degradation beyond one week postirradiation, but all low-dose measurements passed relative to the test criteria and the dose distributions showed few regions that failed	
1	675	Proton beam radiotherapy versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: A comparative study	Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Germany, Humans, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study was undertaken between proton and photon therapy in uveal melanoma to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. A fixed proton horizontal beam (OPTIS) and intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT), with multiple noncoplanar beam arrangements, was compared with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), using a static and a dynamic micromultileaf collimator and intensity-modulated RT (IMRS). METHOD AND MATERIALS: A planning CT scan was performed on a brain metastasis patient, with a 3-mm acquisition slice spacing and the patient looking at a luminous spot with the eyes in three different positions (neutral and 25 degrees right and left). Four different gross tumor volumes were defined for each treatment technique. These target scenarios represented different locations (involving vs. not involving the macula and temporal vs. nasal) and volumes (10 x 6 mm vs. 16 x 10 mm) to challenge the proton and photon treatment techniques. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 2 mm laterally and 3 mm craniocaudally for both modalities. A dose homogeneity of 95-99% of the planning target volume was used as the "goal" for all techniques. The dose constraint (maximum) for the organs at risk (OARs) for both the proton and the SRT photon plans was 27.5, 22.5, 20, and 9 CGE-Gy for the optic apparatus, retina, lacrimal gland, and lens, respectively. The dose to the planning target volume was 50 CGE-Gy in 10 CGE-Gy daily fractions. The plans for proton and photon therapy were computed using the Paul Scherrer Institute and BrainSCAN, version 5.2 (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) treatment planning systems, respectively. Tumor and OARs dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using the dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index (CI(95%)), and inhomogeneity coefficient. RESULTS: Target coverage of all simulated uveal melanomas was equally conformal with the photon and proton modalities. The median CI(95%) value was 1.74, 1.86, and 1.83 for the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively. With proton planning, the median CI(95%) was 1.88 for OPTIS and substantially improved with IMPT in some tumor cases (median CI(95%), 1.29). The tumor dose homogeneity in the proton plans was, however, always better than with SRT photon planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient 0.1 and 0.15 vs. 0.46, 0.41, and 0.23 for the OPTIS and IMPT vs. the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively). Compared with the photon plans, the use of protons did not lead to a substantial reduction in the homolateral OAR total integral dose in the low- to high-dose level, except for the lacrimal gland. The median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume with the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans was 33-30.8, 31.8-28, and 35.8-49 Gy, respectively, for the lacrimal gland, a critical organ. For protons, only the OPTIS plans were better, with a median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume using OPTIS and IMPT of 19.2 and 8.8 and 25.6 and 23.6 CGE, respectively. The contralateral OARs were completely spared with the proton plans, but the median dose delivered to these structures was 1.2 Gy (range, 0-6.3 Gy) with the SRT photon plans. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of SRT photon techniques, compared with protons, can result in similar levels of dose conformation. IMPT did not increase the degree of conformality for this small tumor. Tumor dose inhomogeneity was, however, always increased with photon planning. Except for the lacrimal gland, the use of protons, with or without intensity modulation, did not increase homolateral OAR dose sparing. The dose to all the contralateral OARs was, however, completely eliminated with proton planning

The investigated parameters were leaf width in the MLC, leaf transmission, related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. Seven head-and-neck patients with stage T1-T3N0-N2cM0 oropharyngeal cancer were studied. For each patient nine plans were made with a different set of linac/MLC parameters. The plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) v7.6c and PLATO RTS v2.6.4, ITP v1.1.8. A hypothetical ideal linac/MLC was introduced to investigate the influence of one parameter at a time without interaction of other parameters. When any of the three parameters was increased from the ideal set-up values (leaf width 2.5 mm, transmission 0%, penumbra 3 mm), the mean dose to the parotid glands increased, given the same tumour coverage. The largest increase was found for increasing leaf transmission. The investigation showed that by changing more than one parameter of the ideal linac/MLC set-up, the increase in the mean dose was smaller than the sum of dose increments for each parameter separately. As a reference to clinical practice, we also optimized the plans of the seven patients with the clinically used Elekta SLi 15, equipped with a standard MLC with a leaf width of 10 mm. As compared to the ideal linac, this resulted in an increase of the average dose to the parotid glands of 5.8 Gy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing

Total body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The irradiation technique with 4 MV X-rays is described. The patients are treated without lung-shieldings. The dose-measurements show an acceptable homogeneity. The applied technique is very easy in comparison with other centers. A main point is making the patient's position as comfortable as possible. The accuracy of dose-application and dose-distribution is considered clinically acceptable

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data of 95 AVM patients were prospectively assessed up to 3 years after radiosurgery. Of these patients, 39 had a follow-up of at least 2 years. Radiosurgery was performed using a modified linear accelerator (minimal doses to the target volume 15-22 Gy, median dose 20). The neuropsychological evaluation included testing of intelligence, attention, and memory. The effect of a preexisting intracranial hemorrhage, as well as AVM occlusion, on cognitive functions was analyzed after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: No cognitive declines were observed during follow-up. Instead significant improvements occurred in intelligence (1 year, +6.1 IQ points; 2 years, +5.1 IQ points), memory (1 year, +18.3 percentile score; 2 years, +12.2 percentile score), and attention (1 year, +19 percentile score; 2 years, +18 percentile score). Patients without previous intracranial hemorrhage improved more than patients with intracranial hemorrhage, although this difference was not statistically significant. The role of AVM occlusion on cognitive function is not clear at present. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery does not induce measurable deterioration of cognitive function in patients with cerebral AVMs	
0	1642	The rush to judgment: Does the evidence support the enthusiasm over three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and dose escalation in the treatment of prostate cancer?.[see comment].

METHODS: We first define 3D-CRT in comparison to standard radiation therapy and discuss the assumptions on which the technology of 3D-CRT and dose escalation are based. We then examine the evidence on the benefits and limitations from the current most commonly cited studies on dose-escalation trials to treat prostate cancer. RESULTS: The assumption that 3D-CRT can provide a tighter margin around the tumor area to allow for dose escalation is not yet proven by studies that show continual difficulty in defining the planning treatment volume because of extrinsic and intrinsic difficulties, such as imaging variabilities and patient and organ movement. Current short-term dose-escalation studies on the use of 3D-CRT to treat prostate cancer are limited in their ability to prove that increasing dose improves survival and does not incur potential long-term complications to normal tissue. CONCLUSION: Although 3D-CRT is a promising technology that many radiation oncologists and clinics are quickly adopting to treat such tumors as prostate cancer, the long-term evidence on the benefits and limitations of this technology is still lacking. Until we have solid long-term evidence on the true clinical potential of this new technology, let us not rush to judgment, but exercise caution, diligence, and thoughtfulness in using this new technology to treat our patients.

0	339	Patient study of in vivo verification of beam delivery and range, using positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging after proton therapy	Algorithms, Feasibility Studies, Humans, Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Massachusetts, Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Positron-Emission Tomography/mt [Methods], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Subtraction Technique, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and value of positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) for treatment verification after proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. RESULTS: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT	
1	157	What is the role of radiation in the treatment of subfoveal membranes: review of radiobiologic, pathologic, and other considerations to initiate a multimodality discussion. [Review] [104 refs]	Aged, Animals, Cerebrovascular Circulation/re [Radiation Effects], Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Humans, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Microcirculation/de [Drug Effects], Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Rats, Research, Retina/re [Radiation Effects], Retinal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Single-dose-fraction conformal proton beam and multiple-fraction X ray dose schedules have been used to treat subfoveal neovascular membranes. All schedules successfully controlled membrane progression, stabilized vision in most patients, and increased visual acuity in some. Conformal protons also decreased the radiation dose to healthy tissues outside the designated volume (16 mm in diameter). It appears that radiation therapy could be useful and cost-effective, but neither the optimal time-dose schedule single or multiple dose fractions nor the type of radiation proton conformal beam or x-ray therapy are defined. METHODS: By means of an extensive literature survey, we reviewed the rationale for using radiation to treat subfoveal neovascularization, examined a paradigm of radiation interaction with tissue, reviewed the histopathology of neovascular membranes, and documented the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of the disease. Accepting that the eye is an extracranial brain extension, and that its microvasculature has properties similar to brain microvessels, we reviewed the radiobiologic response of brain microvessels. We also revisited the controversy concerning the efficacy of single-dose-fraction vs. multifraction schedules. RESULTS: This paper outlines parameters within which radiation therapy's role might be defined, and proposes a clinical radiation-biology scoring program to evaluate radiation effects, based on the SOMA concept. CONCLUSION: A prospective, controlled clinical trial is feasible and is indicated to determine radiation therapy's role in managing the proliferative component of age-related macular degeneration.

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

BSRT is a description of an emerging radiation oncology procedure, where simulation, CT scan, treatment planning, and radiation treatment are synchronized with voluntary breath-hold, forced breath-hold, or breathing gating. The BSRT system consists of a breathing monitoring system (BMOS) and a linear accelerator gating hardware and software package. Two methods, a video camera-based method and the use of wraparound inductive plethysmography (RespiTrace), generate the BMOS signals. The BMOS signals and the synchronized fluoroscopic images are simultaneously recorded in the simulation room and are later analyzed to define the ideal treatment point (ITP) where organ motion is stationary. The BMOS signals at ITP can be used to gate a CT scanner or a linear accelerator to maintain the same organ configuration as in the simulation. The BSRT system allows breath-hold or gating. This dual role allows the system to be applicable for a variety of patients, i.e., the breath-hold method for those patients who can maintain and reproduce the ITP, and the forced breath-hold or gating method for those who are not ideal for voluntary breath-hold	
1	4706	Gemcitabine-related radiation recall in a patient with pancreatic cancer	Antimetabolites,Antineoplastic/ae [Adverse Effects], Breast, Combined Modality Therapy, Connecticut, Deoxycytidine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Deoxycytidine/ae [Adverse Effects], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Hematocrit, Humans, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physical Examination, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pp [Physiopathology], Time, Universities	Radiation recall refers to inflammatory reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents and develops cutaneously in the previously irradiated areas. Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

Patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, schwannoma, and lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the brain were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after treatment with conventional photon and/or proton radiation; samples from healthy volunteers served as controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantitate the cytokines. Before irradiation, most patients had greater amounts of one or more of the cytokines compared with the mean obtained for control plasma. This was especially striking in patients with chondrosarcoma; the mean values for TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, bFGF, and EGF were 1458, 1289, 332, and 92% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. After irradiation, bFGF and total TGF-beta 1 decreased in the majority of tested subjects. In contrast, IL-1 beta was detected only in pediatric patients (all with astrocytoma) and its levels after radiation were 33 to 67% higher than at pretreatment. EGF was found in four patients; post-treatment values were 125 to 608% higher in three of the individuals. These data show that cytokines are present at elevated concentrations in the blood circulation of patients with certain types of brain tumors and that changes in their levels can be detected after radiotherapy. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether these findings contribute to morbidity or therapeutic outcome

Failure to control the primary tumor has been the most common cause for death. Our experience in three patients with small squamous cell cancer of the trachea treated by definitive irradiation is encouraging. The primary tumor was controlled in each patient. Histologic confirmation of tumor sterilization was observed in two. One patient remains alive and well at 54 months; one patient developed an epidural metastases at 16 months and subsequently died; and the third patient developed a separate primary lung cancer at 48 months. Two patients developed significant radiation complications

To design a new protocol that employs epithermal neutron beams in the treatment of glioma patients, we examined the relationship between the radiation dose, histological tumor grade, and clinical outcome. Since 1968, 183 patients with different kinds of brain tumors were treated by BNCT; for this retrospective study, we selected 105 patients with glial tumors who were treated in Japan between 1978 and 1997. In the analysis of side effects due to radiation, we included all the 159 patients treated between 1977 and 2001. With respect to the radiation dose (i.e. physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction), the new protocol prescribes a minimum tumor volume dose of 15 Gy or, alternatively, a minimum target volume dose of 18 Gy. The maximum vascular dose should not exceed 15 Gy (physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction) and the total amount of gamma rays should remain below 10 Gy, including core gamma rays from the reactor and capture gamma in brain tissue. The outcomes for 10 patients who were treated by the new protocol using a new mode composed of thermal and epithermal neutrons are reported

After an apparent failure of the tumor to respond, the eye was enucleated. A predominantly epithelioid cell tumor appeared viable by light microscopy, and a low degree of mitotic activity persisted, despite therapy. The tumor cells, however, displayed degenerative changes ultrastructurally, presumably results of the radiotherapy. These consisted of numerous cytoskeletal filaments, lipid vacuoles, prominent phagolysosomes, and nuclear convolutions and fragmentations. The mitochondria were fewer in number in the present tumor than typically encountered in epithelioid cells. A rare leptomeric structure was discovered, probably an organizational modification of the cytoplasmic filaments. The tumor's capillaries showed radiation-induced changes in terms of thickened basement membranes and perivascular fibrin deposition. The foregoing features are indicative of cellular and metabolic injury from the radiotherapy, but these were evidently not sufficiently injurious to sterilize the tumor

Thirty-one of 34 eyes were retained after treatment. Most melanomas were too large for surgical removal with retention of the eye. Eyes containing very large tumours often had poor visual acuity after treatment

One case exhibited a posterior form, presenting with progressive hyperopia from a serous-macular detachment and choroidal involvement along with retrobulbar involvement. This patient was treated with proton beam irradiation. Two cases displayed an anterior form, with fixed fleshy epibulbar masses resembling salmon patches, and choroidal involvement. The histologic findings from biopsy of these anterior masses are presented. One of these patients was treated with complete excision of the mass and double freeze-thaw cryotherapy of the scleral bed, and the other patient was treated with conventional photon beam irradiation. The clinical features of uveal lymphoid neoplasia in its early form are discussed. Evaluation and treatment strategies for these early forms of uveal lymphoid neoplasia are reviewed

Data on cancer incidence in Europe, Austria, and neighbouring countries are reviewed for the most frequent tumors suitable for charged particle therapy. From these data, the numbers of potential patients suitable for MED-AUSTRON are derived for each tumor site by applying the coefficients proposed in the EULIMA-1992 feasibility study. Whatever the assumptions made, a sufficient and adequate recruitment for MED-AUSTRON can be expected. However, an appropriate referring system has to be established within Austria and also in the neighbouring countries

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles

Symptomatic epilepsy was present in 29 patients (22.5%) before the treatment. It was markedly relieved by the radiosurgery leading to cessation of the seizures in 16 patients, the persisting seizure-free follow-up period ranging from 2 to 8 years (mean 4.5 years). In no case was the epilepsy worsened by radiosurgery. The positive effect on epilepsy was not strictly dependent on the angiographic result, suggesting that the ionizing radiation by itself could lead to inhibition of epileptic activity around the AVM

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

This study was to evaluate prognostic factors of patients with cerebral glioma treated with radiotherapy. METHODS: Records of 158 patients with cerebral glioma, including 123 patients with astrocytoma (AC), 12 patients with oligodendroglioma (OD) or mixed oligoastrocytoma (OA), and 23 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), received radiotherapy in our center were analyzed. Eighty patients received total resection, 77 received subtotal resection, and 1 received biopsy before radiotherapy. Median radiation dose was 58 Gy (36-75 Gy). Median waiting time from operation to radiotherapy was 29 days (12-261 days). Sixty-eight patients received chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy. Cox model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23 months (2-62 months), 27 patients relapsed, and 57 patients died. The 2- and 4-year overall survival rate were 66.5% and 45.7%. Univariate analysis showed that histologic grade (I/II vs. II/IV), histologic type (AC/OD vs. GBM), Karnofsky performance state (KPS) before radiotherapy (>/=80 vs.< 80), extent of resection (total vs non-total), and age(</=40 years vs. >40 years) were significant predictors in association with overall survival rate of patients with glioma. Multivariate analysis showed that histologic grade (P=0.001), age (P=0.006), KPS before radiotherapy (P=0.009), and extent of resection (P=0.037) were independent prognostic factors of glioma. CONCLUSION: Low grade (I/II), age </=40 years, KPS>/=80 before radiotherapy, and total resection are independent factors for predicting better survival of glioma patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 57 patients with a median age of 55 years. Management included plaque radiotherapy (14), proton beam radiotherapy (17), local resection (10), endoresection (6), and enucleation (10). Fifty-two tumours involved the choroid. The tumours had a mean diameter of 11.4 mm and a mean thickness of 5.2 mm. RESULTS: The follow-up period had a median of 267 days. Retention of the eye was achieved in all 47 cases who underwent conservative management. Ninety percent of patients retained a vision of counting fingers, with an acuity of 6/12 or better in 50%. CONCLUSION: This group of patients gives an indication of the results that can be expected when uveal melanoma is managed by a variety of conservative techniques in a specialised ocular oncology service

Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity

Of 37, 34 were operated on. Three were considered inoperable and were treated with radiotherapy (including proton beam). Of the 34 operated (30 AVM), 31 (24 AVM) were totally removed. None of them died or exhibitied deterioration. Of the 3 partially operated cases, one improved, two remained unchanged, but one of the two died of rebleeding 3 months later. Two of the radiated cases were later severely incapacitated due to rebleeding. One that underwent proton therapy is still under observation without deterioration after 18 months

As examples of such contribution, radiobiologically-elaborated continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) has been proven to be superior to conventional radiotherapy against non-small cell lung cancer, and a hypoxic cell sensitizer nimorazole has been proven to be effective against pharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal cancers. Based on laboratory studies, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone in many cancers. Radiation biology has also provided important fundamental data for clinical applications of heavy ion and proton beam therapy. In the future, useful predictive assays and radioprotectors are also expected to be developed. Radiation biology should continue to contribute to the further development of clinical radiation therapy. [References: 13]

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation	
1	1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

Since November 1987, 26 patients with resectable gastric cancer were irradiated intraoperatively with the linear accelerator using fast electrons (single dose: 12 to 16 Gy). Percutaneous radiotherapy was performed postoperatively with 24 to 38 Gy (4 x 2 Gy per week). For intraoperative and percutaneous radiotherapy the target absorbed dose was selected in a way that their combined effect on the tumor was approximately equivalent to that of a total dose of 60 Gy in the usual fractionating. Up to now, the median survival time for stage III patients (UICC 1987) has been twelve months. In five patients who died of a relapse or of peritoneal carcinosis, histologic evaluation revealed in every case a diffuse tumor type according to Lauren-classification. All relapses occurred within the first eight months. The two-year survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier is 67% for stage III. Advanced resectable gastric cancer of the intestinal tumor type seems to profit from adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy. The results warrant further research within the framework of a prospective randomized multicenter study

Of the heavy charged particles, protons are the least expensive to accelerate and can be manipulated to give a sharply defined high-dose volume with a rapid fall-off of dose outside the target area. The biological properties of protons do not differ significantly from X or gamma rays. Negative pi mesons require an elaborate accelerator for their production. Pions offer the possibility of concentrating energy, some of it densely ionizing with a reduced oxygen enhancement ratio and elevated biological effectiveness within the designated tumour volume, while minimizing the dose of sparsely ionizing radiation to the normal tissues traversed. High-energy heavy ions offer the greatest flexibility and allow localized dose distributions and also, with the higher Z particles, a substantial reduction of the oxygen enhancement ratio can be achieved. The ultimate choice of particle depends upon what turns out to be the most important factor in radiotherapy--an improved localization of dose or a reduction in the dependence of cell killing on the presence of molecular oxygen

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1993 and 2004, 88 patients with iris melanoma received proton beam radiotherapy, with 53.1 Gy in 4 fractions. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 52 years and a median follow-up of 2.7 years. The tumors had a median diameter of 4.3 mm, involving more than 2 clock hours of iris in 32% of patients and more than 2 hours of angle in 27%. The ciliary body was involved in 20%. Cataract was present in 13 patients before treatment and subsequently developed in another 18. Cataract had a 4-year rate of 63% and by Cox analysis was related to age (p = 0.05), initial visual loss (p < 0.0001), iris involvement (p < 0.0001), and tumor thickness (p < 0.0001). Glaucoma was present before treatment in 13 patients and developed after treatment in another 3. Three eyes were enucleated, all because of recurrence, which had an actuarial 4-year rate of 3.3% (95% CI 0-8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma is well tolerated, the main problems being radiation-cataract, which was treatable, and preexisting glaucoma, which in several patients was difficult to control

Our study focuses on a complex formed by the estrogen response element (ERE) DNA and the recombinant human estrogen receptor alpha (ER), which mediates the signalling of female sex hormones, estrogens. The method of native polyacrylamide retardation gel electrophoresis is used to study the stability of the complex under irradiation by low LET radiation ((60)Co gamma rays) and the ability of the separately irradiated partners to form complexes. The relative probabilities of ERE DNA strand breakage and base damages as well as the probabilities of damages to the ER binding domain are calculated using the Monte Carlo method-based model RADACK

The physics of the proton beam in radiosurgery is explained, and the different factors of beam delivery are examined. These key factors (correspondence to shape, accuracy of delineation of volume, correspondence to volume, and accuracy of delivery vary) with each of the radiosurgical techniques, from Gamma Knife surgery to linear accelerator therapy.

The tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density, and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing method

This characteristic is known for charged particle beams. In a field study based on German cooperative trials, the possibility of a charged particle radiotherapy to retroperitoneal tumors of childhood will be discussed regarding indications in risk groups and recurrences. Absolute patient numbers are estimated from the clinical experiences and the incidences of the diseases. A stepwise introduction of this new therapy modality is proposed

This paper discusses the potential of 211At targeted by antibodies for tumor therapy and the possible advantage of 211At over beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides such as 131I currently employed in the field of radioimmunotherapy. Since the longest range alpha-particle from 211At is only 67 microns and the rate of energy loss is high (track averaged linear energy transfer LT approximately 120 keV/micron), a disintegration of 211At produces a large and extremely localized deposition of energy. A Monte-Carlo model has been developed for studying the stochastic fluctuation of alpha-particle hits and energy deposition in cell nuclei in an attempt to determine the efficacy of 211At-labeled antibodies for tumor cell inactivation. Calculations have been performed for 2 extreme conditions: (a) the case of 211At retained in the capillary, and (b) for a homogeneous distribution of 211At-labeled antibody in the tumor. The results of these two calculations represent the boundary conditions between which any real solution must lie. Finally, developments to the model to include antibody transport across the capillary membrane and through the tumor tissue are discussed

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass 10 cm in diameter in the region of the middle clivus enhanced inhomogeneously by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and a defect in the skull base. There was evidence of compression of the anterior surface of the pons. He received proton irradiation employing a pair of parallel opposed lateral proton beams. The dose aimed at the tumor mass was 75.5 Gy, to the pharyngeal wall less than 38 Gy, and to the anterior portion of the pons less than 30 Gy. Time dose and fractionation factor was calculated at 148. Thirty-one months following treatment, he was free of clinical neurological sequelae. Proton therapy should be considered in treatment planning following initial surgical removal or for inoperable clivus chordoma

Proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE), making use of the resonance reaction of 19F(p, alpha gamma)16O at 872 keV, and cyclic neutron activation analysis (CNAA), using the 19F(n, gamma)20F reaction in a reactor irradiation facility, were employed. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was used to calculate the volume, and, hence, mass of the sample excited in PIGE by determining the major element composition of the samples in order to express results in terms of concentration. From this preliminary investigation, a relationship is suggested between fluorine concentrations in bone and aluminium levels in the system

Ideally, the particle selected to deliver ionizing radiation for routine therapy should control the disease, cause minimal side effects, and be affordable. Two major properties for judging the utility of a particle, physical controllability and selective cell destruction, influence the decision for selection. The proton, at present, has the best combination of capabilities for routine radiation therapy. Heavier ions require further study to determine their role in patient treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system for the exchange of radiotherapy data between different commercial planning systems and a specially developed planning system for proton therapy has been developed through the use of the PAPYRUS diagnostic image standard as an intermediate format. To ensure the cooperation of the different TPS manufacturers, the number of data sets defined for transfer has been restricted to the three core data sets of CT, VOIs, and three-dimensional dose distributions. As a complement to the exchange of data, network-wide application-sharing (video-conferencing) technologies have been adopted to provide methods for the interactive discussion and assessment of treatments plans with one or more partner clinics. RESULTS: Through the use of evaluation plans based on the exchanged data, referring clinics can accurately assess the advantages offered by proton therapy on a patient-by-patient basis, while the practicality or otherwise of the proposed treatments can simultaneously be assessed by the proton therapy center. Such a system, along with the interactive capabilities provided by video-conferencing methods, has been found to be an efficient solution to the problem of patient assessment and selection at a specialized treatment center, and is a necessary first step toward the full electronic integration of such centers with their remotely situated referral centers

METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects with subfoveal CNVM due to AMD were randomly assigned to 16-Gy proton irradiation delivered in two fractions 24 hours apart or to sham control treatment. Recruitment was halted at 37 subjects for ethical reasons regarding randomization to sham treatment when Food and Drug Administration approval of Visudyne was anticipated. RESULTS: Proton irradiation was associated with a trend toward stabilization of visual acuity, but this association did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found within the fluorescein angiography data, including greatest linear dimension of CNVM total size, area of active leakage, area of associated subretinal hemorrhage, and intensity. CONCLUSIONS: With the acceptance of photodynamic therapy, future studies will require more complex design and larger sample size to determine whether radiation can play either a primary or adjunctive role in treating these lesions

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients having adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands were treated with fast neutron radiotherapy during the years 1985-1994. All patients had either unresectable disease or gross disease remaining after attempted surgical extirpation. Seventeen patients had previously received conventional radiotherapy and their subsequent treatment fields and doses for neutron radiotherapy were modified for critical sites (brainstem, spinal cord, brain). Although the median doses (tumor maximum and tumor minimum) only varied by < or = 10%, treatment portals were substantially smaller in these patients because of normal tissue complication considerations. Twelve patients (13%) had distant metastases at the time of treatment and were only treated palliatively with smaller treatment portals and lower median tumor doses (< or = 80% of the doses delivered to curatively treated patients). Seventy-two patients were treated with curative intent, with nine of these having recurrent tumors after prior full-dose radiotherapy. The median duration of follow-up at the time of analysis was 31.5 months (range 3-115). Sites of disease and number of patients treated per disease site were as follows: paranasal sinus-31; oral cavity-20; oropharynx-12; nasopharynx-11; trachea-6; and other sites in the head and neck-4. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial local-regional tumor control rate for all patients treated with curative intent was 47%. Patients without involvement of the cavernous sinus, base of skull, or nasopharynx (51 patients) had a 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate of 59%, whereas local-regional control was significantly lower (15%) for patients with tumors involving these sites (p < 0.005). In the latter cases, normal tissue injury considerations precluded delivery of the full dose to the entire tumor. Patients with no history of prior radiotherapy (63 patients) had an actuarial local control rate of 57% at 5 years compared to 18% for those (9 patients) who had been previously irradiated with conventional photons (p = 0.018). Eliminating the dose-limiting factors of prior radiation therapy and/or high risk sites of involvement, the 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate for these 46 patients was 63%, with an actuarial cause specific survival rate of 79%. Lymph node status was a predictor of distant metastasis: 57% of node positive patients developed distant metastases by 5 years compared to 15% of patients with negative nodes (p < 0.0005), and patients who had nodal involvement developed distant metastases sooner than node negative patients (p < 0.0001). The 5-year actuarial overall survival and cause specific survival for the 72 patients treated with curative intent were 59% and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fast neutron radiotherapy offers high local-regional control and survival rates for patients with locally advanced, unresectable adenoid cystic carcinomas of minor salivary glands. It should be considered as initial primary treatment for these patients, as well as for other patients in whom surgical extirpation would cause considerable morbidity

These include gamma units using cobalt-60; beams of protons, helium ions and neutrons; and modified cobalt-60 or linear accelerator units. These techniques allow delivery of a high dose of radiation in a single fraction to a small and well-defined intracranial volume, without delivering significant radiation to adjacent normal tissue. The most usual targets for radiosurgery are arteriovenous malformations. It is occasionally used for acoustic neuromas and primary or metastatic brain malignancies as well. Although radiosurgery is not a new procedure, its use is becoming more widespread. Nurses, as critical members of radiosurgery teams, must be informed about all aspects of the procedures and associated nursing care skills. [References: 7]

Use of this technique to its full potential requires dose calculation algorithms which are capable of precisely simulating each scanned beam individually. Different specialized analytical dose calculations have been developed, which attempt to model the effects of density heterogeneities in the patient's body on the dose. Their accuracy has been evaluated by a comparison with Monte Carlo calculated dose distributions in the case of a simple geometrical density interface parallel to the beam and typical anatomical situations. A specialized ray casting model which takes range dilution effects (broadening of the spectrum of proton ranges) into account has been found to produce results of good accuracy. This algorithm can easily be implemented in the iterative optimization procedure used for the calculation of the optimal contribution of each individual scanned pencil beam. In most cases an elemental pencil beam dose calculation has been found to be most accurate. Due to the long computing time, this model is currently used only after the optimization procedure as an alternative method of calculating the dose

The initial 30 patients were treated with proton beams; the subsequent 810 patients were treated with helium ion beams. In the great majority of the 475 patients treated for pituitary tumors, marked and sustained biochemical and clinical improvement was observed. Variable degrees of hypopituitarism developed in about one-third of patients treated solely with radiosurgery. In the earlier years of the program, 365 patients underwent radiosurgery to treat selected systemic diseases by inducing hypopituitarism. Focal temporal lobe necrosis and cranial nerve injury occurred in about 1% of patients who were treated with doses less than 230 Gy

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Grade 1 and 4 gliomas were excluded. Patients benefited from a 3D dose calculation based on high-definition CT and MRI, a stereotactic positioning using implanted fiducial markers and a thermoplastic mask. Mean tumor dose ranged between 63 and 67 Gy delivered in five weekly sessions of 1.8 Gy in most patients, according to the histological types (doses in Co Gy Equivalent, with a mean proton-RBE of 1.1). RESULTS: With a median 18-month follow-up (range: four-58 months), local control in tumors located in the envelopes and in the skull base was 97% (33/34), and in parenchymal tumors, 43% (6/14) only. Two patients (5%) presented with a clinically severe radiation-induced necrosis (temporal lobe and chiasm). CONCLUSION: In our experience, high-dose radiation combining photons and protons is a safe and highly efficient procedure in selected malignancies of the skull base and envelopes

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The motion of a patient due to respiration is detected by the motion of the body surface around the chest wall. A respiratory sensor was developed using an infrared light spot and a position-sensitive detector. A timing signal to request a beam is generated in response to the respiration waveform, and a carbon beam is extracted from the synchrotron using a RF-knockout method. CT images for treatment planning are taken in synchronization with the respiratory motion. For patient positioning, digitized fluoroscopic images superimposed with the respiration waveform were used. The relation between the respiratory sensor signal and the organ motion was examined using digitized video images from fluoroscopy. The performance of our gated system was demonstrated by using the moving phantom, and dose profiles were measured in the direction of phantom motion. RESULTS: The timing of gate-on is set at the end of the expiratory phase, because the motion of the diaphragm is slower and more reproducible than during the inspiratory phase. The signal of the respiratory sensor shows a phase difference of 120 milliseconds between lower and upper locations on the chest wall. The motion of diaphragm is delayed by 200 milliseconds from the respiration waveform at the lower location. The beam extraction system worked according to the beam on/off logic for gating, and the gated CT scanner performed well. The lateral penumbra size of the dose profile along the moving axis was distinguishably decreased by the gated irradiation. The ratio of the nongated to gated lateral fall-off was 4.3, 3.5, and 2. 0 under the stroke of 40.0, 29.0, and 13.0 mm respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed a total treatment system of gated irradiation for heavy-ion radiotherapy. We found that with this system the target margin along the body axis could be decreased to 5-10 mm although the target moved twice or three times. Over 150 patients with lung or liver cancer had already been treated by this gated irradiation system by the end of July 1999

We have experimentally investigated the intra-fractional organ motion effects in lung IMRT treatments delivered by multi-leaf collimator (MLC). An in-house made motor-driven platform, which moves sinusoidally with an amplitude of 1 cm and a period of 4 s, was used to mimic tumour motion. Tumour motion was simulated along cranial-caudal direction while MLC leaves moved across the patient from left to right, as in most clinical cases. The dose to a point near the centre of the tumour mass was measured according to geometric and dosimetric parameters from two five-field lung IMRT plans. For each field, measurement was done for two dose rates (300 and 500 MU min(-1)), three MLC delivery modes (sliding window, step-and-shoot with 10 and 20 intensity levels) and eight equally spaced starting phases of tumour motion. The dose to the measurement point delivered from all five fields was derived for both a single fraction and 30 fractions by randomly sampling from measured dose values of each field at different initial phases. It was found that the mean dose to a moving tumour differs slightly (<2-3%) from that to a static tumour. The variation in breathing phase at the start of dose delivery results in a maximum variation around the mean dose of greater than 30% for one field. The full width at half maximum for the probability distribution of the point dose is up to 8% for all five fields in a single fraction, but less than 1-2% after 30 fractions. In general, lower dose rate can reduce the motion-caused dose variation and therefore might be preferable for lung IMRT when no motion mitigation techniques are used. From the two IMRT cases we studied where tumour motion is perpendicular to MLC leaf motion, the dose variation was found to be insensitive to the MLC delivery mode	
0	897	Radiation exposure of personnel during intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT): radiation protection aspects	Combined Modality Therapy/mt [Methods], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Italy, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Neutrons, Occupational Exposure, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a multidisciplinary procedure which combines two conventional methods of cancer treatment surgery and radiation therapy. The purpose is to deliver a large single dose to the surgically exposed tumor bed while minimizing doses to normal tissues. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is a technique which allows irradiating the patient directly after the surgical operation using a linear accelerator that can be situated in the operating room. For medical accelerators with energy over 10MeV the need to characterize the neutron spectra for this particular situation arises from the fact that, when neutron spectra is not fully known, it becomes necessary to be more cautious introducing a weight factor wR of 20 (maximum value). This leads to overesteem the equivalent dose due to neutrons and it indicates to introduce additional (mobile) shields for photon and neutrons radiation not easily achievable in an operating room

Focussed accelerated helium ion beams derived from charged-particle cyclotrons are stereotactically directed into the brain to obliterate abnormal shunts. Treated patients demonstrate delayed changes in brain anatomy and function that occur months to years after radiosurgery. The underlying mechanisms of the brain's delayed reaction to charged-particle radiosurgery involve complex perturbations in cerebrovascular and metabolic function. This report describes the wide range of delayed reactions that may occur in the brain after radiosurgery, including hemodynamic changes, blood-brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema, metabolic suppression, and parenchymal necrosis. These delayed reactions to injury in the brain involve potential target cells that include cerebral endothelial cells, oligodendroglia and astrocytes

Heavy charged particle radiotherapy offers the potential advantages of improved dose localization and/or enhanced biologic effect, depending on particle selected for treatment. Target sites have included selected head and neck tumors, ocular melanomata, malignant gliomata of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the stomach, carcinoma of the pancreas, selected juxtaspinal tumors and other locally advanced, unresectable tumors. A Phase III prospective clinical trial has been started in carcinoma of the pancreas using helium ions. Phase I-II studies are underway with heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions in order to prepare for prospective Phase III trials. Silicon ions are also under consideration for clinical trial. These studies are supported by the United States Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and February 1997, 24 patients with histopathologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were treated to 15 fractions within 5 weeks in a step-wise dose-escalation study. The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92% and 92%, 81% and 50%, and 81% and 25% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy appears safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional clinical studies using a larger subject group are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas

This represents the largest group evaluated histologically in the literature and is the first report evaluating effects of particle radiation in pancreatic tissue. Patient survival after therapy averaged 9 months. Most died of infection and/or pulmonary emboli. Local control was achieved in 27%. The pancreatic tumors had histologically more severe radiation changes than nontumor bearing pancreas. Irradiated bone marrow was severely hypocellular, and irradiated skin was atrophic. Five patients had radiation injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal cord, liver, and kidneys showed no damage. This study demonstrates the safety of helium particle irradiation with present therapeutic planning. Injury to tumor was seen without excessive damage to adjacent tissues

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

High initial level of alpha 1-antitrypsin(alpha 1-AT) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-MG) in the patients blood plasma as well as a decrease in alpha 1-AT activity in cerebrospinal fluid were observed. Within a year after the proton hypophysectomy activity of the proteinase inhibitors returned to the normal values in blood and cerebrospinal fluid simultaneously with clinical restoration and a decrease in content of growth hormone; their level were maintained at normal values within the last two years of observation. Estimation of alpha 1-At activity in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid might be used as an additional test in evaluation of the treatment course in the patients with somatotropic adenoma of hypophysis

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

We consider the factors influencing the peripheral dose (PD) of 10MV X-ray radiotherapy to be the distance between the caudal edge of the irradiation field and the measuring point, the size of the therapeutic irradiation field, the thickness of the lead shield laid above and lateral to the disease-free testis, and the thickness of the lateral absorber. Materials and methods: We measured the scattering radiation dose coming from the accelerator head and that due to irradiation volume. We measured these doses using a testicular phantom as the non-diseased testis.Results: Scattering radiation from the accelerator head mainly contributes to PD, whereas the larger the size of the irradiation field the more the scattering radiation from the irradiation volume contributed to PD. PD changed more at the surface of the phantom than at its center. PD at the testicular phantom could be reduced to less than 1% of the therapeutic dose when it was situated more than 5cm distant from the caudal limit of the irradiation field, the lead shield above the testicular phantom was 7.5cm thick, and the lateral lead shield was 2mm thick.Conclusions: PD is influenced by many factors. It is necessary to clarify the change in PD at the testicular phantom, and it is important to limit the caudal edge of the irradiation field and to lay the lead shield for the attenuation of radiation on the disease-free testis

Patients were followed for eighteen to forty-five months with regard to progression of disease and development of long-term complications. Upstaging to Stage D1 by virtue of discovering pelvic node involvement was noted in 16 patients (53.3 per cent). Subsequent disease progression (defined as development of bone or soft tissue metastasis) was seen in 9 of 16 upstaged patients with an average time to progression of 12.2 months. Three Stage D1 patients have died with an average time to death of 19.6 months. Only 1 patient whose lymphadenectomy was negative has experienced disease progression, and none has died. Adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride) was given to 9 upstaged patients, in only 3 did disease progress. In contrast, in 6 of 7 upstaged patients not receiving chemotherapy metastatic disease developed, with an average time to progression of 10.3 months. In an attempt to improve local tumor control achieved by interstitial irradiation alone, 18 patients received additional external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, in doses ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 rad. There were sixteen long-term complications in the 30 patients, 75 per cent of which were seen in patients receiving added external beam irradiation

The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy were seen to be important prognostic factors. The following survival patterns were observed. In eight cases with limited plaque disease there was prolonged disease-free survival after treatment with kilovoltage X-rays; after a median follow-up of 64 months there was only one case of progression to generalized disease. In 49 cases of generalized skin disease (plaque disease +/- tumours; erythroderma) treated with total skin electron beam therapy there was a 24% 5-year disease-free survival; this potential for long-term survival was seen in cases with generalized plaque disease without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the cases showed a continuously relapsing course. The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy can both be used as known prognostic factors to adopt a logical plan of treatment

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis

Results of the first 42 treated tumors in 31 patients are presented. Most of the patients had solitary tumors in liver, lung or retroperitoneal space. Clinical target volumes ranged from 2 to 622 cm3 (mean 78 cm3) and minimum doses to the planning target volumes (PTV) of 7.7-30 Gy/fraction (mean 14.2 Gy) were given on 1-4 occasions to a total minimum dose to the PTVs of 7.7-45 Gy (mean 30.2 Gy) to the periphery of the PTV and total mean doses to the PTVs of 8-66 Gy (mean 41 Gy). The central part of the tumor was usually given about 50% higher dose compared to that of the periphery of the PTV by a planned inhomogeneous dose distribution. Some of the patients received stereotactic radiation therapy concomitantly to more than one target, in others new metastases were also treated which appeared during the follow-up period.

Detailed results have been published previously [17]. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1972 and 1993, 57 patients were treated curatively with radiation alone (n = 13) or combined surgery and pre- and/or postoperative irradiation (n = 44). Gross complete resection was achieved in 82% of patients and margins were negative in 5 patients. Doses ranged from 36.0 to 79.2 Gy (median 64.8 Gy), usually conventionally fractionated. In 16 patients protons were used. Median follow-up time was 4.3 years (range 1.1 to 16.8 years). RESULTS: After 5 years, patients with angiosarcomas (n = 11) and patients with other tumor types (n = 46) had locoregional control rates of 24% and 69%, distant failure rates of 58% and 17%, and overall survival rates of (for overall survival) and T stage (for locoregional control) (p < 0.05). Particularly, gross completely resected T1 tumors had a locoregional control rate of 91%. Patients with locoregional recurrence were at an increased risk to die (p = 0.004 in multivariate analysis). Patients with and without direct tumor extension to neurovascular structures, bones, organs, or skin had distant failure rates of 27% and 0%, respectively (p = 0.031). In multivariate analysis, direct extension was additionally a negative prognosticator of overall survival (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: 1. Angiosarcomas of the head and neck have a considerably poorer prognosis than other soft tissue sarcomas of this region. 2. Head and neck sarcomas have a higher local recurrence rate than for example soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. Optimisation of local treatment through combination of surgery and high-dose irradiation, however, can achieve improved results, especially for prognostically favourable subgroups. 3. In addition to tumor grade and size, direct tumor extension may be a useful additional staging parameter	
0	631	Intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy (ELIOT) to the breast: a need for a quality assurance programme	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Care/st [Standards], Italy, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant/st [Standards], Research	Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a technique in which a high, single-fraction radiation dose is delivered directly to the tumour bed during a surgical intervention, after the removal of a neoplastic mass. IORT has been recently used in early stage cancer as an exclusive radiation modality, rather than as a boost, especially for breast tumours, in particular at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, where the technique has been called electron intraoperative therapy (ELIOT). Our studies on more than 1000 patients have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique and it is expected that its application will become more widespread in the immediate future. It is important to emphasise that ELIOT relies not only on new technological developments, but also on a multidisciplinary team with clear roles and responsibilities, the establishment of a programme of quality assurance with appropriate guidelines and a comprehensive staff development programme

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma

The current paradigm requires stereotactic head ring placement for the patient's first fraction. The stereotactic coordinates and treatment plan are determined relative to this head ring. The IRLEDs are attached to the patient via a maxillary bite plate, and the position of the IRLEDs relative to linac isocenter is saved to file. These positions are then recalled for each subsequent treatment to position the patient for fractionated therapy. The purpose of this article was to report a method of predicting the desired IRLED locations without need for the invasive head ring. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To achieve the goal of frameless optic-guided radiotherapy, a method is required for direct localization of the IRLED positions from a CT scan. Because it is difficult to localize the exact point of light emission from a CT scan of an IRLED, a new bite plate was designed that contains eight aluminum fiducial markers along with the six IRLEDs. After a calibration procedure to establish the spatial relationship of the IRLEDs to the aluminum fiducial markers, the stereotactic coordinates of the IRLED light emission points are determined by localizing the aluminum fiducial markers in a stereotactic CT scan. RESULTS: To test the accuracy of direct CT determination of the IRLED positions, phantom tests were performed. The average accuracy of isocenter localization using the IRLED bite plate was 0.65 +/- 0. 17 mm for these phantom tests. In addition, the optic-guided system has a unique compatibility with the stereotactic head ring. Therefore, the isocentric localization capability was clinically tested using the stereotactic head ring as the absolute standard. The ongoing clinical trial has shown the frameless system to provide a patient localization accuracy of 1.11 +/- 0.3 mm compared with the head ring. CONCLUSION: Optic-guided radiotherapy using IRLEDs provides a mechanism through which setup accuracy may be improved over conventional techniques. To date, this optic-guided therapy has been used only as a hybrid system that requires use of the stereotactic head ring for the first fraction. This has limited its use in the routine clinical setting. Computation of the desired IRLED positions eliminates the need for the invasive head ring for the first fraction. This allows application of optic-guided therapy to a larger cohort of patients, and also facilitates the initiation of extracranial optic-guided radiotherapy

The choice of therapy depends on many factors, and plaque radiotherapy is often used. OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcome of plaque radiotherapy in the management of ciliary body melanoma and to identify the risk factors associated with the development of radiation complications, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and melanoma-related death after plaque radiotherapy of ciliary body melanoma. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical records of 136 patients with ciliary body melanoma who were treated with plaque radiotherapy between July 1976 and June 1992. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the most frequent radiation complication at 5 years' follow-up was cataract, developing in 48% of the patients, followed by neovascular glaucoma (21%), retinopathy (20%), scleral necrosis (12%), and vitreous hemorrhage (11%). Visual acuity decrease (by > or =3 Snellen lines) was noted in 40% of the patients at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 8% of the patients developed recurrence, 28% had metastasis, and 22% died of melanoma-related causes by 5 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the factors predictive of radiation cataract were superonasal (P = .003) and inferior tumor meridian (P = .02) compared with inferonasal meridian and apex dose rate greater than 57 cGy/h (P = .05). The development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly related to iris involvement with the ciliary body tumor (P<.001). The factors predictive of development of radiation retinopathy were base dose rate greater than 230 cGy/h (P = .03) and the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = .05). The only predictor of metastasis was tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02). The risk factors for melanoma-related death were the presence of metastasis (P<.001), tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02), and recurrence (P = .02). Multivariate analyses showed that the most significant variables predictive of the development of scleral necrosis were intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .007). The most significant predictive factors for vitreous hemorrhage were visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 (P = .02) and intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P = .02). The best subset of independent predictors of vision decrease were mushroom tumor shape (P = .002), age older than 61 years (P = .006), and superonasal meridian (P = .04). The risks for melanoma-related death were presence of metastasis (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .01). There was no group of significant variables predictive for radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plaque radiotherapy offers 92% 5-year local control rate for ciliary body melanoma. Metastasis occurs in 28% of the patients treated with this method by 5 years. Patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in thickness are at greater risk than patients with thinner tumors for metastatic disease and melanoma-related death. Major radiation complications include radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, and scleral necrosis

We sought to determine if MI levels correlate with cerebral astrocytoma grade. METHODS: Five control subjects, 14 patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 10 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent single-volume HMRS with an echo time of 20 ms. Twenty-five patients had received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy previously. Using the curve-fitting program supplied by the manufacturer, peak areas for n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and MI were normalized with respect to the peak area of creatine (Cr). Ratios for MI/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr were obtained for each lesion and retrospectively compared with the histologic grade of the lesion. RESULTS: Levels of MI/Cr were higher (0.82 +/- 0.25) in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, intermediate (0.49 +/- 0.07) in control subjects, and lower in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (0.33 +/- 0.16) and GBM (0.15 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a trend toward lower MI levels in the presence of anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs compared with those of low-grade astrocytomas. MI levels may have implications in the grading of cerebral astrocytomas

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma

In the case of proton therapy, secondary neutrons generated in the accelerator head and inside the patient reach many areas in the patient body. Due to the improved efficacy of management of cancer patients, the number of long term survivors post-radiation treatment is increasing substantially. This results in concern about the risk of radiation-induced cancer appearing at late post-treatment times. This paper presents a case study to determine the effective dose from secondary neutrons in patients undergoing proton treatment. A whole-body patient model, VIP-Man, was employed as the patient model. The geometry dataset generated from studies made on VIP-Man was implemented into the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code. Two proton treatment plans for tumours in the lung and paranasal sinus were simulated. The organ doses and ICRP-60 radiation and tissue weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. Results show whole body effective doses for the two proton plans of 0.162 Sv and 0.0266 Sv, respectively, to which the major contributor is due to neutrons from the proton treatment nozzle. There is a substantial difference among organs depending on the treatment site

However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients
