All patients had received curative pelvic irradiation (greater than or equal to 1750 reu) nine to 133 months prior to the investigation. Eleven patients had recurrent or persistent disease and four (36%) of these patients had severe hematuria. The urinary morbidity of the 37 patients without evidence of disease varied between 24 and 38%, but only 3 to 8% of these patients experienced severe disturbances. Four patients (9%) had to undergo bowl resection due to severe radiation damage in the intestines. In conclusion, slight morbidity after curative radiation treatment is to be expected in about 30% of patients surviving more than six months. Severe complications may be expected in 10% of the patients. Serious complaints from the urologic tract, especially hematuria, indicate recurrent or persistent disease rather than a late radiation effect

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in 78 patients who underwent MR spectroscopy for evaluation of a focal brain mass suspected of being neoplastic. MR spectroscopic findings were positive for neoplasm in 49 patients and negative in 29. Treatment with or without performance of biopsy was noted. In patients with positive findings who underwent irradiation or chemotherapy without biopsy and in patients with negative findings who were treated medically or followed up for interval changes, MR spectroscopy was classified as having a potential positive influence on treatment. In patients with positive findings with subsequently proved nonneoplastic lesions and in patients with negative findings with subsequently proved tumors, MR spectroscopy was classified as having a potential negative influence. RESULTS: MR spectroscopy in eight (16%) patients with positive findings and in 15 (52%) patients with negative findings had a potential positive influence on treatment. In two (3%) patients, MR spectroscopy had a potential negative influence. CONCLUSION: MR spectroscopy may play a beneficial role in the management of suspected brain tumors. Prospective studies are needed to test the effect of MR spectroscopy on clinical practice and to measure costs and benefits

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the frequency of HP dysfunction in adults after RT for nonpituitary brain tumors. METHOD: We studied 56 adult patients who received external beam RT for primary nonpituitary brain tumors at time intervals of 12-150 months after RT. The control group consisted of 20 RT-naive patients with primary brain tumors. GH and adrenal axes were assessed using the insulin tolerance test or the glucagon stimulation test. Gonadotroph, thyrotroph, and lactotroph function were assessed using baseline blood measurements. The biological effective dose (BED) to the HP axis was calculated in the RT patients. RESULTS: Hypopituitarism was present in 41% of patients. The frequency of GH, ACTH, gonadotropin, and TSH deficiencies, and hyperprolactinemia was 32, 21, 27, 9, and 32%, respectively. Any degree of hypopituitarism and GH deficiency was significantly associated with longer time interval from RT and greater BED. However, gonadotropin deficiency and hyperprolactinemia were only related to BED, whereas ACTH deficiency was only significantly associated with the time interval from RT. One RT-naive patient was GH deficient. CONCLUSION: Adult patients treated with cranial irradiation for primary nonpituitary brain tumors are at high risk of hypopituitarism, which is time and dose dependent. Long-term surveillance and periodic evaluation are needed. We recommend that adult late effect clinics, similar to those for children, should be established

The time-attenuation curves, time of appearance and recovery, and 3D size reduction pattern are described in patients of different ages and genders with different irradiation doses, irradiated portals, and Child groups. METHOD: Forty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 50 to 84 Gy proton beam irradiation in periods of 14-52 days. CT including noncontrast and dynamic study was performed every 3 months starting 3 weeks after the end of irradiation. The 3D volume measurement of areas of radiation-induced hepatic injury was performed through incremental dynamic CT images in every follow-up study. CT follow-up study of the patients was done for 12-76 months. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as low attenuation areas on noncontrast CT and enhanced areas on dynamic study in the regions corresponding to the irradiation portals. Of our cases, 67.5% showed the appearance of radiation hepatitis in 3-4 weeks and 95.3% in 3-4 months after the end of irradiation. In both periods, there was a significant delay in the female patients. The time-attenuation curve showed an early and prolonged enhancement of the irradiated regions. The volume reduction pattern of the injured areas was found to be longstanding, exponential, and directed from periphery to the center. CONCLUSION: Early appearance of radiation-induced hepatic injury was found only to be gender dependent, with a tendency to occur with higher irradiated doses; no other parameters affected this phenomenon in our cases. Disappearance of the injured areas, if present, takes a long time (at least 42 months)

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic techniques of carbon ion therapy have been established for patients with prostate cancer. Carbon ion therapy may exert excellent effect to the tissues of prostate cancer.

To establish heavy ion therapy for prostate cancer, three trials have been conducted. For 247 patients with T1b-T3 cancer, carbon ion beam was irradiated 20 times/5 weeks with or without endocrine therapy. Overall and cause-specific survivals were excellent and local control was achieved in all patients except one. Grade 3 late morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra was developed in 7 cases who received higher dose. Thus, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment. In conclusion, carbon ion therapy is expected to exert excellent effect in the treatment of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. [References: 19]

Immunohistochemical overexpression of cyclin D1 was determined in paraffin-embedded specimens from diagnostic biopsies of 89 primary cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), using a polyclonal antiserum. The tumor response rates were estimated after curative treatment (i.e. surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Patients whose tumors were overexpressing cyclin D1 showed complete or partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-FU. In addition, a majority of cyclin D1 negative tumors did not respond at all to this treatment (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). This study indicates that immunohistochemical assessment of cyclin D1 expression in SCCHN could be a new predictive marker to select a subgroup of patients that will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy

Over 100 patients were treated using this system, which is fitted to a Clinac 600C linac. Both cranial and extracranial lesions have been treated using this modality. Immobilization is achieved either with the Talon system for cranial sites or an Aquaplast cast. Target volumes up to 500 cm3 have been treated. Multiple lesions (up to 3) were treated in one setup. The range of dose/fractionation schemes used was 15 Gy/1 fx (radiosurgical treatment) - 80 Gy/40 fx. Dose validation studies were carried out using film and ion chamber dosimetry in a specially designed phantom. Optimal dose distributions were attainable using inverse treatment planning for IMRT delivery. These were found to encompass the target volumes accurately using dose validation phantom studies. Immobilization methods used were accurate to within 1 mm, as evidenced by daily portal films. IMRT using the Peacock system offers the advantage of delivery of conformal therapy to high doses safely and accurately. This provides the opportunity for dose escalation studies, retreatment of previously treated tumors, as well as treating multiple targets in one setup. The system may be fitted to a conventional linac without major modifications

Both radical surgical removal and high-dose radiation therapy, particularly proton beam therapy, reportedly are effective in tumor control and improve survival rates. The authors posit that these tumors are best treated with radical surgery and proton-photon beam therapy. During the last 5 years, they treated 25 patients (15 females and 10 males) who harbored pathologically diagnosed skull base chordomas. The mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range 8-61 years). Previous surgery or radiation therapy was performed at other institutions in seven and two patients, respectively. The authors performed 33 surgical procedures on 23 patients. Radical removal (defined as absence of residual tumor on operative inspection and postoperative imaging) was achieved in 10 patients; subtotal resection (defined as resection of > 90% of the tumor) was achieved in 11 patients; and partial resection (defined as resection of < 90% of the tumor) was achieved in two patients. Radical surgical removal included not only the excision of soft-tumor tissue, but also extensive drilling of the adjacent bone. Adjuvant therapy consisted of postoperative combined proton-photon beam therapy (given to 17 patients and planned for one patient) and conventional radiation therapy (two patients); three patients received no adjunct therapy. To date, four patients have died. One patient who had undergone previous surgery and sacrifice of the internal carotid artery died postoperatively from a massive stroke; one patient died from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without evidence of recurrence; and two patients died at 25 and 39 months of recurrent tumor. Permanent neurological complications included third cranial nerve palsy (one patient) and hemianopsia (one patient); radiation necrosis occurred in three patients. Of the 21 patients followed for more than 3 months after surgery, 16 have had no evidence of recurrence and five (including the two mortalities noted above) have had recurrent tumors (four diagnosed clinically and one radiologically). The mean disease-free interval was 14.4 months. A longer follow-up period will, hopefully, support the early indication that radical surgical removal and postoperative proton-photon beam therapy is an efficacious treatment. The use of skull base approaches based on the tumor classification introduced in this paper is associated with low mortality and morbidity rates

Despite this aggressive strategy, there are few long-term survivors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging method that can monitor metabolic changes in brain tumours. To date there is little data concerning the prognostic significance of the evolving spectral alterations during a course of radiotherapy. MATERIALS: We report herein a prospective study of patients with HGGs undergoing post-operative radiotherapy. Fourteen consecutively eligible patients with a confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant glioma and completion of all required MRS imaging were included in this study. All patients had MRS imaging prior to radiotherapy, at week 4 of radiotherapy, and 2 months post-treatment. T1 and T2 weighted images as well as post-gadolinium multi-voxel proton MRS images were obtained. Normalized (tumour metabolite/normal brain metabolite) levels of choline, NAA, creatine, lipid and lactate were calculated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of progression-free and overall survival were constructed based on the evolving patterns of metabolite changes over the course of the images. RESULTS: The mean tumour choline/NAA ratio decreased over the course of therapy, with a reduction observed between the baseline and post-radiotherapy studies (1.91 vs. 1.29, P=0.049). A similar decrease was identified with the mean normalized choline ratio, with a highly significant difference observed between the baseline and post-radiation images (1.61 vs. 0.96, P=0.001). Patients who exhibited more than 40% decrease in normalized choline between the week 4 and post-radiotherapy studies were associated with unfavourable survival (logrank test, P=0.003) and disease progression (logrank test, P=0.012). The Lactate/NAA ratio at the 4th week of radiotherapy and the change in normalized choline/creatine between baseline and week 4 of radiotherapy were also predictive of outcome suggesting the possibility of adaptive, response-based radiation treatment. Patients with two or more poor prognostic MRS indices had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with zero or one poor indices, with 15% and 68% at 1 year, respectively (logrank test, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The evolving pattern of spectral changes over the course of radiotherapy, in particular those associated with choline-containing compounds, appears to be prognostic of tumour response and outcome. Based on our data, a decision point may exist in the mid course of radical radiotherapy, at which time consideration of the choline levels could indicate the extent of radiotherapeutic response, thus allowing for individualized treatment modification

Eight patients (seven males and one female) were suffering from over-irradiation syndrome as a result of treatments from a malfunctioning linear electron accelerator. The mean accidental estimated dose was 136 Gy delivered to the "open-neck" (seven cases) and to the thoracic wall (one case), during a mean of 5.4 sessions (range 1-9 sessions). Paresthesia and weakness in the upper extremities were the earliest symptoms (87.5 %), with evolution to paralysis in all patients. No patient is alive (mean survival time 64 days). In all cases MRI was negative for neurologic lesions in the acute phase ( < 90 days from irradiation; Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system). Late signs of radiation myelitis manifested as high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images in three patients, and as Gd-DTPA enhancement of T1-weighted images in one case. Autopsies performed on four patients who died in acute phase showed morphologic alterations in white matter: edema in 75 %, and necrosis and glial reaction as well as obliterative vasculitis in all cases. In cases of over-irradiation, MRI may be normal in acute phase even if the patients have severe neurologic deficit, as positive MRI findings appear only in delayed radiation myelitis

The calculation used 13 monodirectional monoenergetic neutron beams in the energy range 10(-9) to 20 MeV, under three different source irradiation configurations: anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior and left lateral. Dose calculations were performed for 18 selected organs of the body, for which the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the International Commission on Radiological Units and Measurements have set tissue weighting factors for the determination of the effective dose. Another set of neutron-fluence-to-effective-dose conversion coefficients was also calculated with the proposed modification wR from ICRP Publication 92. From comparison between the dose results calculated and the data reported for the MIRD and VIPMAN models, it can be concluded that, although some discrepancies exist between the Zubal model and the two other models, there is good agreement in the left lateral irradiation geometry

Single voxel magnetic resonance (MR) spectral data were acquired from 8 normal volunteers, 16 patients with cervical cancer before radiation therapy, and 18 patients with cervical cancer after radiation therapy using an external pelvic coil at a 1.5-T on a Signa system. The presence or absence of various resonances within each spectrum was evaluated for similarities within each patient group and for spectral differences between groups. Resonances corresponding to lipid and creatine dominated the spectrum for the eight normal volunteers without detection of a choline resonance. Spectra from 16 pretreatment patients with biopsy-proven cervical cancer revealed strong resonances at a chemical shift of 3.25 ppm corresponding to choline. Data acquired from the 18 posttreatment setting studies was variable, but often correlated well with the clinical findings. Biopsy confirmation was obtained in seven patients. H1 MRS of the cervix using a noninvasive pelvic coil consistently demonstrates reproducible spectral differences between normal and neoplastic cervical tissue in vivo. However, signal is still poor for minimal disease recurrence. Further study is needed at intervals before, during, and after definitive irradiation with biopsy confirmation to validate the accuracy of MRS in distinguishing persistence or recurrence of disease from necrosis and fibrosis

For this and other reasons, robots were incorporated into the treatment room systems at MPRI. METHODS: The Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute (MPRI) is the first radiotherapy facility in the United States to use commercial robots with six degrees of freedom for patient positioning, rather than a traditional bed with four degrees of freedom. RESULTS: This paper outlines the ways in which robots are used at MPRI and attempts to distil insights from the experience of treating over 200 radiotherapy patients with a robotic system from February 2004 to late 2006. CONCLUSIONS: The system has performed well, and with great reliability, but there is room for future improvement, especially in ease of use and in reducing the time to get patients into position.

Risk factors are multifocal; therefore, total dose calculation is crucial. We evaluated the contribution of scatter radiation to obtain an accurate cumulative spinal cord dose. Twenty patients undergoing three field head and neck radiation by Cobalt or 6 MV Linac had a total cord dose calculated from direct and scatter radiation. The cord was removed from the radiation field at tumor doses no higher than 4,400 cGy. Total tumor dose ranged from 5,400-7,400 cGy (mean 6060). All patients achieved the prescribed dose and none were lost to follow up (mean 36 months). It was found that scatter radiation can contribute as much as 20% extra dose to the spinal cord. Mean extra dose was 9% (range 1%-20%). This additional dose ranged from 52-810 cGy (mean 339 cGy). No apparent difference was seen with Cobalt or Linac source. Our conclusion was that significant additional dose is delivered to the spinal cord by scatter radiation and that scatter may contribute more to the development of myelopathy than previously believed

The theoretical considerations about the clinical advantages this treatment modality can yield and the results obtained at the centers where it has already been used justify the proposal to project a center of this kind also in our Country. To this purpose, two of the authors of this paper (U. Amaldi, G. Tosi) founded the TERA Group formed by physicists, engineers and radiotherapists who work in close collaboration on a feasibility study for a hadrontherapy facility. The first aim of the Hadrontherapy Project is to design a center equipped with a synchrotron which, at the beginning, will accelerate negative hydrogen ions (H-) which will first produce 70-250 MeV proton beams and, then accelerate light ions (up to 16O) to 430 MeV/amu. This accelerator will serve four or five treatment rooms where patients can be irradiated simultaneously. Two rooms will be equipped with a fixed horizontal beam for the treatment of eye, head and neck tumors; the others will be equipped with rotating gantries to administer, in any clinical situation, really adequate treatment. Such a unit, when enough experience is fained, will allow at least 1000 patients to be treated yearly. The synchrotron injector will be designed so as to allow, parallel to the radiotherapy activities, other applications of medical and biological interest such as: the production of radioisotopes for diagnostic use (especially positron emitters), the analysis of trace elements through the PIXE technique and the production of thermal and epithermal neutrons for boron neutron capture therapy.

METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with stage II or III esophageal carcinoma without contraindication against operation and chemoradiotherapy, were randomly divided into two groups: combined group (Group A) 48 and control group (Group B) 49. Patients in group A were given neoadjuvant treatment consisted of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin for 2 cycles and radiotherapy of DT36 Gy/12 f/17 d. Three weeks later, operation was performed. Patients in group B were given operation alone. Survival rate was calculated with Kaplan-Meier method. Chi and Log-rank test was used to assess the difference between the two groups. RESULTS: The radical resectability of group A and group B were 85.4% and 65.3% (P = 0.018 1). The lymph node metastasis rate of the two groups were 21.7% and 45.7% (P = 0.019 4). The T stage of group A was significantly lowered (P = 0.003 6). The local and regional recurrence rate of two groups were 34.8% and 58.7% (P = 0.023 6), while there was no significant difference in operative complications between the two groups. Significant improvement in the long-term survival rate was observed in group A, especially in patients who achieved partial and complete response with high 5-year survival rate of 56.5%. CONCLUSION: Preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is able to reduce the tumor and tumor stage, lower the lymph node metastasis rate and local or regional recurrence rate, also it can improve radical resectability and long-term survival without increasing the operative complications	
0	2262	Effects of preconceptional irradiation on mortality and cancer incidence in the offspring of patients given injections of Thorotrast.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Breast, Case-Control Studies, Contrast Media, Denmark/ep [Epidemiology], Fathers, Female, Humans, Incidence, Injections, Lung, Male, Maternal Exposure/ae [Adverse Effects], Melanoma, Methods, Mortality, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Paternal Exposure/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Registries, Research, Risk, Skin, Societies, Testis, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: Findings from a British case-control study suggest that a preconceptional paternal external radiation dose of more than 100 mSv (10 rem) is significantly related to risk for leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in offspring. The suggestion, however, has not been supported by experimental or other epidemiologic studies. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate if preconceptional irradiation of males and females from internally deposited radionuclides affects mortality and risk of developing cancer in their offspring. METHODS: The offspring of 260 females (n = 143) and 320 males (n = 226) who lived longer than 1 year after receiving Thorotrast (a compound no longer in use) for cerebral arteriography were studied for mortality rate and the risk for developing cancer. Thorotrast was used as a contrast medium containing a 20% colloidal solution of thorium dioxide-Th 232, an alpha particle-emitting radionuclide, which is retained lifelong in nearly all organs. The offspring of the exposed patients were identified by manual linkage with the municipal population registers and followed-up for vital status by computerized linkage with the Danish National Central Population Registry and for incidence of cancer by computerized linkage with the Danish National Cancer Registry. The standardized mortality/morbidity ratios (SMRs) for death and for site-specific incidence of cancer in the offspring were calculated as ratios of the observed rates in the study population to the expected rates in the general population. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 40 years, four cases of cancer (breast [one], uterine cervix [one], melanoma of skin [one], and retinoblastoma [one]) versus 2.9 cases expected, developed among 143 children born to mothers who received injections of Thorotrast (SMR = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-3.5), while six cases of cancer (one case each of cancer of lung, testis, thyroid, and Hodgkin's lymphoma and two cases of melanoma of skin), versus 4.5 expected, occurred among 226 children of exposed fathers (SMR = 1.3; 95% CI = 0.5-2.9). No case of leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in any of the offspring studied. Mortality was lower than expected both for children of exposed mothers (SMR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.3-1.5) and of exposed fathers (SMR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the previously proposed association between parental exposure to radiation and the risk of childhood leukemia and lymphoma. Furthermore, since mortality from all causes was not increased in any offspring, our results do not support the belief that preconceptional parental low-dose exposure to alpha radiation increases the incidence of cancer or mortality in the offspring

We review our experience of acoustic tumor treatments at one institution using a gamma knife for SRS and the first commercial world installation of a dedicated linac for SRT. METHODS: Patients were treated with SRS on the gamma knife or SRT on the linac from October 1994 through August 2000. Gamma knife technique involved a fixed-frame multiple shot/high conformality single treatment, whereas linac technique involved daily conventional fraction treatments involving a relocatable frame, fewer isocenters, and high conformality established by noncoplanar arc beam shaping and differential beam weighting. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were treated on the gamma knife, and 56 patients were treated on the linac, with 1 NF-2 patient common to both units. Three patients were lost to follow-up, and in the remaining 122 patients, mean follow-up was 119 +/- 67 weeks for SRS patients and 115 +/- 96 weeks for SRT patients. Tumor control rates were high (> or =97%) for sporadic tumors in both groups but lower for NF-2 tumors in the SRT group. Cranial nerve morbidities were comparably low in both groups, with the exception of functional hearing preservation, which was 2.5-fold higher in patients who received conventional fraction SRT. CONCLUSION: SRS and SRT represent comparable noninvasive treatments for acoustic schwannomas in both sporadic and NF-2 patient groups. At 1-year follow-up, a significantly higher rate of serviceable hearing preservation was achieved in SRT sporadic tumor patients and may therefore be preferable to alternatives including surgery, SRS, or possibly observation in patients with serviceable hearing

[German]	Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radium, Risk, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Since April 1983 patients with gynecologic tumors have been irradiated with the HDR afterloading method at the University Hospital of Cologne. The therapy scheme for the carcinoma of the cervix consists of a combination of intracavitary contact irradiation and external radiotherapy. Brachytherapy is preponderant in an early stage of tumor extension, whereas teletherapy contributes more to the total dose in advanced stages. At first, the pelvis is totally exposed to a homogenous irradiation, so the shrunken tumor can more easily be arrived by curietherapy. The therapy scheme is described for the different tumor stages with its dosages, fractionations, and treatment pauses. Besides the use of special multiple-way applicators, the risk organs are protected by collimating with a block the middle part of the external irradiation field as soon as the maximum permissible dose is reached. A special block shape minimizes the dose irregularities at the field borders. The total physical dose at point A is about 60 Gy. The high dose rate of HDR afterloading has to be considered when calculating the biologic efficient dose. Here the dose rate factor furnishes a rough relation to the established radium dosage

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report dosimetric results for 72 cases of mycosis fungoides, using similar irradiation techniques on two different linear accelerators. All patients were treated using a modified Stanford 6-field technique. In vivo TLD was done on all patients, and the data for all patients treated on both machines was collected into a database for analysis. Means and standard deviations (SDs) were computed for all locations. Scatter plots of doses vs. height, weight, and obesity index were generated, and correlation coefficients with these variables were computed. RESULTS: The TLD results show that our current TSEB implementation is dosimetrically equivalent to the previous implementation, and that our beam calibration technique and monitor unit calculation is accurate. Correlations with obesity index were significant at several sites. Individual TLD results allow us to customize the boost treatment for each patient, in addition to revealing patient positioning problems and/or systematic variations in dose caused by patient variability. The data agree well with previously published TLD results for similar TSEB techniques. CONCLUSION: TLD is an important part of the treatment planning and quality assurance programs for TSEB, and routine use of TLD measurements for TSEB is recommended

In this study the effectiveness of "high dose intravenous immunoglobulin" (IVIG) in Graves' ophthalmopathy treatment is explored. 11 patients were treated with orbital radiotherapy combined with systemic corticosteroid (Group 1), while 10 patients were treated with the combination of orbital irradiation and IVIG (Group 2). The therapeutic effect was assessed by an ophthalmopathy index based on the American Thyroid Association, classification of ocular changes of Graves' ophthalmopathy. All signs and symptoms of endocrine ophthalmopathy improved significantly in both groups. The mean ophthalmopathy index decreased from 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 3.4 +/- 1.5 in Group 1, and from 7.0 +/- 1.8 to 3.0 +/- 2.1 in Group 2. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between Group 1 and 2 mean initial and final ophthalmopathy index, and a significant difference between initial and final ophthalmopathy index both in Group 1 and 2. While side effects were present in Group 1 treated with systemic corticosteroid, no side effect was observed in patients treated with IVIG. These preliminary results suggest that IVIG is safe and effective in the treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 53 intracranial AVMs treated between 1991-1998. HFSR was selected for 26 AVMs with a maximum diameter > or 2.5 cm or at eloquent area. Twenty-seven patients were treated with SRS (18 AVMs < 2.5 cm at non-eloquent area, nine patients who were unfit for prolonged ring-wearing). The most frequent minimum dose (Dmin) was 20 Gy for SRS and 28 Gy for HFSR in four fractions. The mean follow-up duration was 34.6 months for SRS and 35.4 months for HFSR. RESULTS: As a whole, the 3 and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 64 and 92%. Age <20 years old (P=0.02) and a maximum diameter <2 cm were favorable factors (P=0.05). A difference in the distribution of patients was observed in size (> or =2.5 cm or not) (P<0.001) and location (eloquent or not) (P<0.001) between SRS and HFSR due to the treatment selection. However, no significant differences were observed in the actuarial rates of obliteration and transient increased signals with T2-weighted MR images between SRS and HFSR. Radiation necrosis occurred in two patients treated with SRS and in none with HFSR. Intracranial hemorrhage after treatment happened in two treated with SRS and three with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: HFSR appears to be at least as effective as SRS in achieving complete obliteration of intracranial AVM, although its definitive role remains to be investigated

The evolution of childhood CNS malignancy following therapy is reviewed to identify radiation response variables indicating where the proton dose distribution will improve the therapeutic ratio. The review documents that of the 1262 children expected to develop CNS malignancy in 1989, only 43% will survive 5 years. About 75% of those with medulloblastoma and over 90% with astrocytoma die from persistent (in-field) disease. When the patient has been treated with radiation, it is accepted that disease persistence indicates the cancer dose was insufficient. Potentially 536 children could show an improved incidence of local control and improved survival from an increased cancer dose available from proton irradiation. As the total dose and volume of brain irradiated is increased about 1800 cGy, brain dysfunction increases, producing a spectrum of functional and intellectual deficits which are age and volume related. About 900 irradiated patients would have fewer in-field histologic and functional changes if the dose to normal brain, or the volume of brain irradiated, is reduced by an improved dose distribution. A proton beam treatment plan, delivering a cancer dose of 7400 cGy, is simulated for a thalamic astrocytoma. The dose distribution of this plan is compared with an x-ray plan used to treat a patient, in which a dose of 5400 cGy was delivered to the astrocytoma. Comparative isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms indicate a decreased integral dose to normal brain and a decreased volume of normal brain irradiated, even as the cancer dose is boosted 2000 cGy with protons	
1	157	What is the role of radiation in the treatment of subfoveal membranes: review of radiobiologic, pathologic, and other considerations to initiate a multimodality discussion.

All schedules successfully controlled membrane progression, stabilized vision in most patients, and increased visual acuity in some. Conformal protons also decreased the radiation dose to healthy tissues outside the designated volume (16 mm in diameter). It appears that radiation therapy could be useful and cost-effective, but neither the optimal time-dose schedule single or multiple dose fractions nor the type of radiation proton conformal beam or x-ray therapy are defined. METHODS: By means of an extensive literature survey, we reviewed the rationale for using radiation to treat subfoveal neovascularization, examined a paradigm of radiation interaction with tissue, reviewed the histopathology of neovascular membranes, and documented the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of the disease. Accepting that the eye is an extracranial brain extension, and that its microvasculature has properties similar to brain microvessels, we reviewed the radiobiologic response of brain microvessels. We also revisited the controversy concerning the efficacy of single-dose-fraction vs. multifraction schedules. RESULTS: This paper outlines parameters within which radiation therapy's role might be defined, and proposes a clinical radiation-biology scoring program to evaluate radiation effects, based on the SOMA concept. CONCLUSION: A prospective, controlled clinical trial is feasible and is indicated to determine radiation therapy's role in managing the proliferative component of age-related macular degeneration.

Nonradioactive Au grains were used as the markers and produced sufficiently clear images. The procedure consists of implanting the markers with a specially designed injector for endoscopic, palpative and intraoperative approaches to the lesions, which was performed without any adverse effects. Due to application of this procedure, the accuracy of treatment planning and pinpointing the site of the treatment field has improved greatly

Taking the peak skin score as an endpoint, the radiobiological effects [relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and time-dose relationships] of the proton beam in multi-fractionated treatments were estimated. Factors influencing the skin dose, such as the prescribed tumor dose, tumor site, and number of applied fields, were also analyzed. The following conclusions regarding acute skin reactions to the clinical use of proton irradiation were obtained: 1) the physical skin-sparing effect of proton irradiation in single-field irradiation, especially in superficial regions, is not large compared with that of high-energy photon irradiation; 2) multidirectional proton irradiation significantly reduced the skin dose and severity of acute reactions; 3) the radiobiological effects of the proton beam, RBE and the time factor, estimated in human skin in multi-fractional treatment were slightly smaller than those of X-rays, i.e., 0.92 and -0.25 +/- 0.09, respectively

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

Although this emotional syndrome has been seen in association with several different pathological entities, review of the literature failed to identify its occurrence as the only clinical expression of angiographically occult brainstem vascular malformation, or as a solitary symptom in any disease. Our data suggest that pathological laughing and crying can occur without any other manifestation of pseudobulbar palsy. An attempt is made to correlate this patient's clinical and radiological findings. This case was treated by stereotactic Bragg-peak proton beam therapy

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In gastrointestinal cancers, it is assessed that at least 345 patients, mainly non-resectable rectal cancers, oesophageal and liver cancers, are eligible. Great uncertainties do however exist both in the number of patients with gastrointestinal cancers suitable for radiation therapy, and in the proportion of those where proton beams may give sufficiently better results

These measurements were carried out to monitor the long-term exposure of these potentially toxic trace elements through hand bone levels. The dose equivalent delivered to a patient during irradiation procedure is the limiting factor for IVNAA measurements. This article describes a method to estimate the average radiation dose equivalent delivered to the patient's hand during irradiation. The computational method described in this work augments the dose measurements carried out earlier [Arnold et al., 2002. Med. Phys. 29(11), 2718-2724]. This method employs the Monte Carlo simulation of hand irradiation facility using MCNP4B. Based on the estimated dose equivalents received by the patient hand, the proposed irradiation procedure for the IVNAA measurement of manganese in human hands [Arnold et al., 2002. Med. Phys. 29(11), 2718-2724] with normal (1 ppm) and elevated manganese content can be carried out with a reasonably low dose of 31 mSv to the hand. Sixty-three percent of the total dose equivalent is delivered by non-useful fast group (> 10 keV); the filtration of this neutron group from the beam will further decrease the dose equivalent to the patient's hand

Figures for local tumor control varied from 26-76% after 2 years to 19% after 10 years and for survival from 16-46% after 2 years to 14% after 10 years. Results of all studies were consistent with showing an increased incidence of severe late effects. Eligibility criteria with regard to the tumor stage, history, and previous therapies of relapses varied from study to study. Also, physical treatment parameters, such as neutron energy, LET and OER, neutron and photon doses for one fraction and for the total radiotherapy were rather different. The benefit of neutron therapy in comparison with photons was low or non-existent when smaller tumor stages, such as primaries T2 or lymph nodes N1 were included into the trial. It increased when only T4 tumors, recurrences or tumors persisting after conventional radiotherapy were treated and when the percentage of fixed lymph nodes increased. There was only one European study in which patients suffering form lymph node metastases of the neck had, in contrast to American data (Griffin et al. 1978), a worse prognosis after neutrons than after photon therapy (Duncan et al. 1987b). In our own phase II study on reactor neutron therapy of 100 patients suffering from relapses and persistent tumors, not yet published, 3-year survival of 21% and 3-year local control of 32% were obtained. Although this was not a randomized study, during this period all patients with equivalent tumors treated by photon therapy alone died within 2 years. In conclusion there is no general indication for neutron therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, but there is a benefit of neutrons in palliative treatment of recurrences, necrotic and hypoxic primaries and lymph nodes.

The local disease was controlled in 111 of these patients. This study reviews the 26 patients who have had their disease recur, and who have evaluable diagnostic studies to examine for probable causes of recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The histologies of the recurrent tumors were 21 non-chondroid chordomas, two chondroid chordomas, and three chondrosarcomas. The prescribed doses ranged from 67 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 72 CGE (average of 69 CGE). Doses to small regions of the tumor were deliberately reduced where they abutted certain normal tissues (brain stem, spinal cord, optic chiasm, and optic nerves) in order to keep these structures at acceptance dose levels. The first study, CT or MR scan, on which there was evidence of increase in tumor was carefully evaluated and that volume transferred to the CT scan on which the treatment plan had been developed. The 3D dose distribution in the region of recurrence was carefully analyzed and a judgement made as to the most probable cause of recurrence. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter (6 of 26) of the cases failed in the prescribed dose region. More than half (15 of 26) failed in regions where tumor dose was limited by normal tissue constraints. Approximately 10% of the patients recurred in the surgical pathway and 10% were judged to be marginal misses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 75% of the patients failed in regions receiving less than the prescribed dose. All tumors which failed in the high dose region had volume greater than 75 cc. Patients with cervical spine disease had a higher rate of recurrence (10 or 26) and larger tumors (average volume of 102 cc) than those with base of skull disease (16 of 115) with an average volume of 63 cc

In the majority of cases, it occurs against a background of hepatitis B or C viral infection and/or liver cirrhosis, and is associated with a dismal prognosis of a few months. Current treatments in routine clinical practice are surgical resection and liver transplantation, but these therapies are applicable to only a small proportion of patients and prolongation of survival is restricted. Other treatment options include intra-arterial chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation, percutaneous ethanol injection, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, proton therapy, or a wide range of their possible combinations. The current lack of definitive data, however, limits the use of these therapies. Another option is gene therapy, which although in its infancy at the present time, may have a significant role to play in the future management of hepatocellular carcinoma. [References: 108]

To be able to fully utilize the advantages of these techniques correct patient positioning is an important prerequisite. This study employing an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) investigated the positioning uncertainties that occur in the pelvic region for different patient positioning devices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 patients with prostate cancer were irradiated with or without rectal balloon/pelvic mask at a linear accelerator with multileaf collimator (MLC). For each patient multiple portal images were taken from different directions and compared to the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) of the treatment planning system and to simulation films (Table 1, Figure 1). RESULTS: In spite of different positioning devices, all patients showed comparable total positioning uncertainties of 4.0 mm (lateral), 4.5 mm (cranio-caudal) and 1.7 mm (dorso-ventral). The lateral positioning error was reduced for the pelvic mask patients while the cranio-caudal error increased (Table 2, Figure 2). A systematic and a random component sum up to the total positioning error, and a good estimate of the magnitudes of the two is possible from six to eight portal images (Figure 3). CONCLUSIONS: With a small number of portal images it is possible to find out the systematic and random positioning error of a patient. Knowledge of the random error can be used to resize the treatment margin which is clinically relevant since this error differs greatly for different patients (Figure 4). Image analysis with EPID is convenient, yet has some problems. For example, one only gets indirect information on the movement of the ventral rectum wall (Figure 5). The successful operation of positioning devices, although, needs further improvement--especially if one focuses on IMRT

Treatment has been performed using linear accelerator (6 Mev) or Co 60 unity in order to reach the deepest layer of mucosa lesions. Radiotherapy schedule consisted of 150-200 cGy daily fractions given 5 times/week (w) for 4-5 w in split-course. [References: 62]

Some commonly used formulas for predicting risk are based on extrapolation from small numbers of animal experiments, pilot human treatment series, and theoretical radiobiological considerations. The authors studied the incidence of complications after AVM radiosurgery in relation to dose, volume, and other factors in a large patient series. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in 1329 patients with AVM treated by Dr. Raymond Kjellberg at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between 1965 and 1993. Dose and volume were obtained from HCL records, and information about patient follow up was derived from concurrent clinical records, questionnaires, and contact with referring physicians. Multivariate logistic regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals was used. Follow up was available in 1250 patients (94%); the median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. The median radiation dose was 10.5 Gy and the median treatment volume was 33.7 cm(3). Twenty-three percent of treated lesions were smaller than 10 cm(3). Fifty-one permanent radiation-related deficits occurred (4.1%). Of 1043 patients treated with a dose predicted by the Kjellberg isoeffective centile curve to have a less than 1% complication risk, 1.8% suffered radiation-related complications. Actual complication rates were 4.7% for 128 patients treated at Kjellberg risk centile doses of 1 to 1.8%, and 34% for 61 patients treated at risk centile doses of 2 to 2.5%. The fitted logistic model showed that complication risk was related to treatment dose and volume, thalamic or brainstem location, and patient age. CONCLUSIONS: The Kjellberg isoeffective risk centile curve significantly underpredicted actual risks of permanent complications after proton beam radiosurgery for AVMs. Actual risks were best predicted using a model that accounted for treatment dose and volume, lesion location, and patient age

We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT

Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

Measurements were made on neck node metastases during the radiation treatment period in 47 patients. Tumors with a slow regression rate were shown to have a high probability of recurrence. The results indicate that accurate measurements of the regression rate provide prognostic information, which is obtained early enough for the radiotherapist to consider additional treatment

The purpose of this study was to describe an alternative technique for orbital exenteration and its specific advantages over traditional methods. METHODS: A retrospective analysis at a tertiary care referral center was performed. Three patients with sinonasal malignancy (two cases) and fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis (one case) are reported. Intraconal involvement was evident in all patients by imaging and surgical pathology. Advanced endoscopic techniques in conjunction with image guidance and soft-tissue shaver technology were used for resection in all cases. RESULTS: The orbit was successfully exenterated via an eyelid-sparing endoscopic approach with minimal blood loss in all three patients. Exenteration was completed within 30-45 minutes. Uninvolved superior and lateral orbital periosteum was preserved in all patients, which permitted cavity "mucosalization" within 8 weeks. Two patients are alive without disease at 15-month follow-up. One patient with persistent cavernous sinus malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor died 4 months after resection despite proton beam therapy. CONCLUSION: This preliminary experience showed endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration to be an effective technique for exenteration of the orbit. Endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration offers two critical advantages: (1) direct transnasal control of the ophthalmic artery as it emerges from the optic foramen and (2) the ability to preserve the uninvolved superior and lateral periorbita. This can facilitate mucosal coverage of the exenterated space and obviate the need for tissue grafts and/or packing. Additionally, intraorbital pathology can be better visualized and blood loss and operative time are minimized. This technique may serve as an important adjunct for management of the orbit in patients with sinonasal malignancy or invasive fungal rhinosinusitis

Proton beams and stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) can be used to tailor the dose to nonspherical targets, as most tumors of the brain are irregularly shaped. Comparative planning of brain lesions using either proton or stereotactically guided photon beams was done to assess the institution's clinically available modality for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For the photon treatment, multiple stereotactically guided uniform intensity beams from a linear accelerator were used, each conformed to a projection of the planning target volume (PTV) by a mMLC. Proton beams were delivered from an isocentrically mounted gantry, using the spot-scanning technique and energy modulation. Seven patients were scanned in a stereotactic frame; target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) were delineated with the help of MR images. Four different lesions were selected: (1) concave, (2) ellipsoid isolated, (3) superficial and close to an organ at risk, and (4) irregular complex. Dose distributions in the PTV and critical structures were calculated using three-dimensional treatment-planning systems, followed by both a quantitative (by dose--volume histogram and conformity index) and qualitative (visual inspection) assessment of the plans. RESULTS: A high degree of conformation was achieved with a mMLC and stereotactic uniform intensity beams with comparable conformity indices to protons for 5 out of 7 plans, especially for superficial or spherical lesions. In the cases studied, the conformity index was better for protons than for photons for complex or concave lesions, or when the PTV was in the neighborhood of critical structures. CONCLUSION: The results for the cases studied, show that for simple geometries or for superficial lesions, there is no advantage in using protons. However, for complex PTV shapes, or when the PTV is in the vicinity of critical structures, protons seem to be potentially better than the fixed-field photon technique

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose plans of 6 stereotactically treated patients were recalculated for IMSRT by use of the same field setup and an inverse planning algorithm. Proton and IMPT plans were calculated anew. Three different tumor shapes, multifocal, ovoid, and irregular, were analyzed, as well as dose to organs-at-risk (OAR) in the vicinity of the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distributions were calculated from beam-setup data for a manual mMLC for stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy (SCRT), a dynamic mMLC for IMSRT, the spot-scanning technique for protons, and a modified spot-scanning technique for IMPT. SCRT was included for a part of the comparison. Criteria for assessment were PTV coverage, dose-volume histograms (DVH), volumes of specific isodoses, and the dose to OAR. RESULTS: Dose conformation to the PTV is equally good for all three techniques and tumor shapes considered. The volumes of the 90% and 80% isodose were comparable for all techniques. For the 50% isodose volume, a divergence between the two modes was seen. In 3 cases, this volume is smaller for IMSRT, and in the 3 other cases, it is smaller for IMPT. This difference was even more pronounced for the volumes of the 30% isodose; IMPT shows further improvement over conventional protons. OAR in concavities (e.g., the brainstem) were similarly well spared by protons and IMSRT. IMPT spares critical organs best. Fewer proton beams are required to achieve similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of intensity modulation improves the conformality of mMLC-based SCRT. Conformation of dose to the PTV is comparable for IMSRT, protons, and IMPT. Concerning the sparing of OAR, IMSRT is equivalent to IMPT, and IMPT is superior to conventional protons. The advantage of protons lies in the lower integral dose

Endoresection of the tumour after proton beam irradiation, is an alternative approach, aiming to reduce the incidence of ocular morbidity caused by tumour necrosis after sole radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with large uveal melanomas (mean tumour thickness: 9.1 mm, mean tumour volume: 0.77 cc), received a primary proton beam irradiation (60 CGE) and underwent subsequent endoresection via a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The median pretreatment visual acuity was 0.2. The mean follow-up was 13.9 months. RESULTS: The postoperative visual acuity after 12 months was 0.12 (median, mean visual acuity loss 0.08). The probability of developing radiation retinopathy or papillopathy within the first year after treatment was 35% and 28% respectively and the probability of enucleation was 9% within the first postoperative year. No tumour recurrences were observed and 2 patients developed liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Endoresection following irradiation of large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or the fovea seems to be a useful and safe alternative to the traditional irradiation or enucleation. The incidence of complications following our approach seems to be lower when compared to radiation alone, where tumour necrosis is a substantial problem

Radiosurgery of brain metastases then started in centers all over the world, however, experiences with brain metastases of renal cell carcinoma are yet limited. The aim of this analysis is therefore to present the treatment results of radiosurgery of brain metastases. Furthermore, in this paper prognostic subgroups shall be defined, in order to establish guidelines for an optimal therapy strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiosurgery means stereotactically guided high-precision irradiation methods by extremely focussing ionizing radiation within the target volume as a single dose application. The characteristic steep dose decrease allows the selective destruction of small intracranial lesions, while the surrounding brain tissue is optimally protected. Two methods, Gamma Knife and stereotactic modified linear accelerator are clinically available. RESULTS: In larger studies from different groups all over the world, local tumor control rates from 85% to 95%, recurrence rates from 6% to 15% and side effects between 3% and 15% have been attained, independent of the system used. Prognostic factors, like volume of metastases < 10 ml, applied dose > 18 Gy, one or two metastases, absence of extracranial metastases, good patient performance with a Karnofsky score > 70%, primary treatment and more than one year between primary diagnosis and brain metastases showed a trend toward improved survival. Depending on the prognostic factors the median survival after radiosurgery ranged from 6 to 12 months. Retrospective comparison of radiosurgery and surgical series suggest that both modalities attain similar results. The dose can be applied with an accuracy of 0.3 mm. DISCUSSION: Based on these experiences, brain metastases can be treated by radiosurgery, primarily in patients with one or two metastases or in combination with whole brain irradiation as a boost in patients with more than two metastases. Furthermore with radiosurgery a new treatment modality exists to re-irradiate patients who have been failed after surgery or whole brain irradiation. [References: 36]

Characteristics of both techniques are described. With the Tubingen radiosurgery system a good adaptation of the dose distribution to spherical or oval target volumes with a steep dose gradient was achieved, whereas homogeneity and adaptation of the dose distribution to irregularly shaped targets were better with the Heidelberg conformation technique. The mechanical accuracy of the Tubingen floorstand system was 0.3 mm +/- 0.2 mm, and that of the Heidelberg mask fixation system < 1 mm. Both methods require similar total treatment times. Nine patients were treated by the Tubingen radiosurgery system. The results are compared with 12 patients treated by conformation radiotherapy in Heidelberg. In both patient groups no further tumour growth occurred. Four of 9 single dose treated patients developed side-effects, such as temporary trigeminal and facial paraesthesia hearing deterioration and oedema. In contrast, patients treated by fractionated radiotherapy showed no side-effects. Relating to the short follow-up the results indicate that single dose application has certain drawbacks for special indications. Further studies have to work out which method gives the best treatment results

The merits of water suppression by freeze drying or irradiation, and spectral simplification by spin-echo methods, are discussed. Well-resolved resonances for a range of low molecular weight metabolites such as lactate, 3-D-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, acetate, citrate, glucose, valine and formate were observed. Resonances for glutamine were observed only from freeze dried samples. Concentrations determined by n.m.r. were in reasonable agreement with those from conventional methods. The n.m.r. spectra of CSF were related to the clinical conditions of the subjects. No resonances for citrate were present in spectra of CSF from subjects (three infants) with bacterial meningitis; high lactate and lowered glucose levels were observed. Strong resonances for glucose and glycine were observed for mildly diabetic subjects. Both the aromatic and the aliphatic regions of the CSF spectra from subjects suffering from liver failure contained distinctive features characteristic for hepatic coma: Intense resonances for lactate, alanine, valine, methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine. In some cases guanine was also present, which does not appear to have been reported previously. The two-dimensional spectrum suggested the presence of abnormally high levels of a number of endogenous metabolites. Such assignments were not possible using one-dimensional spectra alone because of signal overlap

1	4558	TPD-based evaluation of near threshold mono-energetic proton energies for the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be production of neutrons for BNCT	Beryllium, Body Burden, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Computer Simulation, Differential Threshold, Engineering, Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Models,Biological, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time, Universities	An evaluation of mono-energetic proton energies ranging from 1.885 MeV to 1.920 MeV was carried out to determine the viability of these near threshold energies in producing neutrons for BNCT via the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction. Neutron fields generated at these proton energies were assessed using the treatable protocol depth (TPD) and the maximum TPD (TPD(max)) as evaluation indices. The heavy charged particle (HCP) dose rate to tumour was likewise applied as a figure of merit in order to account for irradiation time and required proton current. Incident proton energies closer to the reaction threshold generated deeper TPDs compared to higher energy protons when no boron dose enhancers (BDE) were placed in the irradiation field. Introducing a BDE resulted in improved TPDs for high proton energies but their achievable TPD(max) were comparatively lower than that obtained for lower proton energies. In terms of the HCP dose rate to tumour, higher proton energies generated neutron fields that yielded higher dose rates both at TPD(max) and at fixed depths of comparison. This infers that higher currents are required to deliver the prescribed treatment dose to tumours for proton beams with energies closer to the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction threshold and more achievable proton currents of around 10 mA or less for proton energies from 1.900 MeV and above. The dependence on incident proton energy of the TPD, TPD(max) and the HCP dose rate to tumour with respect to the (10)B concentration in tumour and healthy tissues were also clarified in this study. Increasing the (10)B concentration in tumour while maintaining a constant T/N ratio resulted in deeper TPD(max) where a greater change in TPD(max) was obtained for proton energies closer to the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction threshold. The HCP dose rates to tumour for all proton energies also went up, with the higher proton energies benefiting more from the increased (10)B concentration

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding

The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and the outcome of cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: To update clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with salivary gland malignant tumors previously validated in 1997. These recommendations cover diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with these tumors. METHODS: The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts who define the CPGs according to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project. Once the guidelines have been defined, the document is submitted for review by independent reviewers. RESULTS: This article presents the updated clinical practice guidelines concerning irradiation of patient with salivary gland tumors. The main recommendations are: 3 dimensional conformal radiotherapy (with or without intensity modulation) or 2D irradiation can be used; for surgical complete resected patients, postoperative photon radiotherapy should not be used in case of low grade stage I and 11 tumors(standard, level of evidence B2) but should be used for high grade stage II, II and IV tumors and for low grade stage III and IV tumors(standard, level of evidence B2). Neutron therapy should not be used in all of these cases (standard, level of evidence D); for patients presenting an incomplete macroscopic or microscopic surgical residual disease, postoperative irradiation must be delivered(standard). Neutron or photon therapy can be either delivered (options); for non operable patients neutron or photon therapy can be either delivered (options, level of evidence B2); for unresectable tumors or in case of recurrent neoplasms, exclusive neutron therapy or surgical tumor reduction combined with postoperative photon beam irradiation can be proposed (options, level of evidence C).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1992 and April 1993, 74 patients received external beam radiation treatment to the prostate +/- nodes, generally with a four-field box technique. Forty-four of the 74 patients had a custom-made hemibody foam cast used in an attempt to improve setup accuracy. A review of the routine weekly port films was performed following the completion of therapy to determine the reproducibility of patient setup in all 74 patients. The physician's request of an isocenter shift was used as an indicator of reproducibility. Neither the treating technologists nor the physicians knew at the time the films were taken that the port films would be reviewed for setup reproducibility at a later date. The results were compared between the patients treated with (44) and without (30) an immobilization device. RESULTS: In the 44 immobilized patients, 213 routine checks of the isocenter were performed during the 7-week course of radiation therapy. In 17.4% of these instances (37 out of 213), an isocenter shift was requested. This rate is compared to 23.1% (30 out of 130) in the 30 patients who did not have the immobilization device (p < 0.2). There was a statistically significant reduction in isocenter shifts requested in the anterior to posterior direction in the patients who were immobilized, 5.1% (9 out of 175) vs. 12.6% (13 out of 103) (p < 0.05, two tailed chi-square test). There was no significant improvement in the reproducibility of isocenter placement in the cephalad to caudal or right to left directions. CONCLUSIONS: This custom-made hemibody foam cradle appears to improve the reproducibility of patient setup during the 7-week course of fractionated external beam irradiation for patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This type of immobilization device is now routinely used in our clinic and is recommended for all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. These devices are likely to be particularly useful when contemplating dose escalation to minimize the volume of bladder and rectum included in the treatment fields	
0	706	A technique for respiratory-gated radiotherapy treatment verification with an EPID in cine mode	Aged, Algorithms, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Massachusetts, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Respiration, Time Factors, Uncertainty	Respiratory gating based on external surrogates is performed in many clinics. We have developed a new technique for treatment verification using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) in cine mode for gated 3D conformal therapy. Implanted radiopaque fiducial markers inside or near the target are required for this technique. The markers are contoured on the planning CT set, enabling us to create digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) for each treatment beam. During the treatment, a sequence of EPID images can be acquired without disrupting the treatment. Implanted markers are visualized in the images and their positions in the beam's eye view are calculated off-line and compared to the reference position by matching the field apertures in corresponding EPID and DRR images. The precision of the patient set-up, the placement of the beam-gating window, as well as the residual tumour motion can be assessed for each treatment fraction. This technique has been demonstrated with a case study patient, who had three markers implanted in his liver. For this patient, the intra-fractional variation of all marker positions in the gating window had a 95% range of 4.8 mm in the SI direction (the primary axis of motion). This was about the same (5 mm) as the residual motion considered in the planning process. The inter-fractional variation of the daily mean positions of the markers, which indicates the uncertainty in the set-up procedure, was within +8.3 mm/-4.5 mm (95% range) in the SI direction for this case

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

For these 30 cases, the diagnosis was made by B ultrasonography only when the volume of the extension was important, between 20 and 2280 mm3. The Cox model multi-variant analysis was used to study the statistically significant parameters in the development of an extrascleral extension. It appears that the maximal diameter of the intraocular tumor (p = 0.0012), the localisation of the anterior margin (p = 0.0304) and the age of the patients (p = 0.0097) are statistically meaningful. The 4 years' survival, studied with the Kaplan-Meier curves, is estimated at 60% for the patients with extrascleral extension and at 85% for the patients without. These results are similar to those of literature, whatever treatment is chosen (enucleation and radiotherapy, exenteration)

All patients had undergone a subtotal surgical resection. Twenty-three patients were treated definitively with charged particles, 13 patients were treated with photons and particles, and 9 patients were treated for recurrent disease. Total doses ranged from 36 to 80 Gray equivalent (GyE). Thirty-three patients are alive with a minimum followup of 1 year. The actuarial survival and local control for all patients at 5 years is 62% and 59%, respectively. Patients treated for primary disease had a 78% actuarial local control rate at 2 years, whereas the rate for patients with recurrent disease was 33%. Patients with smaller visible tumor volumes (less than 20 cc) had a significantly better local control rate than patients with larger tumor volumes (80% vs 33% actuarial rate at 5 years). Patients with chondrosarcoma had the highest local control rate, as did patients treated with particles alone. Complications included 3 patients with unilateral visual loss, two patients who became blind, and 4 patients with radiation injury to the brainstem

RIT can be used either to target tumor cells or to specifically suppress immunocompetent host cells in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. The choice of radionuclide used for RIT depends on its distinct radiation characteristics and the type of malignancy or cells targeted. Beta-emitters with their lower energy and longer path length are more suitable to target bulky, solid tumors whereas alpha-emitters with their high linear energy transfer and short path length are better suited to target hematopoietic cells (normal or malignant). Different approaches of RIT such as the use of stable radioimmunoconjugates or of pretargeting strategies are available. Encouraging results have been obtained with RIT in patients with hematologic malignancies. The results in solid tumors are somewhat less favorable but new strategies for patients with minimal residual disease using adjuvant and locoregional treatment are evolving. This report outlines basic principles of RIT, gives an overview of available radionuclides and radioimmunoconjugates, and discusses clinical results with special emphasis on their use in hematologic malignancies including use in conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation.

The authors present their preliminary results on 66 patients with nonsurgical intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The doses delivered for treatment varied from 20 to 70 Gy. Doses of no more than 40 Gy were used in 80% of patients. An angiographic study was performed when the computed tomographic scan controls showed relevant modifications of the lesion volume. Total obliteration was obtained in 27 of the 41 patients (65.8%) who were followed up for at least 24 months. The percentage of the cured patients is significantly higher when a) the entire malformation is included in the 75% isodose (96%) and b) the maximum diameter of the lesion is less than 12 mm (81%).

All of them were radiosurgically treated with a linear accelerator in stereotatic conditions (UMIC). The delivered doses vary from 20 gys to 50 gys. Thirty-seven were controlled angiographically and 35 of them showed the disappearence of the AVM. Different parameters can modify the results: delivered dose, the size and shape of the lesion, target-volume, peripheral lesion isodosis (75%), location, underestimation of the size or dose. These results show that small lesions are best to treat than larger ones, particularly because their volume enables us to encompass them more easily. The uniformity of this series is related to the homogenous size of the treated AVMs, thus avoiding the discussion of global, unclear, results. [References: 55]

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

Local tumor control and long-term palliation for both primary and metastatic tumors may be achieved with IMRT while reducing the risk of spinal cord toxicity associated with conventional radiotherapy techniques. In this article, we report our initial clinical experience in treating 16 paraspinal tumors with IMRT in which the planning target volume was 2 mm or greater from the spinal cord. METHODS: IMRT was administered by using a linear accelerator mounted with a multileaf collimator. Two immobilization body frames developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were used for patients with and without spinal implants. During a 30-month period, 16 patients underwent IMRT for metastatic and primary tumors. Eleven patients were treated for symptomatic recurrences after undergoing surgery and prior external beam radiotherapy, and one patient was treated after undergoing radiotherapy for a metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma with overlapping ports to the spine. Four patients with primary tumors were treated after primary resection that resulted in positive histological margins. Twelve patients were symptomatic with pain, functional radiculopathy, or both. Tumoral doses were determined on the basis of the relative radiosensitivity of tumors. Patients with metastatic tumors were administered a median tumoral dose of 20 Gy in four to five fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 6.0 Gy in addition to the full tolerance dose administered in previous radiation treatments. The primary tumors were delivered a median dose of 70 Gy in 33 to 37 fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 16 Gy. The median tumoral volume was 7.8 cm(3). RESULTS: Of the 15 patients who underwent radiographic follow-up, 13 demonstrated either no interval growth or a reduction in tumor size in a median follow-up period of 12 months (range, 2-23 mo). Two patients, one with a thoracic chondrosarcoma and one with a chordoma, showed tumor progression 1 year after undergoing IMRT. Pain symptoms improved in 11 of 11 patients, and 4 of 4 patients had significant improvement in their functionally significant radiculopathy and/or plexopathy. Pain relief was durable in all patients except the two with tumor progression. No patient showed signs or symptoms of radiation-induced myelopathy, radiculopathy, or plexopathy, including 12 patients with a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSION: IMRT was effective for treating pain and improving functional radiculopathy in patients with metastatic and primary tumors. Although long-term tumor control is not established in this study, high-dose tumoral irradiation can be performed without causing radiation myelopathy in more than 1 year of follow-up

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

Between June 1998 and July 2000, 27 patients were treated for benign lesions with radiosurgery using a 6-MV linear accelerator-based X-knife system and circular collimators. The lesions included schwannoma, meningioma, papillary cyst adenoma, and hemangioblastoma. Five patients had tissue diagnosis. The mean peripheral dose to the tumor margin was 12.8 Gy. The mean dose to the isocenter was 16.3 Gy. One to five isocenters were used to treat these lesions, with a mean of 10 arcs per isocenter and mean collimator size of 1.25 cm. Follow-up information was available on all patients, with a mean follow-up duration of 33 months. Six patients (22%) had improved symptoms and 21 (78%) had stable symptoms. Eight patients (30%) had regression of tumor and 19 had stable disease (70%). No patient had tumor progression, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade III or IV toxicity did not occur in any patients. In 3 patients (11%), RTOG grade I or grade II neurotoxicity developed. Of these, one patient had worsening of a preexisting VIIth nerve deficit that required temporary oral methylprednisolone, and in two patients a mild trigeminal deficit developed that did not require any medical intervention. Low-dose homogeneous radiosurgery using a linear accelerator is an effective treatment for benign intracranial tumors. If lower, more homogeneous radiation doses produce responses as durable as higher doses, then toxicity might be further reduced

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

[Review] [28 refs]	Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sweden	A Swedish group of oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that about 350 patients with lung cancer and about 20 patients with mesothelioma annually may benefit from proton beam therapy. [References: 28]

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that in paediatric cancers, proton beams are of potential importance in 80-100 children annually in Sweden. About 20 of the patients have medulloblastoma. The main purpose is to reduce late sequelae, but these are also increased chances to avoid myelosupression during e.g. concomitant chemo-radiation and to further intensify the chemotherapy.

The purpose of the intercomparison was to provide a basis for the exchange of dose-response data and to facilitate the involvement of Clatterbridge in collaborative clinical trials. Tissue-equivalent ionization chambers were used by the participants in each intercomparison to compare measurements of total (neutron plus gamma) absorbed dose in the host institution's neutron beam, following calibration of the chambers in a reference photon beam. The effects of differences in exposure standards, chamber responses in the neutron beams and protocol-dependent dosimetry factors were all investigated. It was concluded that the overall difference in the measurement of absorbed dose relative to that determined by the Clatterbridge group was less than 2%

Direct particle beam traversal of at least a portion of the lens usually is unavoidable in treatment of posterior intraocular tumors. The precise treatment planned for each patient permits quantitative assessment of the lenticular dose and its radiation quality. We are reporting our preliminary results on the development of helium-ion-induced lens opacifications and cataracts in 54 of these patients who had 10% or less of their lens in the treatment field. We believe these studies will be relevant to estimating the human risk for cataract in space flight

We present a study on five patients receiving loco-regional treatment for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose variation at the junction was measured with the patient dose verification system model TN-RD-50 (MOSFET system). Phantom measurements were performed to investigate the MOSFET accuracy in a half-field matching method and the influence of factors related to the accelerator. The aim of the patient measurements was to determine the effect of patient related factors on the dose at the junction over a period of 10 irradiation fractions. RESULTS: The MOSFET detector overestimates the dose in the junction area, therefore a correction factor was determined to correct the MOSFET results. Phantom measurements showed overdosages as well as underdosages, depending on the matching field direction (X or Y). Patient measurements showed dose values that deviated up to 133%+/-3% (2 S.D.). The average values of 10 irradiation sessions showed a continuous, almost linear, variation of dose value across the junction. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Significant dose deviations in the junction area average out over repeated treatments; (2) one individual measurement in the junction area should not lead to any action; (3) a linac QA procedure to check the dose at the junction line should simulate the clinical situation sufficiently; and (4) MOSFET dosimeters overestimate dose values in the penumbra region

The lymphocyte count was reduced to approximately 40 per cent at termination of treatment and remained below the pre-treatment level during a follow-up period of 18 months. The relative spontaneous cytotoxicity for 51Cr-labelled K562 cells, derived from a human myeloid leukemia, increased at completion of irradiation and remained elevated during the entire observation period. The relative cytotoxicity against Chang cells, derived from human liver, also seemed to increase but not to the same extent. The increments were probably due to an increased proportion of spontaneously cytotoxic cells bearing Fc-receptors for IgG which were significantly elevated after treatment. It was concluded that the changes differ from those occurring after local irradiation for breast carcinoma. The proportion of lymphoid tissue in relation to the blood volume which is included in the irradiated field may determine the changes of the blood lymphocyte population

Results of the first 42 treated tumors in 31 patients are presented. Most of the patients had solitary tumors in liver, lung or retroperitoneal space. Clinical target volumes ranged from 2 to 622 cm3 (mean 78 cm3) and minimum doses to the planning target volumes (PTV) of 7.7-30 Gy/fraction (mean 14.2 Gy) were given on 1-4 occasions to a total minimum dose to the PTVs of 7.7-45 Gy (mean 30.2 Gy) to the periphery of the PTV and total mean doses to the PTVs of 8-66 Gy (mean 41 Gy). The central part of the tumor was usually given about 50% higher dose compared to that of the periphery of the PTV by a planned inhomogeneous dose distribution. Some of the patients received stereotactic radiation therapy concomitantly to more than one target, in others new metastases were also treated which appeared during the follow-up period. We observed a local rate of no progressive disease of 80% during a follow-up period of 1.5-38 months. Fifty percent of the tumors decreased in size or disappeared

Due to the finite range and the sharpness of the dose gradients, the dose to well defined target volumes can be raised without excessive irradiation of non-target tissue. The prescribed proton doses are determined in part on the basis of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the particular radiation quality. In this study, RBE values were determined for a proton beam with a maximal range of 33 mm, which corresponds to an energy of approximately 67 MeV. The range modulated depth-dose distribution, with a 20 mm extended Bragg peak, was mainly designed for high precision treatment of small targets such as uveal melanomas. The tested cell lines, LS-174T and V79-379A, were chosen because of their suitability for clonogenic assays. The cells were irradiated with single doses in the range 2-10 Gy at different depths in the extended peak region of the range modulated proton beam. RBE values were determined by comparing the doses needed to obtain the same reduction in colony formation (0.5, 0.1 and 0.01) as with the reference 60Co gamma source. The mean RBE value was 1.22 with a standard deviation of 0.08. The variations depended on both cell type and on the survival levels considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In intracranial benign and malignant tumours, it is estimated that between 130 and 180 patients each year are candidates for proton beam therapy. Of these, between 50 and 75 patients have malignant glioma, 30-40 meningeoma, 20-25 arteriovenous malformations, 20-25 skull base tumours and 10-15 pituitary adenoma. In addition, 15 patients with ocular melanoma are candidates. [References: 93]

This last decade has seen a rapid proliferation in the development of the methodology which is certainly related in part to the simultaneous growth of high-resolution neuro-imaging techniques. By focusing the beams of 201 hemispherically arrayed cobalt 60 sources, the gamma-knife delivers a high dose of radiation to a small target. Another possibility proposed by several authors is the bragg peak cyclotron-generated irradiation with accelerated protons or helium ions. In Lille, since 1988, we have chosen to develop stereotactic radiosurgery, according to the system of Betti, by the association of Talairach's stereotactic methodology and external single-dose encephalic irradiation with high energy X-rays, delivered by means of a linear accelerator. The major indication for the use of this method is an arteriovenous malformation. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be proposed alone or in combination with surgery and embolisation. It has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment and an attractive alternative in carefully selected patients with intracranial tumours: slow-growing, well limited, deep-seated tumours, such as some gliomas, acoustic neurinomas, skull base meningiomas, pituitary adenomas. This treatment is also used to deliver a focal boost of radiation to previously administered fractionated radiotherapy in patients with small gliomas and solitary brain metastases

Epidemiologic studies demonstrated the role of sun exposure as a risk for uveal melanoma. Conservative treatment techniques are indicated for localised tumors when feasible. External radiation therapy and radioactive eye plaque brachytherapy seem as effective as surgery in term of survival. High tumor doses can be safely administered with either helium or proton beams. A partial preservation of the vision is possible in most of patients. However, even for locally controlled patients, distant metastases can occur. Liver is the most frequent metastatic site, and also the first involved. Liver metastases are associated with a low response rate, to dacarbazine and nitrosourea. Recent studies using a new nitrosourea, fotemustine, administered locally through an intra-arterial catheter, show that it produces encouraging results with a good hepatic and hematologic tolerance.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At the Department of Radiotherapy and Radiobiology, University of Vienna, stereotactic radiotherapy is offered to patients with uveal melanoma considered unsuitable for (106)Ru brachytherapy or local resection. For the present feasibility study, 8 patients were carefully selected according to their ability to fixate a small light source with the diseased eye and whether they had a rather small head to meet the limited geometric space available. A polymethyl methacrylate tube was attached to a stereotactic mask system in craniocaudal orientation supporting a 45 degrees mirror, which was placed in front of the diseased eye. At the other end of the tube, the patient was given a small fixation light, and a small camera was positioned beneath, which was shielded for use during MRI. A computer interface calculated and visualized the spatial difference of the actual and a given reference pupil position, which was defined before CT scanning, during the MRI sequences, and during treatment delivery at the linear accelerator. RESULTS: The described system can be attached to a conventional stereotactic mask system with minor modifications. Because of the large distance between the eye and the fixation light, the optical fixation system was well tolerated by all patients, and a stable position of the eye was obtained. The camera system can be used during CT and MRI without interference. Absorption of the 6-MV photon beam by the mirror and the polymethyl methacrylate tube was negligible. The computer interface designed to determine the pupil position uses an image-processing algorithm that correlates a template of the reference image with the actual image of the eye. Provided sufficient illumination of the pupil, the correlation function showed a pronounced minimum at the reference position. The precision of the algorithm was tested by phantom measurements. For a given 1 mm or 2 mm displacement, the interface reported a mean shift of 0.96 +/- 0.18 mm or 2.07 +/- 0.11 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of a new optical fixation system for linear accelerator-based stereotaxis. The artifact-free application of the camera system during image acquisition and irradiation and the use of the computer interface, which automatically monitored eye movements with submillimeter precision, provided large improvements compared with existing techniques. Given well-defined interruption criteria and accelerated image processing, the described system has a high potential to perform automatically gated treatment beam delivery in the near future

The use of IORT as a single component of radiation exposure does not lead to significant radiation damages to normal tissues. When IORT is combined with remote irradiation (the latter using doses of 30-60 Gy), 30% of patients develop radiation-induced normal tissue lesions. In the context of enhancing the local effect and, if possible, decreasing the dose of remote irradiation, it is expedient to increase IORT doses, which is in turn fraught with higher incidence and severity of radiation lesions. In this connection, it seems urgent to have a look for the potentialities to expand the radiotherapeutical range. This follows several directions	
0	1577	Considerations of marrow cellularity in 3-dimensional dosimetric models of the trabecular skeleton	Adipocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Bone and Bones/re [Radiation Effects], Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/pa [Pathology], Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Cadaver, Femur Head/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Humerus/re [Radiation Effects], Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry, Reference Values, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Dose assessment to active bone marrow is a critical feature of radionuclide therapy treatment planning. Skeletal dosimetry models currently used to assign radionuclide S values for clinical marrow dose assessment are based on bone and marrow cavity chord-length distributions. Accordingly, these models cannot explicitly consider energy loss to inactive marrow (adipose tissue) during particle transport across the trabecular marrow space (TMS). One method to account for this energy loss is to uniformly scale the resulting TMS absorbed fractions by reference values of site-specific marrow cellularity. In doing so, however, the resulting absorbed fractions for self-irradiation of the trabecular active marrow (TAM) do not converge to unity at low electron source energies. This study attempts to address this issue by using nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy images of trabecular bone to define 3-dimensional (3D) dosimetric models in which explicit spatial distributions of adipose tissue are introduced. METHODS: Cadaveric sources of trabecular bone were taken from both the femoral heads and humeral epiphyses of a 51-y-old male subject. The bone sites were sectioned and subsequently imaged at a proton resonance frequency of 200 MHz (4.7 T) using a 3D spin-echo pulse sequence. After image segmentation, voxel clusters of adipocytes were inserted interior to the marrow cavities of the binary images, which were then coupled to the EGS4 radiation transport code for simulation of active marrow electron sources. RESULTS: Absorbed fractions for self-irradiation of the TAM were tabulated for both skeletal sites. Substantial variations in the absorbed fraction to active marrow are seen with changes in marrow cellularity, particularly in the energy range of 100-500 keV. These variations are seen to be more dramatic in the humeral epiphysis (larger marrow volume fraction) than in the femoral head. CONCLUSION: Results from electron transport in 3D models of the trabecular skeleton indicate that current methods to account for marrow cellularity in chord-based models are incomplete. At 10 keV, for example, the Eckerman and Stabin model underestimates the self-absorbed fraction to active marrow by 75%. At 1 MeV, the model of Bouchet et al. overestimates this same value by 40%. In the energy range of 20-200 keV, neither model accurately predicts energy loss to the active bone marrow. Thus, it is proposed that future extensions of skeletal dosimetry models use 3D transport techniques in which explicit delineation of active and inactive marrow is feasible

The German Group of Pediatric Radiation Oncology (APRO) has generated a concept for a prospective evaluation of radiation-associated late effects in childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a nationwide central database for the documentation of radiation parameters and side effects of all children treated within therapy protocols of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A study center has been implemented in Muenster, the documentation has started in July 2001 in few centers in a pilot phase. Since February 2004 the documentation is done countrywide. Detailed documentation forms have been designed for treatment parameters and for doses applied at organs at risk. Furthermore, a uniform toxicity documentation, according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria, was chosen. Patients were reported from the study centers of the GPOH to the study center. All information was collected and analyzed in the study center. RESULTS: Till July 31, 2005, 438 documentations of radiation and 579 toxicity documentations of side effects have been collected in the study center. 46 centers for radiotherapy in Germany and one center each in Austria and in Switzerland took part in the documentation. The quality of documentation regarding completeness and plausibility fulfilled the expected criteria in most cases. This feasibility analysis showed that important information about organ dose levels and side effects was documented in a large number of patients (Figures 1 and 2). CONCLUSION: This prospective evaluation of radiotherapy and radiogenic side effects in children and adolescents will allow correlating doses at organs at risk and the incidence of acute and late sequelae in Germany. Further documentations and a longer follow-up are necessary to obtain powerful results

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used	
1	2420	Current developments in proton therapy: a review. [Review] [85 refs]	Engineering, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiobiology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The use of high-energy protons in radiotherapy was first proposed in 1946. In the last decade there has been a significant growth in the number of centres using protons in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disease. To date (January 1993) a total of more than 11,500 patients have been treated world-wide. Encouraging clinical results have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this article is to outline the advantages of proton beams and to review current developments in physics and engineering applied to the field of proton therapy with particular emphasis on proton accelerator technology and the development of proton therapy facilities. The production of clinically useful beams is discussed and the relative merits of different treatment systems compared. Reference is also made to the factors affecting the absorbed dose in a patient and to proton radiobiology together with the results of studies of comparisons of treatment planning with protons with that using conventional photon therapy. The dosimetry of proton beams is also reviewed. [References: 85]

A uniform beam is produced by a double foil scattering system. The initial Bragg peak is spread across the target volume by the use of beam modulators. These are rotating four-vaned stepped absorbers made from Perspex. Two beam lines can be configured with different positions of modulators and range limiters. The first has a maximum penetration of 31.9 +/- 0.2 mm in water and the second a penetration of 31.2 +/- 0.2 mm. The second configuration has the advantage of less variation in beam penumbra, with a typical value of 1.7 +/- 0.1 mm for the 90% to 10% decrement lines. The patients are treated with individually shaped collimators. Beam output varies by less than 2% over the range of collimator areas used. The resulting whole-body dose equivalent to patient has also been assessed. In the first three years of operation over 250 patients have been treated

The tumors of all patients were histologically confirmed. A 45 MV betatron was used for radiation of the clipped tumor volume plus a 1 to 2 cm margin. Fourteen patients were treated by a three-field technic with the use of opposed lateral photon beams and an anterior mixed photon-electron beam. Five patients were treated with either a four-field "box" or a three-field photon technic. Tumor doses of 5,900 to 6,700 r were delivered over seven to nine weeks. The twelve month survival rate after diagnosis is 53%. This compares favorably with published reports of patients treated surgically for cure. Four patients are alive 18.5 to 64 months after diagnosis. Three are clinically free of disease. Treatment has been well tolerated and there have been no significant radiation complications

After a mean follow-up period of 15.6 months 3 eyes had to be enucleated. In two eyes fresh tumors developed, which were successfully treated with local beta-radiation. In the remaining 22 eyes the tumor growth was stopped or the tumor regressed. External beam therapy for choroidal melanomas seems to be an effective alternative to enucleation in eyes with tumors not accessible for other methods of treatment and which cannot be enucleated, e.g., single eyes

In seven normal subjects at 1.5 T the nOe values were 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0 +/- 0.3, and 0.3 +/- 0.2 for myocardial PCr, gamma-ATP, alpha-ATP, and beta-ATP, respectively, not significantly different from those in chest muscle. Distortion of the measured PCr/ATP ratios due to differences in the nOe may require accurate correction to realize the full benefit of the effect in studies involving quantitative intergroup comparisons

The measurement of acoustic properties of melanomas in vivo has not yet been reported after proton-beam irradiation. This prospective study was conducted on a cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with primary malignant melanoma to assess in vivo the ability of quantitative echography to detect changes in choroidal malignant melanomas after proton-beam irradiation and to follow the ultrasonographic changes during 24 months posttreatment. Echographic evaluations of these patients were performed at diagnosis and repeated every 6 months after treatment over a 2-y period. The acoustic parameters included in this work are derived from the calibrated tissue backscatter spectra (spectral slope, spectral intercept and apparent integrated backscatter) of a selected tumor volume after correction of the apparatus transfer function and beam diffraction. Clinical parameters resulting from conventional echography were also quantified and included mainly tumor height, tumor vascularity and internal reflectivity. Spectral intercept and apparent integrated backscatter were found to be the most useful to evaluate changes in melanomas after treatment. Significant (p < 0.05) differences of these parameter values were observed between pre- and postproton therapy. In particular, significant changes (compared with baseline) were observed for these parameters, even when the tumor size after treatment was not significantly different from baseline. The results suggest that quantitative spectrum analysis of frequency-dependent backscatter can provide information about the structural modifications of choroidal malignant melanomas as a result of proton-beam irradiation

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

Both treatments induce growth arrest within the tumour and its slow involution over several years. Although ocular retention rates are excellent, regrowth of tumours due to resistance and neovascular glaucoma leads to enucleation of up to 10% of affected eyes. Proton irradiation involves part of the iris in most cases and we noticed that neovascularisation only occurred in the part of the iris that was not irradiated. We therefore conducted this study to determine the relationship between the development of iris neovascularisation and iris irradiation. METHODS: A total of 21 enucleation specimens from patients who had previously had proton irradiation were collected from the files of the Department of Pathology, Moorfields Eye Hospital during the 5-year period from 1994 to 1999. Sections of these eyes were assessed for VEGF-A, bFGF, and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) by immunohistochemistry. Ophthalmic notes and radiotherapy records were reviewed to assess the extent of iris irradiation. RESULTS: In all, 11 cases showed clinical evidence of iris neovascularisation and were selected for further study. Three of these eyes also showed clinical evidence of regrowth of the tumour. Histological evidence of iris neovascularization was noted in all 11 of the eyes examined, and was only present in the nonirradiated side of the iris in 8/11 eyes. NVI was present on both sides of the iris in three cases, but was less severe in the irradiated part. Expression of VEGF-A was at most weak within the tumour, but was present in the detached retina and in the epithelium of both ciliary body and iris. Some bFGF staining was noted around vessels in the iris stroma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that irradiation leads to iris atrophy, and that atrophic, irradiated iris is resistant to the development of neovascularisation

A total of 184 patients were treated. The authors have been of opinion that therapeutic methods depended on function of the neuroendocrine system and adrenal cortex, e. g. reserpine used after gamma-therapy alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy increased the efficacy of therapy and reduced the time of remission. Parlodel used alone or in combination with chloditan could be used in therapy of early forms of the disease in young patients. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy and proton beam therapy of the hypophysis were recommended in hypophysial adenomas. Proton beam therapy of the hypophysis was an effective method for therapy of patients with diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and could be used in diffuse nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy

In 1975, approximately 14% of all new cancers were gynecologic, representing almost 68,000 new cases. Although end results in treatment of early cervix and corpus uteri lesions are quite good, results in treatment of early cervix and corpus uteri lesions are quite good, results in treatment of the later stage lesions, as well as ovarian and vulvo-vaginal tumors, are discouraging. Progress in the future will center around five primary areas: 1) greater understanding and utilization of radiation sensitizing agents such as hyperbaric oxygen, metronidazol, and other electroaffinic agents, purine and pyrimadine analogs, and antibiotics such as Actinomycin D and Adriamycin; 2) introduction into clinical use of high LET particle beams, such as fast neutrons, pi mesons, low atomic number nuclei, and heavy accelerated nuclei; 3) combined modality therapy utilizing radiation and chemotherapy or radiation and immunotherapy for management of subclinical disease; 4) radiobiologic and clinical advances in the utilization of radiation and hyperthermia; and 5) improved understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the gynecologic malignancies with increasing use of staging laparotomies, lymphangiography and peritoneoscopy

This has made intensity-modulated electron and photon beams as powerful as today's uniform dose proton therapy. To be able to cure also the most advanced hypoxic and radiation-resistant tumors of complex local spread, intensity-modulated light ion beams are really the ultimate tool and in clinical practice 2 to 3 times less expensive per patient treated than proton therapy. This development and the recent development of advanced tumor diagnostics based on PET-CT imaging of the tumor cell density open the field for new powerful radiobiologically based treatment optimization methods. The ultimate step is to use the unique radiobiologic and dose distributional advantages of light ion beams for truly optimized bioeffect planning where the integral three-dimensional dose delivery and tumor cell survival can be monitored by PET-CT imaging and corrected by biologically based adaptive therapy optimization methods. PURPOSE: The main purpose of the present paper is to discuss the principal areas of development of therapy optimization, by considering the therapy chain from tumor diagnostics and the use of three-dimensional predictive assay to biologically based treatment optimization with special focus on the rapid clinical development of advanced light ion therapy. METHODS: Besides the "classical" approaches using low ionization density hydrogen ions (protons, but also possibly deuterons and tritium nuclei) and high ionization density carbon ions, two new approaches will be discussed. In the first one, lithium or beryllium or boron ions, which induce the least detrimental biologic effect to normal tissues for a given biologic effect in a small volume of the tumor, will be key particles. In the second approach, referred patients will be given a high-dose, high-precision "boost" treatment with carbon or oxygen ions during 1 week preceding the final treatment with conventional radiation in the referring hospital. The rationale behind these approaches is to minimize the high ionization density dose to the normal-tissue stroma outside but sometimes also inside the tumor bed and to ensure a more uniform and optimal biologic effectiveness in the tumor, also on the microscopic scale. The present discussion indicates that BIologically Optimized predictive Assay based light ion Radiation Therapy (Bio-Art) is really the ultimate way to perform high-precision radiation therapy using checkpoints of the integral dose delivery and the tumor response and, based on this information, perform compensating corrections of the dose delivery. By using biologically optimized scanned high-energy photon or ion beams, it is possible to measure in vivo the three-dimensional dose delivery using the same PET-CT camera that was used for diagnosing the tumor spread. This method thus opens up the door for truly three-dimensional biologically optimized adaptive radiation therapy, where the measured dose delivery to the true target tissues can be used to fine-adjust the incoming beams, so that possible errors in the integral therapy process are eliminated toward the end of the treatment. Interestingly enough, practically all major error sources--such as organ motion, treatment planning errors, patient setup errors, and dose delivery problems due to gantry, multileaf, or scanning beam errors--can be corrected for in this way. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Radiobiologically optimized dose delivery using intensity and radiation quality modulation based on high-resolution PET-CT or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI)-based tumor and normal-tissue imaging is probably the ultimate development of radiation therapy, taking the unique physical and biologic advantages of light ions fully into account in truly patient-individualized curative treatment schedules. Using recently available biologically based treatment ilable biologically based treatment optimization algorithms, it is possible to improve the treatment outcome for advanced tumors by as much as 10-40%. The adaptive radiotherapy process based both on three-dimensional tumor cell survival and dose delivery monitoring has the potential of percent accuracy in tumor response and dose delivery monitoring, using two-dimensional, narrow high-energy photon beam scanning and three-dimensional (11)C Bragg peak scanning for radiation quality and intensity-modulated dose delivery. There is no doubt that the future of radiation therapy is very promising, and gradually more and more patients may not even need advanced surgery. Instead, they could be cured by biologically optimized electron, photon, or light ion therapy, where the densely ionizing Bragg peak is placed solely in the gross tumor, and a lower ionization density is used in microscopically invasive tumor volumes.

The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. METHODS: Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. RESULTS: The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research

Analyses of the data for TB cohorts who were exposed to multiple fluoroscopies show an apparently similar breast cancer risk compared with those for the acutely exposed A-bomb survivors. However, the fluoroscopy cohorts were subjected to very much lower-energy photons (60-80 kVp) compared with the A-bomb survivors; the increased RBE associated with the low photon energies to which these fluoroscopy cohorts were exposed suggests that, in comparison to the risk estimates for the A-bomb survivors, the risk estimates from the X-ray fluoroscopy cohorts are increased because of the lower-energy X rays and decreased by a similar amount due to fractionation, resulting in an overall apparent equality of risk. Thus the results from the most powerful epidemiological data sets available for assessing breast cancer risks after fractionated exposure to low-LET radiation (the fluoroscopy cohorts) are quite consistent with a lower radiation risk for a fractionated exposure in comparison to an acute exposure. In general, for any cancer site, estimates of the dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) generated by comparing the results for A-bomb survivors with those for the TB fluoroscopy cohorts should probably be roughly doubled from their apparent values because of the increased RBE of the fluoroscopy X rays

[Review] [27 refs]	Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Pelvic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Sacrococcygeal Region, Survival Rate	Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms representing less than 3% of all primary bone tumors. They usually have a benign histological appearance and a slow growth rate. Their locoregional progression nearly always causes suffering and eventually death. Efforts to increase local control have included aggressive surgery, radiation therapy or combined approaches but locally free survival rates remain relatively low and have not exceeded 30% at 5 years. Sacrococcygeal chordomas, which represent approximately 50% of the localizations, have been investigated less frequently than those at the base of the skull or cervical region with primary or post-operative radiation therapy. The disappointing results with photon therapy in a multimodality approach and the good results reported by Schoenthaler with charged particles in the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory led us to propose fast neutron therapy in the management of inoperable or recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. Preliminary results obtained from only 12 patients indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy seems to be a good alternative for radical treatment of chordomas in the case of microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor.

[Review] [61 refs] [French]	Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, France, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neutrons, Photons, Probability, Radiation, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Salivary Gland Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival	If low LET radiation therapy (photons, electrons), following radical microscopically and complete surgery can improve results in term of local control from 34 to 74% for salivary gland tumors, local control is more difficult to achieve in advanced tumors and only palliative treatment is usually attempted. In this survey, all the patient series treated worldwide were reviewed. They show an overall control rate of 31% with photon vs 64% with neutron therapy. A prospective randomised trial sponsored by the RTOG and the MRC published in 1988 and reviewed in 1993 showed an overall locoregional complete tumor clearance of 67% for neutrons and 17% for photons (P < 0.005), with 68% and 25% survival at two years for neutrons and photons respectively. This study was closed for ethical reasons. In Orleans, since 1987, 59 patients have been treated. At five years the persistent local control probability was 69.5%, the five-year crude survival probability 66% and the five-year tumor free survival probability was 64.5%. This review provides evidence that surgical treatment for salivary gland tumors should be limited to patients presenting a high likelihood of negative surgical margin and a small risk of facial nerve damage. Others patients should receive neutron radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment. [References: 61]	
1	1714	Biological factors influencing the RBE of neutrons: implications for their past, present and future use in radiotherapy.

It is clear from current radiobiological knowledge that some of the postulates that formed the mechanistic basis for past clinical trials were incorrect. Such discrepancies, along with the inherent physical disadvantages of neutron beams in terms of collimation and intensity modulation, may partially account for the lack of therapeutic benefit observed in many randomized clinical trials. Moreover, it is equally apparent that indiscriminate prescription of fast-neutron therapy is likely to lead to an adverse clinical outcome in a proportion of patients. Hence any renewed efforts to establish a niche for this modality in clinical radiation oncology will necessitate the development of a triage system that can discriminate those patients who might benefit from fast-neutron therapy from those who might be harmed by it. In the future, fast-neutron therapy might be prescribed based upon the relative status of appropriate molecular parameters that have a differential impact upon radiosensitivity to photons compared to fast neutrons.

Small tumors located such that normal tissues do not seriously limit total dose and those with "favorable" histology are more radiocurable than large tumors located over a critical normal tissue. However, the precision of prognosis based upon those features is relatively low. The need for other parameters for more accurate predictability is greater than ever because of the existence of different radiation modalities, including neutrons, and the development of a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs that can be used alone or in combination with radiation and surgery. In this laboratory we are testing the micronucleus (MN) assay for measuring the relative biological effectiveness of high- and low-LET irradiations in mouse tumors and a new primary human tumor cell culture system for making direct measurements of tumor cell radiosensitivity. The potential usefulness of these two systems in predicting human tumor response to radiotherapy is discussed

Preoperative use of radiotherapy influences but insignificantly the postoperative course. As a whole, the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality does not differ considerably from that in patients not irradiated with a Betatron. The state of blood coagulation was studied before and prior to surgery in 34 patients previously irradiated with a Betatron. Following the irradiation some changes indicative of hypocoagulation were revealed. In the early postoperative period (2d--10th day postoperatively) a marked increase in the fibrinogen "A" content is observed

Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

Tumors were irradiated with 2,500 rad at each of four to five sessions, with an interval of one to two days between sessions. The melanomas ranged in diameter from 8 to 20 mm and were from 3.0 to 13.7 mm in thickness. Patients were followed up for three months to seven years. In 11 cases, the tumor was fully resorbed. Complications included radiation cataract, postradiation glaucoma, radiation retinopathy, and exudative retinal detachment. In 12 cases, enucleation was performed because tumor growth persisted. Four patients died during follow-up period because of metastasis. The eye was preserved in 47 cases

Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation

Twenty-eight patients with cilio-choroidal melanoma were involved in the study, 7 male and 21 female ones, aged 48.4 on an average. The authors' findings evidence that postradiation changes in the anterior segment of the eye, resulting from radiation iridocyclitis, are mainly responsible for the development of secondary glaucoma. Preliminary laser-effected formation of iridal coloboma is conducive to a normal flow in the anterior chamber at the expense of an additional pupil functioning and thus helps reduce the possibility of secondary glaucoma development by 1.6 times (or by 38.5%)

The results of a study are presented showing how detailed diagnostic information available from MRI is helpful in defining the target volume to be irradiated and the critical normal structures. By using 3-dimensional planning techniques, an assessment was made of the relative merits of proton beam therapy and of X ray treatment for patients with early stage and locally advanced carcinoma of the nasopharynx. For both types of patient, the study suggests that the use of protons for the major part of treatment results in a more even distribution of dose to the tumor and an increase of approximately 5 Gy in median tumor dose with substantial reductions in doses to adjacent normal tissues. The superior dose distributions possible with protons should translate into improved local control and reduced morbidity. The difficulties of proton treatment planning for this site are addressed

The NOE enhancements of inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphocreatine (PCr), gamma-, alpha-, and beta-nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) from 19 measurements were 0.51 +/- 0.10, 0.64 +/- 0.03, 0.53 +/- 0.03, 0.56 +/- 0.08, and 0.47 +/- 0.05, respectively. The relaxation times were independent of proton irradiation and from 23 measurements were 3.49 +/- 0.35, 4.97 +/- 0.58, 4.07 +/- 0.36, 2.90 +/- 0.25, and 3.61 +/- 0.25 s for Pi, PCr, gamma-, alpha-, and beta-NTP, respectively. No significant differences between gender and age were observed for either NOE enhancements or relaxation times. Also, among nine volunteers, we observed no significant differences in T1 between the coupled and decoupled cases

This article summarizes the current status of preclinical and clinical research on 223RaCl2. Potential advantages of 223Ra to that of external beam irradiation and registered beta-emitting bone seekers are discussed. Published data of 223Ra dosimetry in mice and a therapeutic study in a skeletal metastases model in nude rats have indicated significant therapeutic potential of bone-seeking alpha-emitters. This article provides short-term and long-term results from the first clinical single dosage trial. We also present data from a repeated dosage study of five consecutive injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight, once every 3rd week, or two injections of 125 kBq/kg body weight, 6 weeks apart. Furthermore, interim results are described for a randomized phase 2 trial involving 64 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and painful skeletal metastases who received four monthly injections of 223Ra or saline as an adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy. Lastly, we present preliminary dose estimates for 223Ra in humans. Results indicate that repeated dosing is feasible and toxicity is low, and that opportunities are available for combined treatment strategies. [References: 57]

Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 65 women (age 25-70 years, mean 47 years) with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB were initially treated with external beam radiotherapy on a telecobalt or 6 MV linear accelerator to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 5-6 weeks. After 2-3 weeks of completing external radiation, patients received interstitial brachytherapy with Iridium-192 (activity 0.5-1 mCi/cm) using a Syed-Neblett perineal template. The median dose delivered to the implant volume was 24 Gy (range 20-32 Gy) delivered at an average dose rate of 0.70 Gy/h (range 0.40-1.20 Gy/h). A point defined at 1.5 cm lateral to the central uterine tandem at the level of os was taken as a representative for assessing the dose to the cervix. Mean doses delivered by interstitial brachytherapy to point A, cervix, point B and rectum were 38 Gy, 34 Gy, 16 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 53 months, the actuarial disease free survival and overall survival for 65 patients at both 5 and 10 years was 64% and 44%, respectively. Response to radiotherapy was a strong predictor of local control with 82% of patients continuing to have pelvic control after initial complete response. Overall, nine (14%) patients had persistent disease, ten (15%) developed a central recurrence after initial control and three patients developed distant metastasis on follow-up. No patient had any immediate treatment-related complication. Late toxicity included grade I-II rectal reactions in five patients and grade IV bladder complication (vesico-vaginal fistula) in two patients. 5 years after treatment, one patient developed intestinal obstruction, which was relieved after conservative management. Two patients developed vaginal stenosis. The 5- and 10-year disease free survival was 48% in patients aged less than 45 years as compared to 80% in patients of more than 45 years (p = 0.009). Dose to the cervical point was a prognostic indicator with 5- and 10-year disease free survival of 47% in patients who received < 35 Gy in comparison to 80% in patients who had > 35 Gy (p = 0.03). There was no difference in local control and survival in patients with minimal and moderate parametrial involvement. Bulky disease (> 4 cm) at presentation and a longer gap between external radiation and brachytherapy showed a trend towards inferior local control. CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial brachytherapy after external beam irradiation in patients with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB results in acceptable local control, survival and complication rates. Increased dose to the cervical disease results in improved local control and survival and should therefore be considered while optimizing brachytherapy treatment plans. Comparison of the results with those of standard intracavitary therapy remains to be proven in a randomized trial

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients	
0	335	In vivo EBT radiochromic film dosimetry of electron beam for Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET)	Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Film Dosimetry, Humans, Italy, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skin Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	EBT radiochromic films were used to determine skin-dose maps for patients undergone Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET). Gafchromic EBT radiochromic film is one of the newest radiation-induced auto-developing photon and electron-beam analysis films available for therapeutic radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy applications. EBT films can be particularly useful in TSET; due to patient morphology, underdosed regions typically occur, and the radiochromic film represents a suitable candidate for monitoring them. In this study, TSET was applied to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The technique for TSET was implemented by using an electron beam with a nominal energy of 6MeV. The patient was treated in a standing position using dual angled fields in order to obtain the greatest dose uniformity along the patient's longitudinal axis. The electron beam energy was degraded by a PMMA filter. The in vivo dose distribution was determined through the use of EBT films, as well as of thermoluminescent dosimeters for comparison (TLDs). EBT results showed a reasonable agreement with TLDs data

0	1766	A tool to measure radiotherapy complexity and workload: derivation from the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) concept.[see comment]	Efficiency,Organizational, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Time, Time Management, Workload	Radiotherapy workload is poorly represented by simple parameters of patients, fractions or fields treated because these do not contain any measure of treatment complexity. However, complexity is increasing and there is an urgent need to quantify this. We have evaluated the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) model as a measure of radiotherapy workload and complexity. Radiotherapy treatment times, from the patient entering to exiting the treatment room maze, were measured for 1298 treatment sessions on 269 patients. The data were used to assess the original model and derive three new models for predicting treatment duration. The most complicated, the 'Addenbrooke's complex model', contained two additional predictor variables, including 'site/technique', in a linear additive form. Before the study, the department used a standard treatment appointment time of 10 minutes. However, 50% of the measured treatments took longer than 10 minutes, (mean 10.9). Summed over the working day, this discrepancy indicates that a standard 10-minute appointment is a poor basis for scheduling radiotherapy. The original BTE model was effective in predicting treatment times, although this was improved by refinement of the model. The Addenbrooke's complex model correctly predicted 70% of treatment times to within 2 minutes (55% for the original BTE model), 80% to within 2.5 minutes and 95% to within 4.7 minutes. The percentage of the variation in observed times accounted for by the model is 59.4%. The models can represent radiotherapy complexity, can improve scheduling on linear accelerators, and are likely to be applicable to other departments. They are thus tools to assess the impact of changes in complexity from new techniques, trial protocols (e.g. the Medical Research Council prostate radiotherapy trial RTO1), and possible time saving from advanced technology such as multileaf collimators (MLCs) or automated machine set-up. The replacement of manually-lifted shielding blocks by MLCs should save 1.1-1.5 minutes for a three- or four-field pelvic plan (i.e. 12%-13%). The models could also be used to aid planning for future linear accelerator provision and for costing radiotherapy treatment

A study was undertaken to determine the frequency and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT in patients who had undergone conformal proton (to a limited volume) radiation therapy. We compared these findings with those from a group of patients who had undergone a combination of photon and conformal proton (to a larger volume) radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Proton radiation therapy was associated with a lower frequency of pulmonary injury than the combined regimen. Injury correlated well with the volume of normal lung that was irradiated. Conformal proton radiation therapy appears to be able to reduce the incidence and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

The aim was to provide maximal local tumor control while minimizing complications such as cranial nerve injuries. METHODS: Thirty-one acoustic neuromas in 30 patients were treated with proton beam therapy from March 1991 to June 1999. The mean tumor volume was 4.3 cm(3). All patients underwent pretreatment neurological evaluation, contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and audiometric evaluation. Standard fractionated proton radiotherapy was used at daily doses of 1.8 to 2.0 cobalt Gray equivalent: patients with useful hearing before treatment (Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II) received 54.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 fractions; patients without useful hearing received 60.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 to 33 fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 30 patients were assessable for tumor control and cranial nerve injury. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 98 months (mean, 34 mo), during which no patients demonstrated disease progression on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Eleven patients demonstrated radiographic regression. Of the 13 patients with pretreatment Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II hearing, 4 (31%) maintained useful hearing. No transient or permanent treatment-related trigeminal or facial nerve dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSION: Fractionated proton beam therapy provided excellent local control of acoustic neuromas when treatment was administered in moderate doses. No injuries to the Vth or VIIth cranial nerves were observed. A reduction in the tumor dose is being evaluated to increase the hearing preservation rate

Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated

DESIGN: A prospective phase 2 clinical trial. SETTING: Loma Linda University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74%, and 72%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87% vs 49%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment	
1	374	A technique of partial breast irradiation utilizing proton beam radiotherapy: comparison with conformal x-ray therapy.[see comment]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Heart, Humans, Immobilization, Immobilization/is [Instrumentation], Prone Position, Protons, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, Vacuum, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To develop a breast immobilization system and clinical technique to deliver partial breast irradiation with a proton beam and compare dose distributions using proton therapy and conformal x-rays. METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival

The studies have demonstrated that a diet consisting of only dehydrated food products can be used for a prolonged time (up to 1 year). Dehydrated foods after a 2-year storage and proton irradiation at a dose of 24,000 rad retain their biological value and assure an adequate nutritional status. On this basis a space diet composed of dehydrated foods has been developed

The test subjects were kept on the diet consisting of dehydrated foods: fresh, stored for up to 2 years, and exposed to proton irradiation at a dose of 24,000 rad. Metabolism of amino acids was investigated under these conditions. It was concluded that during prolonged storage and irradiation proteins of dehydrated foods retained their biological value. This allows their use in long-term space flights

The cavity is defined to confine irradiation to the hand and modifies the neutron spectrum produced by a low energy accelerator neutron source to optimize activation per dose. Neutron and gamma-ray dose rates were measured with the microdosimetric technique using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter at the hand irradiation site and inside the hand access hole. For the outside of the cavity, a spherical neutron dose equivalent meter and a Farmer dosemeter were employed instead due to the low intensity of the radiation field. The maximum dose equivalent rate at the outside of the cavity was 2.94 microSv/100 microA min, which is lower by a factor of 1/2260 than the dose rate at the hand irradiation position. The local dose contributions from a hand, an arm and the rest of a body to the effective dose rate were estimated to be 1.73, 0.782 and 2.94 microSv/100 microA min, respectively. For the standard irradiation protocol of the in vivo hand activation, 300 microA min, an effective dose of 16.3 microSv would be delivered

This study was to evaluate the influence of radiotherapy on the survival of stage IV NSCLC patients. METHODS: Clinical data of 287 patients with stage IV NSCLC were retrospectively analyzed. Whole brain was treated with two parallel fields irradiation; bone metastases were treated with one local field irradiation. Primary tumors, regional lymph nodes and other distant metastases were treated by conventional fractionation radiotherapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Whole brain and bone radiotherapy was delivered with a total dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks. The median dose for primary tumors and regional lymph nodes was 50 Gy (20-70 Gy), and the median dose for other distant metastases was 46 Gy (40-60 Gy). RESULTS: The median survival time of the 287 patients was 9 months (8-10 months). The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 30.2% and 8.9%. The median survival time was significantly longer in the patients received chemotherapy than in the patients didn't (10 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.049). In the patients with brain, bone, or other distant metastases, the median survival time was 8, 9, and 10 months, respectively; the 1-year survival rates were 24.8%, 28.7%, and 37.5%, respectively; the 2-year survival rates were 6.7%, 7%, and 15.3%, respectively. By unitivariate analysis, histological type and patients' age were prognostic factors of NSCLC. The median survival time was significantly longer in adenocarcinoma patients than in squamous cell carcinoma patients and other carcinoma patients (10 months vs. 7 and 9 months, P = 0.046), longer in the patients of < or =60 years old than in those of >60 years old (11 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.012), and longer in the patients with only bone metastases than in the patients with concomitant other distant metastases (10 months vs. 6 months, P = 0.033), but there was no significant difference between the patients with only brain metastases and those with concomitant other distant metastases (9 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.374). Radiotherapy for primary tumors and lymph nodes, complications of other chronic diseases, and irradiation dose and pattern had no effect on the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Histological type and patients' age may affect the efficacy of radiotherapy on stage IV NSCLC. The irradiation patterns of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks have no effect on the survival of patients with brain or bone metastases

Among these 86 cases were admitted primarily with view of treatment. Within the period conception of therapy was changed drastically. Where as in former time treatment consists in excision of the tumour with following conventional X-ray therapy, since 1973 therapy of choice was radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphonodectomy. Based on these facts a retrospective comparison of the survival rates in possible, particularly distribution of stages is likely the same in the two groups. The group treated since 1973 has essential better survival rates. This can be attributed to the conception of radical operative treatment preferred in literature predominantly. Mortality rate is below 5 per cent which will be favourable in the geriatric clientele. To make the results of treatment comparable internationally a postoperative classification should be proposed like in breast cancer. The question of the position of an additional postoperative irradiation is to be answered only with aid of a prospective multicenter study

This study was to analyze long-term treatment efficacy, and relevant factors influencing prognosis of NPC in children. METHODS: From Jan. 1975 to Dec. 1995, 47 children,7-14 years old, with NPC diagnosed by pathology received radiotherapy in our hospital. Radiation doses were 52-74 Gy/6-13 weeks [(64.68+/-5.68) Gy] in nasopharynx, and 46-73 Gy/5-13 weeks [(57.77+/-5.86) Gy] in neck; 21 received 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluoroucil, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) before radiotherapy. Survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and analyzed by log-rank test with SPSS 10.0 software. RESULTS: The 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 47 patients were 72.3%, 53.2%, and 40.4%, respectively. Clinical stage (P=0.046), mode of biopsy (P=0.024), radiation dose in nasopharynx (P=0.049), and short-term efficacy (P=0.005) correlated with prognosis of these patients. The average height of 15 male children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years was (161.5+/-1.23) cm. Among 3 female children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years, 2 had menstruation disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage, mode of biopsy, radiation dose in nasopharynx, short-term efficacy may influence prognosis of NPC in children. Radiation-induced long-term sequelae of NPC in children should not be overlooked

Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent complication, which resolved in all except 4 patients. Survival at 8 years was 52%, with 14% relapse-free survival. Patients with nodular histology had a more favorable prognosis than those with diffuse histology (median relapse-free survival of 24 vs. 12 months). There were 2 cases of erythroleukemia, which occurred after combination chemotherapy was given for relapse. Though TBI can offer complete remission and extended survival in advanced NHL, most patients eventually relapse and it should not be considered as a curative mode of therapy

Local control and good function can be achieved in the great majority of patients treated with radiation therapy, with particularly good results (95% local control) obtained for lesions of the distal extremity i.e., below the elbow or knee. The most common site of failure is distant metastasis, and the outstanding prognostic indicator is histologic grade. Disease-free survival correlates strongly with grade, with 85%, 51%, and 17% 2-yr disease-free survival for grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Lymph node metastasis is an uncommon first site of failure, and prophylactic nodal irradiation or lymphadenectomy is not recommended. The value of chemotherapy or immunotherapy is not firmly established as far as enhancing local control. It is hoped that distant metastasis can be prevented by the use of such adjuvant therapy. Locally advanced, nonresectable sarcoma may be better treated with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, and promising results have been reported with fast neutron treatment

CT consisted of two cycles of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2, by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days and cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on day 4 with mannitol-induced diuresis at 4-week intervals. Postoperatively, RT was administered when resection margins were minimal or if paraesophageal nodes were abnormal; the RT consisted of 5,000 to 5,400 cGy to the tumor area plus a 800- to 1,200-cGy boost to known abnormal tumor margins. Nineteen of 24 patients were resectable (79%). There was one SR death (5%). One of 22 had a normal barium swallow post-CT, no visible tumor at SR, and no pathologic evidence of any residual disease. There was complete radiologic and gross clinical disappearance of tumor post-CT or post-SR in ten of 22 patients (45%). Four of 22 (18%) had greater than or equal to 50% regression, and five of 22 (23%) had no response. Toxicity of CT was mild. Eight of 19 patients (42%) received RT, and six of 19 (32%) received CT postoperatively. Sixteen of 24 (67%) are alive with a median duration of observation of 9.5 months. Eight of 24 (33%) are dead, five of whom had not responded to preoperative CT. Ten of 14 responders are alive and disease free. The mean survival time for nonresponders was 6.70 months and for responders, 20.40 months, with the longest survivor disease free at 45 months

To assess the benefits of aggressive treatment of chordomas, the authors compared results in patients treated aggressively at the first presentation of this disease with results in patients who were similarly treated, but after recurrence. METHODS: Among 36 patients with cervical chordomas who were treated at the authors' institution, 22 underwent primary aggressive treatment (Group A) and 14 were treated secondarily after tumor recurrence (Group B). Two cases were excluded from Group A because of unrelated early deaths and three from Group B because of insufficient pre- or postoperative data. Most tumors were located at the suboccipital level and only eight cases at a level below C-2. Radiotherapy and proton therapy were similarly conducted in both groups of patients. The actuarial survival rates were 80 and 65% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, in Group A patients and 50 and 0% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, in Group B patients (p = 0.049, log-rank test). The actuarial recurrence-free rates were 70 and 35% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, in Group A and 0% at 3 years in Group B (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The numbers of recurrences per year were 0.15 in Group A and 0.62 in Group B (p > 0.05). All other parameters that were analyzed (patient age, delay before diagnosis, clinical symptoms, chondroid type of lesion, and histological features) did not prove to influence prognosis in a statistically significant manner. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive therapy, combining as radical a resection as possible with radiotherapy, seems to improve the prognoses of suboccipital and cervical chordomas when applied at the patient's first presentation with the disease

METHODS: A contemporary series of patients managed with wide surgical excision, radiation therapy (three-dimensional conformal radiation, interstitial radiation, and charged-particle or proton therapy), and cryo-therapy were reviewed. RESULTS: We used preoperative cancer grade, transrectal ultrasound, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in all patients, and cross-sectional imaging and bone scans in selected patients to allow for reasonably accurate cancer staging and selection of patients most likely to be cured by radical prostatectomy or radiation. In patients with extracapsular extension of prostate cancer, wide surgical excision and achievement of a clear surgical margin had therapeutic value. Newer radiation techniques resulted in a higher likelihood of prostate cancer control than previous techniques. Cryotherapy for patients with stages T1 through 3 prostate cancer was associated with a posttreatment undetectable PSA rate of 48% and a positive biopsy rate of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with organ-confined and, therefore, curable prostate cancer can be identified. Well-performed radical prostatectomy, radiation, and cryotherapy are alternative treatments for the management of localized prostate cancer. [References: 64]

METHODS: Five control subjects, 14 patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 10 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent single-volume HMRS with an echo time of 20 ms. Twenty-five patients had received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy previously. Using the curve-fitting program supplied by the manufacturer, peak areas for n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and MI were normalized with respect to the peak area of creatine (Cr). Ratios for MI/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr were obtained for each lesion and retrospectively compared with the histologic grade of the lesion. RESULTS: Levels of MI/Cr were higher (0.82 +/- 0.25) in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, intermediate (0.49 +/- 0.07) in control subjects, and lower in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (0.33 +/- 0.16) and GBM (0.15 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a trend toward lower MI levels in the presence of anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs compared with those of low-grade astrocytomas. MI levels may have implications in the grading of cerebral astrocytomas

Over 150 patients have been irradiated with heavy charged particle beams including helium, carbon, neon, and argon ions. Pilot studies have included such tumor sites as glioma of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the pancreas, carcinoma of the stomach, ocular melanoma, and carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Prospective studies are planned to investigate the improved dose localization potential (helium) and the enhanced biologic and physical dose potential (carbon, neon) in a controlled trial against the best available megavoltage irradiation techniques

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles

Despite surgical exploration and an extensive diagnostic workup including radiological, nuclear medicine, and computer-assisted tomographic studies, many patients proved to have occult liver metastases manifested within 9 months post treatment. In addition, local and regional control of the primary neoplasm (approximately 20%) has been difficult to obtain even with doses of 6000 equivalent rad in 7 1/2 weeks. Gastric and biliary obstruction have required surgical bypass procedures since irradiation has not been successful in relieving obstructive symptoms. Evidence of gastrointestinal injury has been present in postradiation therapy in approximately 10% of patients, a figure which might be higher if more patients had a longer survival (average 10 months). Some patients require pancreatic enzyme supplementation because of pancreatic deficiency either secondary to tumor or treatment. Further improvement in local control and survival requires better diagnostic methods for evaluation of local and metastatic spread, improved therapy for local and regional disease, as well as therapy directed at occult liver metastases that are frequently present

Heavy charged particle radiotherapy offers the potential advantages of improved dose localization and/or enhanced biologic effect, depending on particle selected for treatment. Target sites have included selected head and neck tumors, ocular melanomata, malignant gliomata of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the stomach, carcinoma of the pancreas, selected juxtaspinal tumors and other locally advanced, unresectable tumors. A Phase III prospective clinical trial has been started in carcinoma of the pancreas using helium ions. Phase I-II studies are underway with heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions in order to prepare for prospective Phase III trials. Silicon ions are also under consideration for clinical trial. These studies are supported by the United States Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health

A number of potentially useful modalities are under study including combinations of debulking surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, hypoxic cell sensitizers and radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and multiple daily fractionation of photon irradiation. Radiotherapy with pions, helium and heavier charged particles have several advantageous characteristics for accomplishing this goal. At the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) we have been studying the use of radiotherapy with helium and heavier charged particles which have several advantageous characteristics for delivery of cancerocidal therapy to deep seated tumors. These include greater localization of the radiation dose to the target volume as well as potentially greater tumor cell-killing potency relative to normal cell damage: A significant lessening of the radiation protective effect of hypoxia on tumor cells may be expected when radiation exposures are made with ions heavier than atomic number 10. Heavy ions also depress enzymatic repair mechanisms, decrease variations in radiosensitivity during the cell division cycle, cause greater than expected delay in cell division and decrease the protective effects of neighbouring cells in organized systems. A potential clinical advantage may result from irradiation with heavy ions in the atomic number range of 10-15 if a significant difference in the above parameters can be found between normal tissues and tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

All patients had locally advanced disease without evidence of distant metastases. Partial compensation for tissue inhomogeneities was accomplished. Although palliation of symptoms and regression of tumor was commonly seen, local failure occurred in most patients (77%). The median survival was 8 months. It does not appear that an increase in tumor dose relative to normal tissues can be achieved that would be high enough to increase locoregional control rates over historical control rates with low-LET irradiation. Further studies will be carried out with heavier particles such as neon or silicon in hopes of achieving greater biological effect on these difficult-to-control tumors

During the course of this trial, treatment techniques have been developed and tumor doses have been escalated in order to obtain data on normal brain toxicity and response of malignant glioma of the brain. Toxicity has been acceptable with a low level of brain injury. Survival and tumor control has been approximately the same as historical results in glioma of the brain. Further dose escalation is planned together with possible trial of combined modality therapy

In tumors with "radioresistant" histologies, slow growth kinetics and/or hypoxic cells, the high-LET component of neon or silicon ions may also offer and added potential for increased effect on tumors. Sixty-seven (67) evaluable patients with tumors in the head and neck region having a histology other than squamous carcinoma received partial or full treatment with charged particles at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The tumor sites included base of skull or cervical spine, salivary glands, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, and miscellaneous sites such as lacrimal gland, soft tissues of the neck, or thyroid. Follow-up ranges from 1-9 years with a mean of 36 months and a median survival (Kaplan-Meier technique) of 50 months. The actuarial local control rate is 60% at 24 months post-treatment. Thirty-one (31) patients with squamous carcinoma of various sites in the head and neck have also been treated using charged particle irradiation; local control was lower (11 of 31 pts) and survival shorter (mean: 9 months) in this group of patients with advanced squamous carcinoma

By dividing the target volume into two or more portions and using a combination of beams, a reasonably homogeneous irradiation of the target volume can be obtained which protects critical CNS structures from over-irradiation. This technique requires knowledge of the physical and biological effects of charged particles, precise, reproducible patient immobilization, careful treatment planning based upon Metrizamide contrast CT and/or MRI scanning, compensation for tissue inhomogeneities, and accurate, verifiable radiation delivery. Uncertainties in the dose distribution must be taken into account when prescribing treatment. We have used this technique in 47 patients with a variety of tumors abutting the brain stem and spinal cord, including chordoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, osteosarcoma and metastatic tumors. The results have shown a significant local control rate (62%) and the incidence of serious complications has been acceptable (13%). The median follow-up is 20 months with a range of 6-90 months. We conclude that charged particles can be safely and effectively used to irradiate lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord to doses higher than can be achieved with low-LET irradiation	
1	2514	Experience in charged particle irradiation of tumors of the skull base: 1977-1992.[see comment]. [Review] [35 refs]	Adenocarcinoma, California, Californium, Female, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Ions, Male, Methods, Neon, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Sarcoma, Skull, Skull Base, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Universities	PURPOSE: To review the experience at University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in using charged particles to irradiate primary neoplasms of the skull base and those extending to the skull base from the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses. METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the period from 1977 to 1992, 223 patients were irradiated with charged particles at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for tumors either arising in or extending to the skull base, of whom 48 (22%) had recurrent lesions, either post previous surgery or radiotherapy. One hundred twenty-six patients had lesions arising in the cranial base, mostly chordoma (53), chondrosarcoma (27), paraclival meningioma (27) with 19 patients having other histologies such as osteosarcoma or neurofibrosarcoma. There were also 31 patients with primary or recurrent squamous carcinoma of the nasopharynx extending to the skull base, 44 patients with major or minor salivary gland tumors, mostly adenocarcinoma, and 22 patients with squamous carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses, all with cranial base extension. RESULTS: Local control and survival appeared improved in tumors arising in the skull base, following the ability with charged particles to deliver high doses (mean of 65 Gy-equivalent) with relative sparing of the adjacent normal tissues. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year local control was 85% for meningioma, 78% for chondrosarcoma, 63% for chordoma and 58% for other sarcoma. Follow-up ranged from 4-191 months with a median of 51 months. CONCLUSION: Charged particle radiotherapy is highly effective in controlling cranial base lesions which have have been partially resected. Better tumor localization with CT and MRI, improved 3-D treatment planning and beam delivery techniques have continued to reduce the level of serious complications and increase local control and survival.

1	2516	15 years experience with helium ion radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Survival, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To review the long-term experience of helium ion therapy as a therapeutic alternative to enucleation for uveal melanoma, particularly with respect to survival, local control, and morbidity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

The overall experiences can be summarized as follows: 1. A total neutron dose of 1560 cGy given in twelve equally spaced fractions over 20 days seems to be the optimum. Neutrons, therefore, provide a treatment option with great advantage with respect to patient management. 2. Rapid tumour regression is an important often ignored effect, leading to a quick relief of pain and other serious symptoms in the patient. 3. Due to the high incidence of complete regression complicated surgery can be avoided in many cases. Tissue deficits can be often covered by modern methods of surgery repair. 4. Local control rates are as high as 60 to 80% of the advanced tumours. They improve the quality of life and reduce the cost of continuing patients' care

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight adult patients with chordoma of the sacrum (23), base of skull (20) or mobile spine (5), were seen between 1958-1992. Forty-four were referred post operatively with overt disease and 31 of these were irradiated with conventionally fractionated radiation to a median dose of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks (range 25-60 Gy). Eight received a hyperfractionation protocol of 1 Gy, 4 hourly, 4 times a day (median 40 Gy/44 fractions/14 days), two sacral patients were treated with a hypofractionation protocol and three cases with skull base tumours were referred elsewhere for proton therapy. Endpoints measured were survival from diagnosis, objective response rate, symptomatic response rate and clinical or radiological progression-free survival from radiotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival was 62 months (range 4-240 month) from diagnosis with no difference between clival and non-clival presentations. One complete and no partial responses were identified in 23 assessable patients. A subjective response was recorded for 12/14 (85%) with pain and 10/23 (45%) with neurological signs or symptoms, and the median time to progression for those with overt disease was 35 months (range 5-220 months). There was no survival advantage to patients receiving radiation doses > 50 Gy (median 60 Gy) compared to doses < 50 Gy (median 40 Gy). There was no difference between the conventional or hyperfractionation regimens with respect to the degree or duration of symptomatic response, or in progression-free survival. Fourteen patients who progressed after irradiation were retreated with surgery (6), irradiation (7) or both modalities (1). Median survival after retreatment was 18 months, and the only two symptomatic responses seen were with reirradiation, and after failure of relatively low dose initial therapy. At last follow-up, 35 were dead of or with disease, seven are alive with disease, and two are disease-free. Thirty-eight had local disease persistence as the sole site of failure, and four developed distant metastases initially or subsequently. DISCUSSION: Overt residual chordoma is rarely cured with conventional external beam irradiation, but treatment does provide useful and prolonged palliation of pain for most patients. Chordoma is a disease with low metastatic potential, and better local control may improve survival. Complete resection rates may be improved for patients with sacral disease by using planned excisions in centres experienced in treating this rare disease. Because radiation therapy may prove to be more successful in controlling microscopic disease, it should be considered as a pre- or postoperative adjuvant to a macroscopically complete resection. Patients with skull base disease should also be resected in centres specializing in this surgery, but complete excision is unlikely. These patients will not obtain local control with conventional photon irradiation, and suitable patients should be considered for irradiation with stereotactic photon or particle beam therapy. For patients who progress after irradiation, there is limited symptomatic benefit to retreatment with surgery or reirradiation, and this should be limited to treating life-threatening complications

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 17-year-old male patient underwent corpus callosotomy conformal SRS using a dedicated linear accelerator (linac) with dynamic arcs technique. The prescribed dose was 36.0 Gy at the periphery of the rostrum, genu, and a half of the body of the corpus callosum (CCA). At 8 months after conformal SRS, the patient developed a significant brain edema and moderate transitory motor deficit, which were controlled with steroids. After 32 months follow-up, there is an improvement of 84% on drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal SRS for corpus callosotomy with a single isocenter reproduce the results reported on literature using Gamma Knife-based SRS. The results show that this technique is safe and demonstrate its efficacy to control seizures

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four treatment plans were compared in a prostate cancer patient aiming to deliver 81 Gy to the target: 1) conformal 18 MV X-rays, 6-fields; 2) 214 MeV protons, 2-fields; 3) IM 15 MV X-rays, 5-fields; and 4) 177-200 Mev IM protons, 5-fields as in Plan 3. In addition, IM methods were used to further escalate the tumor dose to 99 Gy. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used to physically compare the treatment plans. DVH data were also used to obtain normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the rectum, bladder, femoral heads, and tumor control probabilities. RESULTS: Although the planning target volume dose distribution was satisfactory with the four treatment plans, the homogeneity was slightly reduced in both X-ray plans (IM and standard) and the low-to-medium doses delivered to all organs at risk, and other normal tissues were significantly reduced by both proton plans. For a prescribed dose of 81 Gy, only the IM X-ray and IM proton plans both succeeded in predicting an acceptably low NTCP for the rectum (<5%, Grade 3). The integral nontarget dose was significantly reduced with IM proton beams (i.e., 3.1, 1.3, and 1.7 times less than Plans 1, 2, and 3, respectively). When escalating the dose to 99 Gy, no additional improvement between IM protons and IM X-ray beams was observed. CONCLUSION: Both IM X-ray and proton beams were able to optimize the dose distribution and comply with the goal of delivering the highest dose to the target while reducing the risk of severe morbidity to acceptable levels. The main advantage compared to IM X-rays was that IM protons succeeded in significantly reducing the low-to-medium dose to the nontarget tissues and achieved a small improvement in planning target volume (PTV) dose heterogeneity	
1	1119	Intravascular ultrasound study of the effect of beta-emitting ((55)Co) stents on vascular remodeling and intimal proliferation	Beta Rays, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Coronary Angiography, Coronary Restenosis/pc [Prevention & Control], Extremities, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radioactivity, Radioisotopes, Research, Stents, Tunica Intima/re [Radiation Effects], Ultrasonography,Interventional	The aim of this study was to evaluate vessel remodeling after implantation of high-activity (mean, 41.1 +/- 1.2 microCi) beta-emitting ((55)Co) stents. Proton bombarding in cyclotron has brought the radioactivity. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) investigation has been completed in 10 patients. The angiographies performed at 6 months revealed restenosis > 50% in five cases (50%). IVUS analysis demonstrated an absence of remodeling behind the stent, with no changes in total vessel volume (TVV; 353.6 +/- 126.3 and 343.9 +/- 90.6 mm(3)) or plaque + media volume (PMV; 171.7 +/- 57.4 and 166.8 +/- 42.6 mm(3)). On the other hand, lumen volume (LV) within the stent decreased significantly from 181.9 +/- 80.2 to 154.6 +/- 45.2 mm(3) (P < 0.02). This was due to presence of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) at both extremities of implanted stents. No chronic recoil of the implanted stents was found. The analysis of edges (5 mm distally and proximally to the last stent struts) showed no significant changes in TVV (187.3 +/- 62.60 and 176.9 +/- 53.5 mm(3)), but PMV increase significantly from 61.9 +/- 31.2 to 82.2 +/- 43.4 mm(3) (P < 0.04) and LV decreased from 125.2 +/- 40.7 to 94.7 +/- 22.0 mm(3) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, single (55)Co radioactive beta-emitting stents with high initial activity are effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia only within the stent body, as measured by IVUS, and they do not solve the problem of restenosis at the stent extremities as well as at the stent edges. Edge restenosis in this high radioactive stents was mainly (from 66%) due to neointimal proliferation. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc

Radiation therapy has been used for patients who cannot be operated on for medical reasons or who have a tumor that is technically difficult to resect or that cannot be resected because of its location. We performed the present study to evaluate the efficacy of megavoltage radiation in terms of lack of tumor progression and treatment-related morbidity. METHODS: Twenty patients who had giant-cell tumor of bone were managed with a single course of megavoltage radiation (forty to seventy gray administered at 1.8 to 2.0 gray per fraction with an average total duration of treatment of five to seven weeks) between March 1973 and March 1992. We used megavoltage photons, 160-megaelectron-volt proton beams, or a combination of the two. RESULTS: After a median duration of follow-up of 9.3 years, the tumor had not progressed in seventeen of the twenty patients. Thus, the actuarial ten-year rate for lack of progression was 85 percent. Local regrowth was evident in one patient who had received radiation alone and in two of the thirteen patients who had been managed with partial resection and radiation. Operative treatment was successful in the three patients in whom the radiation treatment had failed. No radiation-induced tumors were observed in our series. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that giant-cell tumor of bone was effectively treated with megavoltage radiation in our series of twenty patients in whom operative resection would have been difficult or was not feasible. The rate of tumors that did not progress with this regimen of radiation is similar to that reported by investigators from several other centers. Furthermore, these results closely rival those obtained with modern curettage procedures. Malignant sarcomatous transformation was not observed in our series. A longer duration of follow-up of a larger group of patients is necessary to provide a better estimate of the risk of malignant transformation

The authors evaluated whether these differences manifest themselves in the clinical outcome of patients and assessed the value of incorporating 1H-MRS imaging-derived spatial information into the treatment planning process for gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Twenty-six patients harboring Grade IV gliomas who had previously been treated with external-beam radiation therapy were evaluated by comparing the radiosurgically treated lesion volume with the volume of metabolically active tumor defined on 1H-MRS imaging. The cohort was evenly divided into two groups based on the percentage of overlap between the radiosurgical target and the metabolic lesion volumes. Patients with a percentage of overlap greater than 50% with respect to the metabolic lesion volume were classified as low risk and those with an overlap less than 50% were classified as high risk. Kaplan-Meier estimators were calculated using time to progression and survival as dependent variables. The metabolite levels within the metabolic lesion were significantly greater than those within the radiosurgical target (p < or = 0.001). The median survival was 15.7 months for patients in the low-risk group and 10.4 months for those in the high-risk group. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results of this study indicates that patients undergoing GKS may benefit from the inclusion of 1H-MRS imaging in the treatment planning process

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose-volume histograms were compared between photon, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton plans at doses of 66 Gy, 87.5 Gy in Stage I (n=10) and 60-63 Gy, and 74 Gy in Stage III (n=15). RESULTS: For Stage I, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 31.8%, 24.6%, and 15.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 66 Gy, whereas they were 13.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, with proton with dose escalation to 87.5 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (p=0.002). For Stage III, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 54.1%, 46.9%, and 34.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 63 Gy, whereas they were 39.7%, 36.6%, and 31.6%, respectively, for proton with dose escalation to 74 CGE (p=0.002). In all cases, the doses to lung, spinal cord, heart, esophagus, and integral dose were lower with proton therapy even compared with IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation, compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity

This instrument has several distinct advantages over frame-based systems, including improved patient comfort, increased treatment degrees of freedom, and the potential to target extracranial lesions. Clinical results thus far with respect to the treatment of malignant intracranial tumors has been promising. Additionally, the Cyberknife will likely revolutionize the application of radiosurgery to extracranial sites. A description of the components, treatment planning, and clinical results of the Cyberknife will be reviewed	
1	83	Stereotactic radiosurgery of angiographically occult vascular malformations: 14-year experience	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cerebral Angiography, Cerebral Hemorrhage/di [Diagnosis], Cerebral Hemorrhage/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), Postoperative Complications/di [Diagnosis], Postoperative Complications/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Reoperation, Research, Retrospective Studies	OBJECTIVE: Radiosurgery is generally effective in obliterating true arteriovenous malformations, but less is known about its effects on angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). Since July 1983, 57 patients with surgically inaccessible AOVMs of the brain were treated using helium ion (47 patients) or linear accelerator (10 patients) radiosurgery. This study retrospectively evaluates the response of these AOVMs to treatment. METHODS: All patients presented with previous hemorrhage. The mean patient age was 35.6 years (range, 13-71 yr). The mean AOVM volume was 2.25 cm3 (range, 0.080-15.2 cm3), treated with a mean of 18.0 Gy equivalent (physical dose x relative biological effectiveness, which is 1.3 for helium ion Bragg peak) (range, 7.0-40 Gy equivalent). The Drake scale scores before treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (26 patients), and poor (6 patients). The mean follow-up period was 7.5 years (range, 9 mo-13.8 yr). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (32%) bled symptomatically (20 hemorrhages) after radiosurgery. Sixteen hemorrhages occurred within 36 months after radiosurgery (9.4% annual bleed rate; 16 hemorrhages/171 patient yr); 4 hemorrhages occurred more than 36 months after treatment (1.6% annual bleed rate; 4 hemorrhages/257 patient yr) (P < 0.001). Complications included symptomatic radiation edema (four patients, 7%), necrosis (one patient, 2%), and increased seizure frequency (one patient, 2%). Eight patients underwent surgical resection of their AOVMs 8 to 59 months after radiosurgery because of subsequent hemorrhage. The Drake scale scores after treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (24 patients), poor (3 patients), and dead (5 patients, 3 of whom died as a result of causes unrelated to the AOVMs or radiosurgery). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery may be useful for AOVMs located in surgically inaccessible regions of the brain. A significant decrease in bleed rate exists more than 3 years after treatment compared with the bleed rate within 3 years of treatment. Because current neuroradiological techniques are not able to image obliterative response in these slow-flow vascular lesions, longer term clinical follow-up is required

Thirty-six of 30 patients either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Seventeen of 18 patients followed up for at least one year after therapy demonstrated tumor regression, with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 40%. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear.

Seventy-eight of 82 patients have either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Forty-five of 46 patients followed for at least 1 year after therapy have demonstrated tumor regression with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 31%. No tumor-related mortality has been observed. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear.

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

Thirty-one of 34 eyes were retained after treatment. Most melanomas were too large for surgical removal with retention of the eye. Eyes containing very large tumours often had poor visual acuity after treatment

Both helium ion irradiation and 125I brachytherapy have been used to treat this neoplasm. This investigation analyzed the control and complication rates of uveal melanomas treated with helium ions of 125I plaques. In both a retrospective and a prospective dynamically balanced study, the control rates appeared to be similar. There were more posterior segment complications after 125I plaques and more anterior segment complications, including neovascular glaucoma, after helium ion irradiation. The follow-up period is too short to draw definitive conclusions on the radiation complications. Overall, approximately 89% of eyes were retained and less than 4% of treated eyes were removed because of failure to control the tumor

Most uveal melanomas were large, with a mean tumor thickness of 6.5 mm; approximately 60% of the patients had tumors that extended anterior to the equator. A complete follow-up was obtained for all patients. One hundred twelve patients were alive at the time of this report; 18% of the patients developed clinical and laboratory evidence of metastases and eventually died of widespread tumor. Eighty-four percent of eyes were retained. Data were analyzed with a number of parametric and nonparametric techniques. Larger tumors and those located in close proximity to the optic nerve and fovea had a higher incidence of most complications, especially visual loss

METHODS: The authors prospectively studied helium-ion irradiation and iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy in a randomized, dynamically balanced trial. Of the 184 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 86 were treated with helium ions and 98 with 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: No patients with uveal melanoma had a history of systemic malignancy. Tumors were less than 15 mm in maximum diameter and less than 10 mm in thickness. A minimum tumor dose of 70 GyE was delivered to the tumor apex. There was a significantly higher local recurrence rate after 125I brachytherapy than after helium-ion irradiation. Enucleations occurred more frequently after brachytherapy (relative risk = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-5.78). More anterior segment complications occurred after helium-ion irradiation. To date, there has been no measurable impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: Most uveal melanomas can be managed with radiation with retention of the eye. There was better tumor control with helium-ion irradiation; however, there were more anterior segment complications

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 426 ciliochoroidal melanomas that met COMS inclusion criteria for randomisation to enucleation versus radioactive plaque but were treated with either helium ions or 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: At 3 years 36.0% of eyes had 6/12 or better visual acuity. The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision

METHODS: Retrospective review of 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. Several parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis techniques were used. RESULTS: In 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma, the mean dimension for largest basal diameter was 11.9 mm (range 5 mm to 24 mm). The mean tumor thickness was 6.7 mm (range 1.3 mm to 14.2 mm). Following helium ion radiation 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. At 10 years after radiation 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes were enucleated; the majority (37 of 46) of enucleations were due to anterior ocular segment complications. At 10 years after radiation 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; half had non-tumor related deaths and 51 died from metastatic melanoma. Best corrected visual acuity after radiation was > or = 20/40 in 21 of 93 eyes of patients that were alive and retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors that were less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm away from the nerve or the fovea, 13 of 18 (72%) retained > or = 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of acuity. The actuarial enucleation rate at 5 years was 17.2% (2.7% S.E.) and at 10 years this was 22.4% (3.1% S.E). The recurrence tumor control rate at both 5 and 10 years was 5.3% (S.E 1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion radiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In tumors that are less than 6 mm in thickness and greater than 3 mm from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision. Approximately one-half of the deaths 10 years after treatment were due to non-tumor-related causes

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment.

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

Consequently, we might observe liberation of metallic debris and wear. Our purpose is to measure the contamination and the migration of these metallic elements in the surrounding tissues of the implant. Two types of samples have been studied. First type is sample taken on post-mortem tissues around prostheses to study contamination gradients. Second type is sample taken on pathologic joints on periprosthetic capsular tissues in surgical conditions. These allow estimating contamination degree. The experiments were made on a Van de Graaff accelerator located at CERI (Centre d'Etude et de Recherche par Irradiation, Orleans, France). We measure elemental concentrations resulting from the contamination of the surface of each sample. Results are analysed in function of the pathology and the type of implants. According to the pathology and the location of the sampling, these measurements show a very heterogeneous contamination by metallic elements under particles and/or ionic species which can migrate through soft tissues by various mechanisms

This conjunctival melanoma arose from primary acquired melanosis with atypia at the temporal corneoscleral limbus. The patient was treated using a combination of surgical excision with physical treatment by ocular proton therapy. Progression remained under control 11 months after treatment: no local tumour recurrence or metastasis was observed. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia must be regarded as a premalignant melanocytic lesion. Based on this case report, the authors focus on primary acquired melanosis and its risk of transformation to a conjunctival malignant melanoma

1	1039	Matching the dosimetry characteristics of a dual-field Stanford technique to a customized single-field Stanford technique for total skin electron therapy	Air, Electrons, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Head, Humans, Lymphoma,T-Cell,Cutaneous/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Whole-Body Irradiation/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To compare the dosimetry characteristics of a customized single-field and a matching dual-field electron beam for total skin electron therapy (TSET) within the framework of the Stanford technique. To examine and quantify its impact on patient dosimetry. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two characteristically different electron beams were used for TSET employing the Stanford technique: a single-field beam created from a pencil beam of electrons passing through 7 meters of air and a dual-field beam created from two heavily scattered electron beams directed at oblique angles to patients. The dosimetry characteristics of the two beams were measured by using ionization chambers, radiographic films, and thermal luminescent detectors. The impact of beam characteristic on patient dosimetry was quantified on both anthromorphic phantoms and on patients. Treatment protocols aimed at matching the patient dose between the two systems were established on the basis of these and other measurements. RESULTS: The dual-field beam was matched to the single-field beam, resulting in approximately the same mean energy (approximately 4.0 MeV) and most probable energy (approximately 4.5 MeV) at their respective treatment source-to-patient-surface distance (SSD). The depth dose curves on the beam axis were nearly identical for both beams. X-ray contamination on the beam axis was 0.43% for the dual-field beam, slightly higher than that (0.4%) of the single-field beam. The beam uniformity, however, was quite different: the dual-field beam was more uniform in the vertical direction but was worse in the lateral direction compared to the single-field beam. For a TSET treatment using the Stanford technique, the composite depth dose curves were nearly identically at the level of beam axis: with an effective depth of maximum buildup (d(max)) at approximately 1 mm below the skin surface and the depth to 80% depth dose at around 6 mm. The overall X-ray contamination was approximately 1.0% and 1.2% for the single-field and dual-field system, respectively. Away from the beam axis level, treatment using either beam was able to deliver over 90% of prescription dose to the main body surfaces. For body surfaces tangential to the beam axis (e.g., top of head and shoulders), the dose was low especially when using the dual-field beam. By adding boost radiation to the tangential surfaces and by adjusting the planned shielding for critical structures, the total dose to the patient over a complete course of TSET treatment could be matched closely for the two systems. CONCLUSIONS: Although the depth doses can be matched at the level of the beam axis, there exist some characteristic differences in the angular distribution of the electrons between the large SSD single-field beam and the short SSD dual-field beam. These differences resulted in lower dose delivered to "tangential" body surfaces and to body structures that extended farther laterally when using the dual-field beam. However, by adjusting the treatment protocol regarding the boost irradiation and planned shielding, the total dose to patients from a complete course of TSET treatment using the dual-field beam can be matched to that given by the single-field beam. Special attention should be paid to the dosimetry at the "tangential" body surfaces when commissioning a dual-field TSET system

In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery	
0	225	Metabolic characteristics of intracranial metastases, detected by single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are seemingly not predictive for tumor response to gamma knife radiosurgery	Aged, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast, Carcinoma/di [Diagnosis], Carcinoma/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma/su [Surgery], Energy Metabolism/ph [Physiology], Female, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Metastasis/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Metastasis/pp [Physiopathology], Neoplasm Metastasis/th [Therapy], Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Protons, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome	Metabolic characteristics of intracranial metastases, detected with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) have known associations with clinical predictors of tumor response to radiosurgery. Therefore, it can be suspected that the metabolic profile of the neoplasm by itself might have some prognostic significance for the outcome after irradiation. Twenty-six intracranial metastases, which underwent metabolic evaluation with single-voxel 1H-MRS before gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) and were followed for at least 3 months after treatment, were selected for retrospective analysis. The tumors most frequently originated from the lungs (9 cases), breast (7 cases), colon and rectum (5 cases). The average volume of the investigated intracranial neoplasm was 5.4+/-2.0 mL. The average marginal irradiation dose was 18.6+/-2.3 Gy. The mean follow-up after GKR constituted 8.0+/-5.5 months. Tumor response to GKR was identified in 13 cases on average 2.2+/-1.8 months after treatment. Local recurrence was marked in 10 cases on average 8.7+/-4.1 months after treatment. None of the investigated 1H-MRS metabolic parameters of intracranial metastases showed a statistically significant association with the outcome after GKR. The negative results of the present study make doubtful the predictive value of metabolic characteristics of intracranial metastases, detected with single-voxel 1H-MRS, for the outcome after radiosurgery

Eighty-five brain metastases in 81 patients were investigated before treatment and 16-18h thereafter. Standard metabolic ratios, namely N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), phosphorylcholine/glycerophosphorylcholine (Cho)/Cr, NAA/Cho, lactate (Lac)/Cr, and mobile lipids (Lip)/Cr, were calculated, and comparison of their values before and after irradiation was done. No volumetric changes of any neoplasm were found in any case on the next day after treatment. At the same time, significant reduction of Cho/Cr (P < 0.001) and NAA/Cr (P < 0.01) ratios on the proton MRS of the tumor was disclosed. Reduction of Cho/Cr ratio was significantly more prominent in neoplasms with higher pretreatment Cho/Cr ratios (P < 0.001) and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (P < 0.01). Reduction of NAA/Cr ratio was predominantly determined by its pretreatment value (P < 0.001). The observed decrease of Cho/Cr ratio probably reflects inhibition of proliferative activity and early apoptotic cell loss, whereas reduction of NAA/Cr may result from radiation-induced modulation of neuronal activity in the peritumoral brain tissue. Serial proton MRS represents a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of metabolic changes in intracranial neoplasms after radiosurgical treatment

The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed 162 patients having 192 HCCs treated from November 1985 to July 1998 by proton beam therapy with or without transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. The patients in the present series were considered unsuitable for surgery for various reasons, including hepatic dysfunction, multiple tumors, recurrence after surgical resection, and concomitant illnesses. The median total dose of proton irradiation was 72 Gy in 16 fractions over 29 days. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for all of the 162 patients was 23.5% at 5 years. The local control rate at 5 years was 86.9% for all 192 tumors among the 162 patients. The degree of impairment of hepatic functions attributable to coexisting liver cirrhosis and the number of tumors in the liver significantly affected patient survival. For 50 patients having least impaired hepatic functions and a solitary tumor, the survival rate at 5 years was 53.5%. The patients had very few acute reactions to treatments and a few late sequelae during and after the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC is effective, safe, well tolerable, and repeatable. It is the useful treatment mode for either cure or palliation for patients with HCC irrespective of tumor size, tumor location in the liver, insufficient feeding of the tumor with arteries, presence of vascular invasion, impaired hepatic functions, and coexisting intercurrent diseases	
0	2559	Intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations. [Review] [18 refs]	Adult, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pp [Physiopathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Intracranial Pressure, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Pressure, Radiation, Steroids, Visual Fields, Women	Only 6 patients with intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations have been reported. We report 6 additional patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic during the past 10 years. The average age was 28 years (range, 19-44 years); 4 were women. Symptoms and signs included papilledema (6 patients), headache (6), transient nonepileptic focal symptoms (4), visual obscurations (3), ipsilateral carotid or ocular bruits (3), abnormal visual fields (3), focal seizures (2), and progressive visual loss (1). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the malformations in all 6 patients. The malformations were large, supplied by the branches of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with the posterior cerebral artery contributing in 3 patients, and all drained into the superior sagittal sinus. Associated venous obstruction was seen in 2 patients. Four patients underwent excision of the arteriovenous malformation, with resolution of papilledema in all 4. Measurements of cortical arterial and venous pressures during surgery in 3 patients showed decreased feeding artery pressures and elevated draining vein pressures, which normalized after removal of the malformation. Treatment in the 2 remaining patients consisted of medical therapy (acetazolamide, furosemide, steroids) alone in 1 patient, and in conjunction with proton beam radiation in the other. Papilledema resolved in the former patient, but the patient receiving proton beam radiation still had papilledema 2 years later. Intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations occurs in young patients with high flow malformations that drain into the superior sagittal sinus, and is likely the result of increased cortical venous and superior sagittal sinus pressure. Excision of the malformation effectively reduces the intracranial pressure. [References: 18]	
1	1856	Effects of proton beam irradiation on uveal melanomas: a comparative study of Ki-67 expression in irradiated versus non-irradiated melanomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Case-Control Studies, Chi-Square Distribution, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Fibrosis, Follow-Up Studies, France, Humans, Ki-67 Antigen/an [Analysis], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/im [Immunology], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mitotic Index, Neoplasm Proteins/an [Analysis], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Recurrence, Statistics,Nonparametric, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/im [Immunology], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	AIMS: To assess the cellular proliferation using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, in paraffin embedded uveal melanomas irradiated by proton beam, as well as in non-irradiated uveal melanomas. METHODS: 30 enucleated eyes were included for histopathological study and Ki-67 immunostaining. Patients were enucleated between 1991 and 1996 for uveal melanoma, 14 after proton beam irradiation and 16 without treatment (control group). The mean follow up period was 2.5 years after diagnosis and 1 year after enucleation. RESULTS: A significant relation was found between Ki-67 score and mitotic index (r = 0.56, p = 0.001), histological largest tumour diameter (r = 0.38, p = 0. 03), fibrosis (r = -0.35, p = 0.05), absence of tumoral pigmentation (p = 0.05), and presence of vascular thrombosis (p = 0.03). The Ki-67 score was significantly higher in the non-irradiated group (p = 0.01) and in the group of patients whose cause of enucleation was tumoral evolution (p = 0.005) compared with the group of patients enucleated after neovascular glaucoma. The Ki-67 score was very high in a case of orbital recurrence of uveal melanoma and metastatic death. 70% of metastasised tumours showed a Ki-67 score higher than the median value. CONCLUSION: Ki-67 labelling is a reliable method of estimating the proliferative activity in uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation. The Ki-67 score is significantly correlated with prognostic variables (mitotic index and histological largest tumour diameter), and with radiation effects after proton beam irradiation

In this study, quality assurance for FSRT of 58 cases, between August 1995 and August 1997 are described, and the errors for each step and overall accuracy were estimated. Some of the important items for FSRT procedures are: accuracy in CT localization, transferred image distortion, laser alignment, isocentric accuracy of linear accelerator, head frame movement, portal verification, and various human errors. A geometric phantom, that has known coordinates was used to estimate the accuracy of CT localization. A treatment planning computer was used for checking the transferred image distortion. The mechanical isocenter standard (MIS), rectilinear phantom pointer: (RLPP), and laser target localizer frame (LTLF) were used for laser alignment and target coordinates setting. Head-frame stability check was performed by a depth confirmation helmet (DCH). A film test was done to check isocentric accuracy and portal verification. All measured data for the 58 patients were recorded and analyzed for each item. 4-MV x-rays from a linear accelerator, were used for FSRT, along with homemade circular cones with diameters from 20 to 70 mm (interval: 5 mm). The accuracy in CT localization was 1.2+/-0.5 mm. The isocentric accuracy of the linear accelerator, including laser alignment, was 0.5+/-0.2 mm. The reproducibility of the head frame was 1.1+/-0.6 mm. The overall accuracy was 1.7+/-0.7 mm, excluding human errors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (1H MRS) examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers for comparison with data from the patient population. There were 18 patients (28 spectra) with radiologic evidence of TLN and all patients were confirmed cases of NPC treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment while 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. All 1H MRS examinations were performed on a 2-T whole body system (Bruker) using the point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method with TE = 135 ms, TR = 3000 ms, and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. RESULTS: The N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels were reduced in all except one spectrum (96%). Choline (Cho) was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine (Cr) level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. In four patients with normal imaging findings 1H MRS was abnormal. CONCLUSION: 1H MRS can characterize radiation-induced TLN. Spectra with increased Cho can be mistaken for neoplasm. Spectroscopy can also identify metabolic derangement before imaging

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

The most effective approaches to therapy of oropharyngeal tumors with account of their site, spread and degrees of differentiation were developed. The most effective method was shown to be the combination of gamma-beam therapy (50 Gy) with electron-photon radiation (20 Gy) of an accelerator of 18-20 MeV, radiation exposure of normal tissues being lowered by approximately 10-20% as compared to that in gamma-beam therapy used alone. The use of the above method in 45 oropharyngeal cancer patients resulted in an immediate clinical effect (disappearance of a tumor and regional metastases (if any) in 60% of the patients. The 2-year survival rate calculated by actuarial curves, was 62 +/- 10%

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

This is particularly evident in patients with useful hearing, in whom fractionated RT offers the potential for hearing preservation. Our objective was to determine the disease control, hearing preservation (via audiograms), and toxicity rates after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiation for acoustic neuroma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 72 acoustic neuroma patients underwent stereotactic irradiation and had at least 6 months of follow-up between October 1997 and March 2002. Of these, 45 received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 27 received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Before treatment, all SRS patients were functionally deaf and 23 of 25 SRT patients had useful hearing in the affected ear. The minimal peripheral dose was 12 Gy and 45 Gy in all SRS and SRT patients, respectively. Tumor control, toxicity, and hearing preservation were recorded. RESULTS: The median follow-up in the SRS and SRT groups was 27 and 26 months, respectively. No tumor progression was seen after SRS and SRT. On the basis of the audiogram criteria, the 1-year and 2-year hearing preservation rate was 85% and 57%, respectively. The mean pre- and post-SRT speech recognition threshold was 20 and 38 dB, respectively. The mean proportion of pre- and post-SRT speech discrimination was 91% and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic RT achieves good local control, with acceptable toxicity. RT fractionation appears to provide encouraging rates of hearing preservation

These irradiations employing a specially formed beam are used on a routine basis and are performed in parallel with the program of physical research. Two additional channels as well as two new procedure rooms have been in operation since 1982. A special setup of equipment including clinical dosimetry devices, equipment for patients' irradiation (4 special units), and computer-controlled systems have been installed at the facility. By the present time over 1300 patients have been irradiated. The authors describe physical and dosimetric equipment and irradiation techniques.

There was concern that the technique using Co-60 and turning the patient over for the posterior field may not be optimal as it was felt that the axillary areas of these patients were being under-dosed. A variety of treatment set-ups were performed on a 60-Cobalt unit at extended SSD. The phantom was planned for treatment lying supine for the anterior field and prone for the posterior field. Measurements were made in the neck, hilum and axillae using various combinations of compensators and lead filters. The combination of full field compensators and a lead filter gave the best results in the phantom but did not give satisfactory axillary readings in the patient situation. This was attributed to the difference in shape and AP separation of the patient when lying prone. RANDO, being solid, retains its shape. Treatment was then planned for a 6 MV linear accelerator using a vertical couch extender which enables the patient to remain supine throughout the treatment by increasing the table height to allow the posterior portal to be treated through the couch. Full field compensation was found to give an adequate dose to all the measured areas. This technique has since been performed on 28 patients being treated for Hodgkins disease at the Hillbrow Hospital, and the average axillary dose recorded in these patients is 88.6% of the prescribed dose

In the present study, a further step was made, aiming at the improvement of the effectiveness of in vivo dosimetry, based on a real-time check of the dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Entrance dose was determined using micro-MOSFET detectors placed inside a thin, sterile, transparent catheter. The epoxy side of the detector was faced towards the beam to minimize the anisotropy. Each detector was plugged into a bias supply (standard sensitivity) and calibrated at 5 Gy using 6 MeV electrons produced by a conventional linac. Detectors were characterized in terms of linearity, precision and dose per pulse dependence. No energy and temperature dependence was found. The sensitivity change of detectors was about 1% per 20 Gy accumulated dose. Correction factors to convert surface to entrance dose were determined for each combination of energy and applicator. From November 2004 to May 2005, in vivo dosimetry was performed on 45 patients affected by early-stage breast cancer, who underwent IOERT to the tumour bed. IOERT was delivered using electrons (4-10 MeV) at high dose per pulse, produced by either a Novac7 or a Liac mobile linac. RESULTS: The mean ratio between measured and expected dose was 1.006+/-0.035 (1 SD), in the range 0.92-1.1. The procedure uncertainty was 3.6%. Micro-MOSFETs appeared suitable for in vivo dosimetry in IOERT, although some unfavourable aspects, like the limited lifetime and the anisotropy with no build-up, were found. Prospectively, a real-time action level (+/-6%) on dose discrepancy was defined. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent agreement between measured and expected doses was found. Real-time in vivo dosimetry appeared feasible, reliable and more effective than the method previously published

One case exhibited a posterior form, presenting with progressive hyperopia from a serous-macular detachment and choroidal involvement along with retrobulbar involvement. This patient was treated with proton beam irradiation. Two cases displayed an anterior form, with fixed fleshy epibulbar masses resembling salmon patches, and choroidal involvement. The histologic findings from biopsy of these anterior masses are presented. One of these patients was treated with complete excision of the mass and double freeze-thaw cryotherapy of the scleral bed, and the other patient was treated with conventional photon beam irradiation. The clinical features of uveal lymphoid neoplasia in its early form are discussed. Evaluation and treatment strategies for these early forms of uveal lymphoid neoplasia are reviewed

METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects with subfoveal CNVM due to AMD were randomly assigned to 16-Gy proton irradiation delivered in two fractions 24 hours apart or to sham control treatment. Recruitment was halted at 37 subjects for ethical reasons regarding randomization to sham treatment when Food and Drug Administration approval of Visudyne was anticipated. RESULTS: Proton irradiation was associated with a trend toward stabilization of visual acuity, but this association did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found within the fluorescein angiography data, including greatest linear dimension of CNVM total size, area of active leakage, area of associated subretinal hemorrhage, and intensity. CONCLUSIONS: With the acceptance of photodynamic therapy, future studies will require more complex design and larger sample size to determine whether radiation can play either a primary or adjunctive role in treating these lesions

In theory, it is possible to selectively irradiate a tumor and the associated infiltrating tumor cells with large single doses of high-LET radiation while sparing the adjacent normal tissues. The mixture of high- and low-LET dose components created in tissue during neutron irradiation complicates the radiobiology of BNCT. Much of the complexity has been unravelled through a combination of preclinical experimentation and clinical dose escalation experience. Over 350 patients have been treated in a number of different facilities worldwide. The accumulated clinical experience has demonstrated that BNCT can be delivered safely but is still defining the limits of normal brain tolerance. Several independent BNCT clinical protocols have demonstrated that BNCT can produce median survivals in patients with glioblastoma that appear to be equivalent to conventional photon therapy. This review describes the individual components and methodologies required for effect BNCT: the boron delivery agents; the analytical techniques; the neutron beams; the dosimetry and radiation biology measurements; and how these components have been integrated into a series of clinical studies. The single greatest weakness of BNCT at the present time is non-uniform delivery of boron into all tumor cells. Future improvements in BNCT effectiveness will come from improved boron delivery agents, improved boron administration protocols, or through combination of BNCT with other modalities.

These include patients with advanced nonresectable tumors in many different sites treated with a variety of neutron beam generators varying widely in beam energy. Protocols were largely nonrandomized and included both mixed beam studies (neutrons + photons) and neutrons alone in varying doses. In spite of wide variation in equipment, treatment technique, and philosophy, some consistent trends have been identified: (1) in general, the neutron results have been at least as good as those of the photon controls measured in terms of local control, although the incidence of significant side effects have been higher; (2) in none of the randomized studies conducted so far, largely comprising epidermoid carcinomas of the head and neck, has a clear survival advantage for neutrons over photon controls been demonstrated at a statistically significant level; (3) results with mixed beam studies have been uniformly equivocal, with marginally significant differences in favor of the experimental groups compared with the photon controls; (4) adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, including tumors of the salivary gland, pancreas, stomach, and bowel, appear to be responsive to high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation; (5) nonepidermoid, radioresistant tumors (sarcoma of bone and soft tissue and melanoma) yield a consistantly high local control rate, with neutron irradiation strikingly superior to those reported with photon therapy; and (6) in the central nervous system, both normal tissues and tumors appear to be exceptionally sensitive to neutron irradiation, therapeutic ratios are small, and the prospect of cure remains remote. It is concluded that neutrons are efficacious for certain specific tumor types, but that essentially new study designs, based on nonrandomized matched case comparisons, will be required to prove the merit of the new modality

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A homogeneous group of 136 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate were treated with the Fermilab high-energy neutron beam at three dose levels: 19, 20.4, and 21 Gy, using the same treatment plan and fractionation scheme for all patients. RESULTS: Tumor control rates were about 83% at the three dose levels studied. However, the normal tissue complication rate (late sequelae) varied with dose: 0 out of 5 at 19 Gy, 5 out of 58 (8.6%) at 20.4 Gy, and 9 out of 73 (12.3%) at 21 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron therapy to the pelvis reveals a steep dose-response function for late effects with a coefficient of variation of only 11%. This is lower than that usually observed with photons or with less uniform clinical data sets, and may be characteristic for well-planned high-LET radiotherapy

The data were collected in 1984-1985 by the Patterns of Care Study Survey of Palliative Care conducted in 49 institutions selected to provide valid national averages for the practice patterns reported. Data were collected from 784 patient records selected from five "strata" of practice. Demographic data and process data were tabulated and national averages were calculated from the data. Four metastatic sites were selected, weight bearing bones (401), non-weight bearing bones (102), brain metastasis (224), and lung-mediastinum (57). The median patient age was 63 years, equally divided by sex. In 52% of patients this was the first metastasis. Common Karnofsky performance scores ranged from 40 to 80%. Lung, breast, and prostate were the most common primaries. Two-thirds of the patients were treated by linear accelerators, one-third by cobalt. The median number of fractions was 10, median dose 3000 cGy, median fraction size 300 cGy, and median treatment duration 15 days. The goal of treatment was relief of pain (98%) and return of function (30%) for weight bearing bones, for brain metastasis it was preservation of function (68%), pain relief (33%), and relief of compression (25%). All sites showed TDF values that ranged from 33-85, and a TDF of approximately 65 was most common for weight bearing bones and brain metastasis with no consistent pattern of TDF selection for the other sites.

0	200	Multiple fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of residual pituitary macroadenomas: initial experience	Adenoma/pa [Pathology], Adenoma/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Pituitary Gland,Anterior/pa [Pathology], Pituitary Gland,Anterior/su [Surgery], Pituitary Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: We describe our initial experience with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for the treatment of 19 patients with secretory and nonsecretory pituitary macroadenomas. The primary endpoints of local control and the documentation of any MRI T2-weighted changes in contiguous brain tissues are discussed. METHODS: Between 1/95 and 1/97, 19 patients were planned with the X-Knife 3-D planning system (Radionics, Burlington, Mass., USA) and received a median dose of 46 Gy in daily 2.0-Gy fractions. Treatments were delivered stereotactically with a dedicated 600SR linear accelerator (Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Immobilization was achieved with the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame. The mean tumor size was 2.24 cm. The mean prescription isodose was 87%. The mean age was 53 years (10 male, 9 female). The mean follow-up time was 10 months (range 1-24 months). The mean optic chiasm and brain stem doses were calculated at 38 and 13 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postgadolinum-enhanced MRI scans and Humphrey visual field tests. RESULTS: In the posttreatment period, local control (absence of tumor progression) has been achieved in all of the patients. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. No acute complications, no visual changes and no T2-weighted MRI or proton density changes were documented in any of the 19 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that SRT compares favorably with conventional radiotherapy in achieving local control. The doses to the brainstem and the temporal lobes are significantly decreased and at early follow-up no white matter changes are seen on MRI after SRT. The true frequency of grade 1-4 changes are likely underestimated as similar changes often occur in association with tumor edema or after surgery. Given the uncertain neurocognitive significance of the white matter changes associated with treating these benign tumors by conventional radiotherapy, we are currently treating all pituitary adenomas with fractionated SRT to reduce the potential sequelae

The initial results with orthovoltage (280 kV) therapy were unpredictable, but 30 patients with 32 tumors treated with megavoltage radiotherapy (Cobalt-60 [60Co] or linear accelerator) have shown either no evidence of recurrence or complications, with one exception, or died of causes unrelated to their glomus tumor. Megavoltage radiotherapy is recommended for primary treatment of all glomus tumors that present with evidence of bone invasion or nerve involvement

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordomas is a challenge. In this study the authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordomas and 10 patients with chondrosarcomas. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact, log rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%. respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordomas) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam therapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively, at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with the worst RFS rates compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively, at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy followed by those with cerebrospinal fluid leakages were the most frequent postoperative complications. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and patient age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam therapy provided better prognoses for these patients

Assessment was made in a retrospective analysis, noting influence of age, stage of disease at presentation, initial histology, dose of radiotherapy given and any subsequent treatment required, recorded up to October 1986. From this it will be seen that the development of a six fraction regime, given over a period of three weeks leads to comparable results to other reported series, whether assessed as a local response or by survival curves, and to the economical use of scarce resources, but even more important, is less wearing for patients than daily fractionation, with early and late morbidity being within acceptable limits	
1	2591	Stereotactic radiosurgery utilizing a linear accelerator	Adolescent, Adult, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	The authors have developed a radiosurgical technique based on multiple arc irradiations. The target is fixed to the rotational isocenter of a Varian 4 MV linear accelerator. The first irradiation is carried out while the radiating source is rotating on a 100-140 degrees arc. The patient is then rotated around a vertical axis passing through the target, and arc irradiations are repeated in different angular positions. By this technique it is possible to obtain very steep dose gradients at the borders of the target volume. High doses are usually delivered in two shots. 47 patients have been treated so far in a clinical trial that started in November 1982. The paper deals with the preliminary results (more than 6 months' follow-up) obtained in patients affected by nonresectable brain tumors and AVMs

The irradiation is carried out along 9-17 non-coplanar arcs distributed on a 160 degrees cylindrical sector. High doses (10-50 Gy) are delivered in one or two sessions. From 1982, 65 patients have been treated (shortest follow-up 6 months). The dose was chosen according to the pathology and to the volume of the lesion. Good clinical results have been obtained in low-grade gliomas, acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and other selected types of intracranial lesions. Therapeutic effects in terms of clinical condition and size of the lesions have been plotted in relation to time elapsed and dose employed

Follow-up ranges from 1 to 100 months (mean 42 months). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 47% of treated patients at one year and 80% at 2 years. 17 haemorrhages were observed after treatment and 6 patients died from them. No bleeding took place after complete angiographic obliteration. 11 patients suffered for radionecrosis. In 6 patients complete recovery was obtained with corticoid medication. The aim of this study is to present our results and to evaluate the effect of irradiation on the risk of bleeding after radiosurgery. Patients were considered at risk in the time lapse after irradiation and before angiographic obliteration or other definitive treatment or death. Patients were followed from the date of radiosurgery and the number of haemorrhages were recorded every six months. In our series the bleeding risk in patients harbouring incompletely obliterated AVMs decreases from 8% in the first year after radiosurgery to 0% starting from the 24th month of the follow-up

Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects

Series patients uniformly refused enucleation both at an outside institution and again as a treatment option after extensive discussion at the University of California, San Francisco. DESIGN: In a retrospective, nonrandomized cohort study, 21 patients with extra-large choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanomas measuring at least 10 mm in maximum thickness or 20 mm in maximum basal diameter or tumors located within 3 mm of the optic nerve measuring at least 8 mm in maximum thickness or 16 mm in maximum basal diameter met inclusion criteria. Main outcome measures were frequency of (1) anterior segment complications (lash loss, keratopathy, cataract, and neovascular glaucoma), (2) posterior segment complications (vitreous hemorrhage, radiation retinopathy, and radiation papillopathy), (3) treatment failure (tumor growth, enucleation, or metastases), and (4) final visual acuity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Mean age at treatment was 58.3 years. The frequencies of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 14.3% and 9.5%, respectively. Mean tumor thickness and mean basal diameter were 8.6 mm and 18.7 mm, respectively. Lash loss occurred in 52.4%; dry eye, in 23.8%; cataract, in 28.6%; neovascular glaucoma, in 38.1% (100% in patients with diabetes mellitus); radiation retinopathy, in 9.5%; and radiation papillopathy, in 9.5%. No patient developed radiation-associated scleral necrosis or vitreous hemorrhage. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of local tumor growth after treatment was 33%, and the rate of distant metastasis was 10%. Visual acuity of 20/200 or better was preserved in 25% of patients, including 4 patients (19%) who experienced an average of 4 lines of Snellen visual acuity improvement. Development of neovascular glaucoma was associated with tumors in close proximity to the optic nerve (P = .04), while cataract (P = .03) and lash loss (P = .02) occurred with more anteriorly located tumors. Proton beam radiotherapy provided a 67% probability of local control and 90% probability of clinically discernible metastases-free survival at 24 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy is an ocular-conserving option that may be considered for the treatment of extra-large uveal melanoma in carefully selected patients

One day after the completion of therapy, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, headache, and postural hypotension. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a marked fall of the previously elevated urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) and undetectable plasma cortisols. The urinary 17-OHCS transiently returned to supranormal levels but over a 2 1/2-week period decreased and then remained low. The patient also demonstrated a subnormal urinary aldosterone excretion in relation to plasma renin activity (PRA) during 10 mEq/24 h sodium restriction. The remainder of the endocrine evaluation was normal, suggesting that pituitary function otherwise remained intact. One and one-half years after alpha-particle therapy, the patients's urinary 17-OHCS were normal and responded normally to metyrapone. The relationship between urinary aldosterone excretion and PRA also was normal. It is postulated that there was an infarction of an ACTH secreting pituitary tumor leaving the remainder of the pituitary intact. Achronically elevated circulating level of ACTH with sudden loss of ACTH secretion appeared to have been responsible for the initial low urinary aldosterone as well as the low urinary 17-OHCS. This is the first reported case of a presumed pituitary tumor infarction in association with alpha-particle pituitary radiation

Forty of these 45 patients received at least 6000 cGy. The 5 and 10 year actuarial survival rates were 31 and 20%. Four patients are currently alive without evidence of disease at least 10 years after treatment. Local persistence or recurrence of tumor in the nasopharynx was the primary cause of failure and occurred in 42% of our patients. The likelihood of this type of treatment failure correlated with the initial "T stage" of disease. Inability to control nodal disease was less common, occurring in 23% of evaluable patients and was proportional to the "N stage." Distant metastases became apparent in 13% of our patients and correlated with the "N stage." More than 90% of recurrences were evident within two and all occurred within three years of treatment

The model illustrates the relationships among the relevant variables: the patient waiting time, the number on the waiting list, the rate at which requests for radiation therapy are received and the rate at which courses of treatment are commenced. In particular, the rate at which the waiting time increases is equal to the difference between the request rate and the start rate, expressed as a fraction of the start rate, and is therefore a measure of the deficiency in service capacity of a facility. A study of the records of patients treated on the linear accelerators of the Tom Baker Cancer Centre from January 1991 to June 1994 shows that this relationship holds to a high degree of accuracy for average values of the various parameters in spite of the considerable variation in these values, and particularly variation in the individual waiting times. This finding suggests that such an approach would be useful in assessing and comparing the performance of radiation therapy facilities

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

Since that time, over 1000 patients have completed treatments and the facility currently treats more than 45 patients per day. With a typical intensity of 3 x 10(10) protons per pulse and 27 pulses per minute, dose rates of 90-100 cGy/min are easily achieved on a 20-cm diameter field. In most cases, patient treatment times are 2 min, much less than the patient alignment time required before each treatment. Nevertheless, there is considerable medical interest in increasing field sizes up to 40-cm diameter while keeping dose rates high and treatment times low. In this article, beam measurements relevant to intensity studies are presented and possible accelerator modifications for upgrades are proposed. It is shown that nearly all intensity losses can be ascribed to the large momentum spread of the injected beam and occur at or near the injection energy of 2 MeV. The agreement between calculations and measurements appears quite good. In addition, optimum beam characteristics for a new injector are discussed based upon the momentum acceptance and space charge limits of the Loma Linda synchrotron

Irradiation with moderately high doses results in responses in 40%-65% of all patients. With irradiation to a level of at least 6000 rad in 30 fractions in 6 weeks, greater than 60% of patients never fail in the chest. Some of these patients become long-term, disease-free survivors. Until it is possible clearly to predict those patients who do not respond and thereby to justify an approach other than thoracic irradiation, it is necessary to offer radiation therapy to all of these patients. Since local control is far from satisfactory, one can certainly justify investigating new approaches, including further increases of the total dose, altered fractionation schemes, addition of radiosensitizers, and high linear energy transfer radiations. Since distant metastases frequently appear in spite of thorough pretreatment evaluations, one can also justify investigating the addition of systemic agents, both cytotoxic drugs and biologic response modifiers. Benefit from these systemic approaches may be completely masked, even in patients with disseminated disease, by failure to prevent complications and death due to the intrathoracic tumor

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

[Review] [76 refs]	Clinical Trials as Topic, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Ions, Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Light, Physics, Planning Techniques, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	Disease outcome in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients is far from satisfactory. The main causes of failure remain linked to locoregional recurrences, which are due to incomplete eradication of clonogenic cells. Conventional radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy are currently carried out at their extreme possibilities due to their intrinsic limitation--namely the impossibility to generate concave dose distributions without compromising tumor irradiation. Approximately a third of patients treated with radiotherapy and most head and neck cancer cases present concave shapes of the target volumes. With the advent of intensity modulated radiation therapy--clinically available for only few years--head and neck patients can now benefit from strategies based on highly conformal techniques. It is possible to exploit efficiently dose-escalation protocols to increase probabilities to eradicate clonogens, to reduce overall treatment time, to control repopulation problems and to keep as low as reasonably necessary the irradiation of healthy tissues minimizing acute and late complications. Today, both planning and clinical studies demonstrate these advantages but larger controlled trials are necessary to assess the true potentialities of techniques based on intensity modulation for head and neck cancers. In a speculative view, proton therapy, possibly with intensity modulation, or light ion therapy should be considered for selected cases or for reirradiation due to their higher biological efficacy and their degree of dose-conformation to target volumes.

The proposed fractionation strategy consisted of a SIB treatment following a first phase of conventional fractionation to the elective volume (named SEQ/SIB). The novel method was compared to a conventional sequential fractionation and to a full SIB approach. Treatment plans were designed for five patients on the proton planning system developed for spot scanning at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Villigen (CH). Three to five beams were applied for all plans and fractionations. All effective dose distributions were corrected using biological models to take into account repopulation and time at repopulation onset. Corrected and uncorrected plans were compared on the basis of dosimetry criteria and dose-volume histograms. The results showed a dosimetric advantage for the SEQ/SIB approach in terms of target coverage, without significant disadvantages for risk structures and healthy tissue. Considering the high logistic impact and the limited availability of radiation facilities, the clinical exploitation of accelerated SIB treatment with protons appears promising

Twenty-three eyes have been enucleated because of complications and five eyes have been obtained at autopsy. We have evaluated 27 of these eyes. Neovascular glaucoma (10 eyes), painful keratitis (6 eyes), continued tumor growth (4 eyes), and vitreous hemorrhage (2 eyes) were the major complications of treatment that led to enucleation. The degree of tumor necrosis correlated with the size, pigmentation, and anterior extent of the tumor. It did not correlate with the interval from irradiation or with the amount of tumor shrinkage. Mitotic figures were extremely rare in treated tumors, suggesting that the tumor cells have lost their ability to cycle

A Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic system and a 6 MV linear accelerator have been modified for these treatments. By using multiple isocentric rotational fields, radiation doses from 1500 to 2500 cGy can be safely prescribed to the AVM in efforts to occlude the blood vessels without risking damage to nearby radiosensitive structures. Sixteen patients have been treated from February 1986 to July 1988 using the technique described

In the contrast representation 49 out of 66 patients showed a reduced enhancement after radiotherapy, an increase was observed in twelve patients. In 15 out of 22 cases, the irradiation was followed by a decrease of ventricle compression. In case of ventricular dilatation (n = 5), three decreases and two increases were observed. In case of displacement of the mid line (n = 15), eight decreases, five increases, and two identical results were found.

Since January 1991 we treated 3 retinoblastomas with proton beam at the cyclotron of Louvain-la-Neuve. Results are encouraging. The short term outcome seems comparable to phototherapy, but the long term expectancy is better, because of reduced secondary malignancies. Proton beam treatment for selected retinoblastomas seems a good alternative to external radiotherapy

Algorithms, Extremities, Head, Humans, Liver, Lung, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	Since the treatment of the first patient in 1994, the Peacock system has maintained its presence as the dominant method of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery. Currently in use at nearly 80 institutions, over 8000 patients have been treated using the system. Peacock treatments have been delivered to sites throughout the body, including CNS, head & neck, prostate, liver, kidney, lung, mediastinum, and extremities. IMRT, however, is a young and rapidly evolving treatment methodology. As institutions have explored new ways of improving radiation therapy with intensity-modulated techniques, the requirements for the Peacock system have also expanded. More sophisticated planning algorithms have been implemented to satisfy these new requirements, as well as better tools for treatment verification and quality assurance. In addition, new delivery techniques are being examined to improve the ability of IMRT to increase target volume doses while limiting organ-at-risk doses. One such technique, using helical tomotherapy (Peacock is an example of sequential tomotherapy), is currently being evaluated at one institution. Both techniques use narrow, modulated delivery beams. However, helical tomotherapy requires continuous movement of the couch during radiation, similar to helical CT. This work reviews the development of tomotherapy with the Peacock system. It then looks at current IMRT treatment techniques using tomotherapy, and how the field has broadened since the first treatments were delivered. Finally, it looks at the future of tomotherapy techniques, and how these techniques will adapt to the changing requirements for radiation therapy

OBJECTIVE: To present the surgical technique of total spondylectomy for a chordoma of the C5 vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Malignant bone tumors require wide resection. Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins. METHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: Total en bloc spondylectomy with wide surgical margins is feasible for malignant bone tumors of the cervical spine

The software, developed by MDS Nordion (presently Nucletron), is based on Kawrakow's VMC++ algorithm. The Monte Carlo module is integrated with our Theraplan Plustrade mark treatment planning system. An extensive commissioning process preceded clinical implementation of this software. Using a single virtual 'machine' for each electron beam energy, we can now calculate very accurately the dose distributions and the number of MU for any arbitrary field shape and SSD. This new treatment planning capability has significantly impacted our clinical practice. Since we are more confident of the actual dose delivered to a patient, we now calculate accurate three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions for a greater variety of techniques and anatomical sites than we have in the past. We use the Monte Carlo module to calculate dose for head and neck, breast, chest wall and abdominal treatments with electron beams applied either solo or in conjunction with photons. In some cases patient treatment decisions have been changed, as compared to how such patients would have been treated in the past. In this paper, we present the planning procedure and some clinical examples

When it was diagnosed, it measured 6mm in thickness and 11.9mm for the largest diameter and had a typical mushroom shape. General investigations found no metastatic disease. It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment. Neovascular glaucoma is a major complication that very often leads to enucleation	
1	2641	Evaluation of fixed- versus variable-modulation treatment modes for charged-particle irradiation of the gastrointestinal tract	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Biliary Tract Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Biophysics, California, Californium, Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Evaluation Studies as Topic, Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Ions, Kidney, Liver, Lung, Methods, Models,Structural, Neon, Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skull Base, Universities	The clinical usefulness of variable-modulation dose delivery of neon ion and proton beams over fixed-modulation beams is evaluated for several patients with tumors in the gastrointestinal tract by comparing dose distributions, dose volume histograms, and predictions of normal tissue complication probabilities calculated with the two methods. Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans	
1	2642	The effect of patient motion on dose uncertainty in charged particle irradiation for lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord	Biophysics, Brain, Brain Stem, California, Californium, Central Nervous System Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Ganglioneuroma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Ions, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uncertainty, Universities	A specialized charged-particle radiotherapy technique developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) is applied to patients with lesions abutting or surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. This technique divides the target into two parts, one partially surrounding the critical structure (brain stem or spinal cord) and a second excluding the critical structure and abutting the first portion of the target. Compensators are used to conform the dose distribution to the distal surface of the target. This technique represents a novel approach in treating unresectable or residual tumors surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. Since the placement of the patient with respect to beam-shaping devices is critical for divided-target treatments, a method for calculating dose distributions reflecting random patient motion is proposed, and the effects of random patient motion are studied for two divided-target patient examples. Dose-volume histograms and a normal-tissue complication probability model are used in this analysis. For the patients considered in this study, the normal-tissue-complication probability model predicts that random patient motion less than or equal to 0.2 cm is tolerable in terms of spinal cord complications

Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

High-resolution 3D T2-weighted fast spin echo (3D FSE) MRI scans were obtained for 60 consecutive ocular melanoma patients using a 1.5 T MRI (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), in a standard head coil. These patients were subsequently treated with proton beam therapy at the UC Davis Cyclotron, Davis, CA. The tumor was delineated by placement of tantalum rings (radio-opaque markers) around the tumor periphery as defined by pupillary transillumination during surgery. A point light source, placed against the sclera, was also used to confirm ring agreement with indirect ophthalmoscopy. When necessary, intraoperative ultrasound was also performed. The patients were planned using EYEPLAN software and the tumor volumes were obtained. For analysis, the tumors were divided into four categories based on tumor height and basal diameter. In order to assess the impact of high-resolution 3D T2 FSE MRI, the tumor volumes were outlined on the MRI scans by two independent observers and the tumor volumes calculated for each patient. Six (10%) of 60 patients had tumors, which were not visible on 3D MRI images. These six patients had tumors with tumor heights < or = 3 mm. A small intraobserver variation with a mean of (-0.22 +/- 4)% was seen in tumor volumes delineated by 3D T2 FSE MR images. The ratio of tumor volumes measured on MRI to EYEPLAN for the largest to the smallest tumor volumes varied between 0.993 and 1.02 for 54 patients. The tumor volumes measured directly on 3D T2 FSE MRI ranged from 4.03 to 0.075 cm3. with a mean of 0.87 +/- 0.84 cm3. The tumor shapes obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images were comparable to the tumor shapes obtained using EYEPLAN software. The demonstration of intraocular tumor volumes with the high-resolution 3D fast spin echo T2 weighted MRI is excellent and provides additional information on tumor shape. We found a high degree of accuracy for tumor volumes with direct MRI volumetric measurements in uveal melanoma patients. In some patients with extra large tumors, the tumor base and shape was modified, because of the additional information obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images	
1	2643	Anterior segment sparing to reduce charged particle radiotherapy complications in uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Anterior Eye Segment, California, Californium, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Helium, Helium/ae [Adverse Effects], Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation is to delineate the risk factors in the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) after helium-ion irradiation of uveal melanoma patients and to propose treatment technique that may reduce this risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

Radioimmunotherapy trials have so far been performed with beta-emitting isotopes. In contrast to beta-emitters, the shorter range and high linear energy transfer (LET) of alpha particles allow for more efficient and selective killing of individually targeted tumor cells. However, there are several obstacles to the use of alpha-particle immunotherapy, including problems with chelation chemistry and nontarget tissue toxicity. The alpha-emitting radioimmunoconjugate (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab is a new potential anti-lymphoma agent that might overcome some of these difficulties. The present study explores the immunoreactivity, in vivo stability and biodistribution, as well as the effect on in vitro cell growth, of this novel radioimmunoconjugate. To evaluate in vivo stability, uptake in balb/c mice of the alpha-particle-emitting nuclide (227)Th alone, the chelated form, (227)Th-p-nitrobenzyl-DOTA and the radioimmunoconjugate (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab was compared in a range of organs at increasing time points after injection. The immunoreactive fraction of (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab was 56-65%. During the 28 days after injection of radioimmunoconjugate only, very modest amounts of the (227)Th had detached from DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab, indicating a relevant stability in vivo. The half-life of (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab in blood was 7.4 days. Incubation of lymphoma cells with (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab resulted in a significant antigen-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The data presented here warrant further studies of (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab

Microscopic examination did not show any connection to the primary tumor. The different possibilities of pathogenesis (bloodborn metastasis to the same globe, episcleral metastasis by conjunctival lymphatics, surgical dissemination due to the suturing of tantalum marks around the primary tumor) are discussed. The ciliary melanoma has spread over the iris despite the irradiation, probably as a result of insufficient irradiation of its anterior border. The results of histologic examination of the partially necrotic, partially viable irradiated tumor are considered with regard to the conservative tumor therapy administered

Brain tumors of this type were not induced by protons of other energies (32-2,300 MeV). Induction of HGA has been identified in human patients who have had radiation therapy to the head. We believe that the induction of HGA in the monkey is a consequence of dose distribution, not some unique "toxic" property of protons. Comparison of the human experience with the monkey data indicates the RBE for induction of brain tumors to be about one. It is unlikely that protons cause an unusual change in oncogenic expression, as compared to conventional electromagnetic radiation

DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: All 1632 patients with choroidal melanoma treated at a single center between 1993 and 2002. INTERVENTION: Primary enucleation (35%), brachytherapy (31.3%), proton beam radiotherapy (16.7%), transscleral local resection (11.0%), endoresection (3.7%), transpupillary thermotherapy (2.5%), and photocoagulation (0.1%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary and secondary enucleation. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed the main predictive factors for primary enucleation to be: age more than 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-3.2%); reduced visual acuity (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.2%); posterior extension close to or involving the optic disc and fovea (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2%-2.4%); circumferential spread around the ciliary body, iris, or angle (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8%-5.5%); basal tumor diameter (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.4%-5.0%); and tumor height (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 4.5%-8.9%). After conservative treatment, the actuarial rate of secondary enucleation was 11.1% at 5 years (95% CI, 8.6%-13.6%). Cox multivariate analysis indicated the factors independently predicting secondary enucleation as: nasal/midline tumor location (risk ratio [RR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6%-4.4%); disc involvement (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2%-4.1%); tumor diameter (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.5%); and tumor thickness (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: With a multimodality approach to treatment, 65% of patients underwent conservative treatment, and of them, 89% retained their eye at 5 years, with success depending on tumor diameter, tumor thickness, disc involvement, and coronal location

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1993 and 2004, 88 patients with iris melanoma received proton beam radiotherapy, with 53.1 Gy in 4 fractions. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 52 years and a median follow-up of 2.7 years. The tumors had a median diameter of 4.3 mm, involving more than 2 clock hours of iris in 32% of patients and more than 2 hours of angle in 27%. The ciliary body was involved in 20%. Cataract was present in 13 patients before treatment and subsequently developed in another 18. Cataract had a 4-year rate of 63% and by Cox analysis was related to age (p = 0.05), initial visual loss (p < 0.0001), iris involvement (p < 0.0001), and tumor thickness (p < 0.0001). Glaucoma was present before treatment in 13 patients and developed after treatment in another 3. Three eyes were enucleated, all because of recurrence, which had an actuarial 4-year rate of 3.3% (95% CI 0-8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma is well tolerated, the main problems being radiation-cataract, which was treatable, and preexisting glaucoma, which in several patients was difficult to control

However, acute and chronic neurotoxicity has been described following HDMTX therapy, and the long-term intellectual outcome in children treated in this way is inadequately documented. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain is a noninvasive, quantitative way of assessing aspects of cerebral metabolism, which has not previously been applied to the study of children undergoing central nervous system directed therapy. PROCEDURE: To evaluate the potential role of (1)H-MRS in the investigation of related neurotoxicity, 11 children who had received HDMTX (cumulative dose 6-96 g/m(2)) underwent localised (1)H-MRS, magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropsychological assessments were performed on the children who had more than 1 year of follow-up time since last methotrexate treatment. Control (1)H-MRS studies on 11 adult and 6 young volunteers were undertaken. Eight patients had spectra of adequate quality. Comparisons between (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios and normal controls were made. RESULTS: Patients had a low choline/water ratio compared to controls (P < 0.01). No differences between patient and control NAA/water, Cr/water, Naa/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios were seen. Overall, 3 patients had abnormal white matter changes on MRI. The mean IQ of the patients (104.1) was in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that choline depletion in the brains of these patients may reflect subclinical disturbances of myelin metabolism as a result of methotrexate therapy and may represent a possible avenue of treatment in patients with clinical chronic methotrexate-related neurotoxicity.

Short-term effects at 2 months following treatment were studied in a further three patients. MRI abnormalities were observed in nine patients. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls (n = 17) were seen in any of the calculated 1H-MRS metabolite ratios, in any of the three patient groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis there was a correlation between the choline/water ratio and a low IQ. It is concluded that any systematic radiation-induced changes in the 1H MRS metabolites must be below the detection threshold of this study

The requirement for defining the relation of the optic nerves and chiasm to the intrasellar contents or suprasellar mass before proton beam irradiation or certain surgical approaches was satisfied. Pneumoencephalography as a supplemental procedure to CT and CT cisternography was replaced. The concomitant elimination of conventional sellar polytomography and pneumoencephalography results in decreased total radiation exposure and a more comfortable, expeditious workup

1	410	The effect of beam energy on the quality of IMRT plans for prostate conformal radiotherapy.[see comment]	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Neutrons, Photons, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Protons, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography Scanners,X-Ray Computed	Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) for prostate cancer is most commonly delivered with high-energy photons, typically in the range of 10-21 MV. With the advent of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), an increase in the number of monitor units (MU) relative to 3DCRT has lead to a concern about secondary malignancies. This risk becomes more relevant at higher photon energies where there is a greater neutron contribution. Subsequently, the majority of IMRT prostate treatments being delivered today are with 6-10 MV photons where neutron production is negligible. However, the absolute risk is small [Hall, E. J. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, Protons, and the Risk of Second Cancers. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 65, 1-7 (2006); Kry, F. S., Salehpour, M., Followill, D. S., Stovall, M., Kuban, D. A., White, R. A., and Rosen, I. I. The Calculated Risk of Fatal Secondary Malignancies From Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 62, 1195-1203 (2005).] and therefore it has been suggested that the use of an 18MV IMRT may achieve better target coverage and normal tissue sparing such that this benefit outweighs the risks. This paper investigates whether 18MV IMRT offer better target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Computed Tomography (CT) image sets of ten prostate cancer patients were acquired and two separate IMRT plans were created for each patient. One plan used 6 MV beams, and the other used 18 MV, both in a coplanar, non-opposed beam geometry. Beam arrangements and optimization constraints were the same for all plans. This work includes a comparison and discussion of the total integral dose, neutron dose conformity index, and total number of MU for plans generated with both energies	
0	2667	Execution of a single-isocenter three-field technique, using a multileaf collimator or tray-mounted cerrobend blocks: effect on treatment time	Axilla, Belgium, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Female, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Time, Time Factors, Universities	PURPOSE: In this article, we studied the total treatment time of a single-isocenter three-field irradiation of breast and axilla, using either tray-mounted cerrobend blocks, or a multileaf collimator (MLC) for field shaping. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 20 female, unselected patients were given 50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) on breast and 46 Gy on axilla and supraclavicular region (2 Gy/fraction). Patients were randomized between two different treatment groups. The first group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-75 linear accelerator (SL-75), using 5 MV photons with tray-mounted cerrobend blocks. The second group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-25 linear accelerator, using 6 MV photons and a MLC (SL-25-MLC). RESULTS: Although the beam-on time on the SL-25-MLC was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to the SL-75, overall treatment time was significantly shorter using a MLC instead of tray-mounted cerrobend blocks (p < 0.0001). The difference in total treatment time was in the range of 100 s per patient per day. The main difference between the two accelerators was observed when setup of the second and third field was done using the automatic setup facility of the SL-25-MLC (avoids entering the treatment room). A mean time gain of 124 s per treatment session was observed using automatic setup. Considering the yearly number of patients receiving this treatment, a total time gain equivalent to 16.15 8-h workdays was calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a technique using tray-mounted cerrobend blocks in the single-isocenter three-field irradiation of a breast and axilla, a MLC combined with automatic field setup provides a significant time advantage, by reducing the number of manipulations inside the treatment room	
0	2669	CO2 reactivity in arteriovenous malformations of the brain: a transcranial Doppler ultrasound study.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, California, Californium, Carbon, Carbon Dioxide/bl [Blood], Cerebral Arteries/pp [Physiopathology], Female, Hemodynamics, Humans, Hypocapnia/pp [Physiopathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/bl [Blood], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/us [Ultrasonography], Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Partial Pressure, Pressure, Radiation, Reference Values, Ultrasonography, Ultrasonography,Doppler,Transcranial, Universities	Arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) are congenital tangles of vessels that have a high blood flow through a low-resistance nidus. The vessels in the nidus may lack normal vasoreactivity in response to changes in PaCO2 or perfusion pressure (autoregulation). Arteriovenous malformation hemodynamics have been assessed based on the response of AVM feeding arteries to hypocapnia. Twenty-five AVM patients, aged 34 +/- 11 years (mean +/- standard deviation), were admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital for proton-beam radiation therapy. Fourteen healthy volunteers aged 30 +/- 7 years served as control subjects. Angiograms with calibrated markers permitting magnification correction were available for all patients. The limits of the middle cerebral artery, as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, were compared to measurements made on the angiograms. Hyperventilation was induced at a rate set by a metronome. Fixed bilateral Doppler probes allowed almost simultaneous sampling of two vessels. Volunteer control subjects were hyperventilated in two steps. The two PaCO2 step decreases were significant (mean resting PaCO2 40.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, Step 1 level 29.4 +/- 3.5 mm Hg and Step 2 level 23.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg; p < 0.01). These decreases induced a significant decrease in mean flow velocity (Vm) and an increase in the pulsatility index (p < 0.001). Mean carbon dioxide reactivity (% delta Vm/delta PaCO2) was 2.74 +/- 1.0 for Step 1 and 1.44 +/- 1.8 for Step 2 (p < 0.003). The mean PaCO2 decrease in patients was from 39.5 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 27.0 +/- 3.5 mm Hg. Carbon dioxide reactivity was 0.92 +/- 1.12 for feeding vessels and 2.59 +/- 1.78 for nonfeeding vessels (p < 0.001). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and angiographic depth measurements correlated well. Hyperventilation induced significantly more hemodynamic changes in control and nonfeeding middle cerebral arteries than in feeding vessels. Impaired CO2 reactivity may help to identify AVM feeding vessels as well as the relative magnitude of the flow provided to the malformation

These complex situations give rise to problems and inaccuracies in both dosimetry and analytical/empirical dose calculation, and therefore require other than conventional methods. A natural diamond detector and a Markus parallel plate ionization chamber have been selected for clinical dosimetry in 6 MV photon beams. Results of simulations using the Monte Carlo system BEAM/EGS4 to model the beam geometry have been compared with dose measurements. A modification of the existing component module for multileaf collimators (MLCs) allowed the modeling of a linear accelerator SL 25 (Elekta Oncology Systems) equipped with a MLC with curved leaf-ends. A mechanical measurement method with spacer plates and a light-field edge detection technique are described as methods to obtain geometrical data of collimator openings for application in the Monte Carlo system. Generally a good agreement is found between measurements and calculations of depth dose distributions and deviations are typically less than 1%. Calculated lateral dose profiles slightly exceed measured dose distributions near the higher level of the penumbras for a 10x2 cm2 field, but agree well with the measurements for all other cases. The simulations are also able to predict variations of output factors and ratios of output factors as a function of field width and field-offset. The Monte Carlo results demonstrate that qualitative changes in energy spectra are too small to explain these variations and that especially geometrical factors affect the output factors and depth dose curves and profiles

This retrospective study compares the results of treatment using hemibody irradiation (HBI) at the Royal Marsden Hospital (27 cases) with isotope therapy using the bone-seeking isotope strontium-89 (89Sr) at Southampton General Hospital (51 cases). Prior to analysis patients were matched for potential prognostic factors (performance status, bone scan extent of disease, age, histology and duration of hormone response) to minimize the effect of treatment selection bias. Pain control assessed at 3 months was similar for HBI and matched 89Sr cases, with 63% and 52% respectively showing some benefit. Median survival was similar for these groups at 20 and 21 weeks respectively. The unmatched 89Sr group, which had more favourable prognostic factors, had a better outcome with 96% showing improvement in pain and with a median survival of 59 weeks. Subsequent univariate analysis demonstrated that performance status and extent of disease on bone scan were of overriding importance in determining outcome. Transfusion requirements were higher for the HBI group than for the matched 89Sr group (50% and 25% respectively) but other bone marrow toxicity was similar. Despite routine anti-emetic therapy 37% of patients treated with HBI had some nausea or vomiting. Although expensive, 89Sr appears as effective a treatment option as HBI. Response is most likely with either approach when patients have a good performance status and a limited extent of disease. [References: 32]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1974 and 1995, 367 patients with chordomas (n = 195) and chondrosarcomas (n = 172) of the base of skull have been treated with combined megavoltage photon and 160 MeV proton radiotherapy. Following 3D treatment planning with delineation of target volumes and critical nontarget structures dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were calculated. Radiotherapy was given an 1.8 Gy or CGE (=Cobalt Gray Equivalent) dose per fraction, with prescribed target doses ranging from 63 CGE to 79.2 CGE (mean = 67.8 CGE). Doses to the brainstem surface were limited to < or = 64 CGE and to the brainstem center to < or = 53 CGE. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 6 months to 21.4 years (mean = 42.5 months). Brainstem toxicity was observed in 17 of 367 patients attributable to treatment, resulting in death of three patients. Actuarial rates of 5 and 10-year high-grade toxicity-free survival were 94 and 88%, respectively. Increased risk of brainstem toxicity was significantly associated with maximum dose to brainstem, volume of brainstem receiving > or = 50 CGE, > or = 55 CGE, and > or = 60 CGE, number of surgical procedures, and prevalence of diabetes or high blood pressure. Multivariate analysis identified three independent factors as important prognosticators: number of surgical procedures (p < 0.001), volume of the brainstem receiving 60 CGE (p < 0.001), and prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tolerance of brainstem to fractionated radiotherapy appears to be a steep function of tissue volume included in high dose regions rather than the maximum dose of brainstem alone. In addition, presence of predisposing factors as well as extent of surgical manipulation can significantly lower brainstem tolerance in the individual patient

METHODS: The head of the patient was immobilized by an individual cast mask. The target volume and adjacent critical structures were three-dimensionally segmented based on ophthalmological findings and MRI. The beam angles were optimized by a beam's eye view technique with a micro-multileaf collimator. We use a linear accelerator with 6-MeV photons. A patient was treated in a phase I/II trial with a single dose of 22.5 Gy. RESULTS: The accuracy of stereotactic positioning of the eye was 0.8 mm. The dose gradients were 15% mm. It was possible to spare the lens and the lacrimal gland in all cases. The treatment with four to six fields took 35-50 min and was tolerated without acute complications. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a new method to treat choroid metastases by stereotactic radiotherapy. This method allows to concentrate the dose to the target and to spare adjacent critical structures. One of the advantages of this noninvasive treatment is the short treatment time. The clinical role of this method has to be evaluated based on long-term results of tumor control and visual outcome in these patients

We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94%. One patient (2.2%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report 45 patients treated for chordoma or chondrosarcoma with postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy between 1990 and 1997. Patients had CT and MRI for 3D treatment planning performed under stereotactic guidance. Median dose at isocenter was 66.6 Gy for chordomas and 64.9 Gy for chondrosarcomas. MRI imaging was obtained in intervals after therapy to evaluate local relapse. Survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: All chondrosarcomas had achieved and maintained local control and recurrence-free status at follow-up of 5 years. Local control rate of chordomas was 82% at 2 years and 50% at 5 years. Survival was 97% at 2 years and 82% at 5 years. At maximum follow-up of 8 years local control and survival rate of chordomas was 40% (82%). Clinically significant late toxicity developed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of fractionated photon beam therapy and its success in the treatment of skull base tumors. Modern 3D treatment techniques provide superior results compared to conventional techniques. The role of high-precision radiotherapy compared to particle beam therapy in the treatment of these tumors is not yet fully clear and further research is needed

We have treated 54 patients with ciliary body melanoma using helium ions from 1978 to 1985. Because of the high rate of metastatic disease, the 5-year disease specific survival rate is only 59% despite a 5-year local control rate of 98%. The greatest diameter of the tumor was predictive of loss of vision and enucleation (p = .05, p = .04, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the greatest diameter of the tumor was the most important predictor of death from metastases. The incidence of neovascular glaucoma at 5 years is 43%. The 5-year actuarial rate of enucleation is 26%. Enucleation was done for pain and/or neovascular glaucoma. Univariate analysis showed treatment volume to be a statistically significant predictor for the development of neovascular glaucoma (p = .0017) and enucleation (p = .0078). Seventy percent of neovascular glaucoma occurred in patients with treatment volume greater than 5.5 cc. Seventy-four percent occurred in patients with an initial ultrasound height greater than 9.2 mm. Using this information, patients at high risk for neovascular glaucoma could be considered for prophylactic treatment with panretinal photocoagulation

1	1874	Refinement of the basic treatment equivalent model to reflect radiotherapy treatment throughput using Australasian data	Australia, Data Collection, Electrons, Female, Humans, Male, Models,Biological, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], New South Wales, New Zealand, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, Time	A model of radiotherapy linear accelerator throughput has been developed and shown to be a more sensitive measure of throughput than current measures of throughput. The present study aims to develop a more sensitive basic treatment equivalent (BTE) model that still measures linear accelerator throughput and considers some of the shortcomings of the previous model. All radiation oncology departments in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate. Departments were asked to time with a stopwatch all episodes of radiotherapy treatment over a 4-week period. Data collected for each treatment fraction included treatment intent, tumour site, patient age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, number of fields used, number of wedges used, number of junctions, number of shielding blocks used, whether the treatment was the first fraction, the use of general anaesthesia and whether port films or electronic portal imaging was used. Twenty-six departments of radiation oncology (70%) participated in this trial. A total of 7929 fractions of treatment, administered to 2424 patients, were timed. The factors found to most significantly impact on treatment duration on multivariate analysis were the type of fraction (first fraction was longer than subsequent fractions), type of beam (electrons were quicker than photons, which were quicker than mixed), number of fields, number of shields, number of junctions, number of port films and performance status (ECOG < 2 vs > 2). The age of the patient, number of compensators and the sex of the patient were not significant. The relationships between factors were assessed, and models of measuring linear accelerator throughput which consider complexity corrections were derived. It is possible to show that linear accelerator throughput is poorly measured by just considering numbers of patients or fields treated per unit time; and that other factors that impact on treatment duration must be considered. A more sensitive model of patient throughput is suggested; but even when a large number of factors are considered, some insensitivity still remains in the model	
1	2684	Basic Treatment Equivalent (BTE): a new measure of linear accelerator workload	Australia, Efficiency, Hospital Departments/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization], Time, Workload	The measurement of linear accelerator workload in radiation oncology departments is usually based on the number of fields treated per unit time. However, this approach ignores variations in treatment complexity. This prospective study, was designed to measure treatment workload directly, taking into account the variations in complexity of different treatment techniques. From this, a model was to be developed, which would be simple to apply and reproducible, both within and between radiation oncology departments in Australasia. It would provide a realistic basis for assessing treatment costs and enable the comparison of patient throughput between departments. This paper describes the derivation of the model. Over a 4-week period in the Radiation Oncology Department of Westmead Hospital, all fractions of radiotherapy were timed. The data collected included: tumour site; treatment intent; number of fields; number of wedges, compensators and shielding blocks; fraction number; patient age; performance status; and need for general anaesthesia. Multivariate modelling was performed to identify factors that significantly affected fraction duration, so that these could be used to develop a model of resource utilization. The durations of 2371 fractions were measured in 219 patients. Seventy-five per cent of fractions were given with radical intent. The factors found to influence fraction duration on multivariate modelling were: number of fields; number of shielding blocks; first treatment fraction; need for anaesthesia; and performance status. The number of wedges and compensators were also found to be significant but were not included in the model in order to maintain simplicity. This was felt to be necessary if the model is to be applied to the widest possible variety of machines. A model of resources utilization called 'Basic Treatment Equivalent' (BTE) was derived, which incorporated these factors. When tested at Westmead Hospital, this model accurately reflected the predicted BTE value over a further 1-week study period. This model of linear accelerator use, which incorporates complexity has been derived and evaluated in one radiation oncology department. This requires further prospective testing before its widespread use. The model appears to reflect linear accelerator workload better than previous measures. An Australasian study to validate the model further will be undertaken. If adopted, this model has implications for comparative workload reports, diagnostic-related groups, waiting list calculations, and patient scheduling	
1	826	Radiotherapy for local control of osteosarcoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Bone Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Bone Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Child, Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Osteosarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Osteosarcoma/su [Surgery], Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Local control of osteosarcoma in patients for whom a resection with satisfactory margins is not achieved can be difficult. This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05). No definitive dose-response relationship for local control of tumor was seen, although the local control rate was 71% +/- 9% for 32 patients receiving doses > or =55 Gy vs. 53.6% +/- 20.1% for 9 patients receiving <55 Gy (p = 0.11). Of 15 patients with tumors >5.3 cm, 9 received doses > or =55 Gy and the local control rate was 80% +/- 17.9%, and 6 received doses <55 Gy with a local control rate of only 50% +/- 25% at 5 years (p = 0.16). Among patients who underwent gross total resection, the local control rate was 77.5% +/- 9.95% in 22 patients with negative margins vs 66.7% +/- 27.2% in 3 patients with positive margins (p = 0.54). Two patients had unknown margin status. CONCLUSION: RT can help provide local control of osteosarcoma for patients in whom surgical resection with widely, negative margins is not possible. It appears to be more effective in situations in which microscopic or minimal residual disease is being treated

METHODS: The authors review the current status of advanced technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. RESULTS: Advances in radiotherapy have resulted in improved treatment for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses modifications in the intensity of the photon-beam from a linear accelerator across the irradiated fields to enhance dose conformation in three dimensions. For proton-beam radiation therapy, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are accelerated in cyclotrons or synchrotrons, extracted, and transported to treatment rooms where the proton beam undergoes a series of modifications that conform the dose in a particular patient to the tumor target. Brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy have generally been used to treat microscopic residual disease in patients with sarcomas. These technologies deliver dose to tumor cells with irradiation of limited volumes of normal tissue. Patients who may benefit from technically advanced radiotherapy include those with skull base and spine/paraspinal sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and retroperitoneal/extremity sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in radiation therapy technology, particularly IMRT, proton-beam or other charged-particle radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and intraoperative radiation therapy, have led to improved treatment for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable

This report describes a technique for stereotactic treatment of small lesions using conventional, fractionated, photon beam irradiation. The Laitinen's stereoadapter, non-invasive head frame was used. This device was tested for accuracy by serial mountings and found to be accurate within 1 mm. The accuracy of the dose delivered was within 2%. Adaptation of this device to the linear accelerator required the design of secondary circular collimators which decreased the penumbra from 3-4 mm to 2-3 mm. The dose fall off outside the target volume is steep enough when using two non-coplanar arcs (90 to 10% within 1 cm). Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) in a humanoid phantom showed good correlation with the calculated dose. This system permits delivery of fractionated radiation therapy to small volumes, easily and accurately, under stereotactic conditions

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications

Group A was treated with conventional dose/fraction (180-200 cGy) X 5 days/week and Group B was treated with 250 cGy/fraction X 4 days/week. Total dose was reduced by 10% in Group B patients to allow comparison of biologically equivalent doses. Two categories of patients were analyzed in each group: patients receiving planned high dose preoperative radiation (4000-4500 cGy); and patients receiving high dose radiation for post-surgical recurrent tumors or locally advanced inoperable tumors (5500-6000 cGy). Tumor regression was markedly better in patients treated with the 250 cGy/fraction. Overall response (greater than 50% regression) was 35% (10/29) in Group A and 62% (18/29) in Group B. Nine of 10 patients in Group B, treated preoperatively, had greater than 50% regression in tumor size, with two patients having no evidence of disease on surgico-pathological evaluation. Six of 10 similar patients in Group A had greater than 50% tumor regression

The treatment of these tumors at Curie Institute has been done with cobalt plaques since 1968. Indications were first monophthalmic patients but are now much wide. We have been treating since 1981 all patients with tumor diameter less than 17 mm and tumor height less than 12 mm. The technic includes general anesthesia to place the disc with localisation of the tumor by transillumination or by indirect ophthalmoscopy. A dose of 70 to 90 grays is delivered to the apex of the tumor. We report two cases of patients treated by cobalt 60 plaque for choroidal melanoma. The first patient has a 5 mm high choroidal melanoma temporal to the macula. After treatment by cobalt plaque, he showed no echographic changes but angiograms revealed an hypofluorescent zone in the central part of the tumor. The second patient has an 8 mm tumor that after plaque showed only angiographic changes. Evolution after treatment of choroidal melanoma by radioactive plaque is variable. Echographic changes are very low and it is frequent to observe no modification in the height of the tumor for a long time for this reason, repeated angiograms can be very useful in the follow up of these patients. They frequently show hypofluorescent spot in the central part of a tumor that was hyperfluorescent before treatment. Sometimes there is diffuse lowering of the fluorescence. We think that these modifications of fluorescence can be due to diminution of the vascularisation of the tumor or may be to central necrosis of the tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1991 and September 1995, 612 patients presenting with choroidal melanoma were treated by protontherapy in Orsay. Following initial management of the first 464 patients, results were analyzed, as were results after a 1-year follow-up for 305 patients, a 2-year follow-up for 169 patients, and a 3-year follow-up for 59 patients. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the actuarial local recurrence rate was 5%, the 3-year survival rate 88%, and the overall metastasic rate 5%. The initial tumor volume was the most significant predictive factor for visual results and metastases. Multivariate analysis revealed that visual results were significantly related to the initial tumor volume, initial retinal detachment, and total dose delivered to the optic nerve and macula. CONCLUSION: Protontherapy of choroidal melanoma allows in most cases conservation of the eye without modification of survival. Visual results mainly depend on the site and size of the tumor

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Iodine 125 plaques were used to treat all uveal melanomas between the end of 1989 and 1991. Since 1991, we have used iodine plaques for small anterior tumors and proton beam for other tumors. We use a plaque with a larger diameter than the tumor diameter (2-4mm) with a dose of 90Gy at the apex. Proton beam therapy is used for all tumors at the equator or posterior to the equator not thicker than 12mm. The dose given is 60Gy cobalt equivalent in four fractions. For each patient, the initial size and location of the tumor were noted as well as the follow-up each year: the outcome for the eye (local recurrence, ocular conservation, and functional results), the occurrence of metastasis, and survival. A statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between December 1989 and September 1998, 1272 patients were treated: 926 (72.8%) were treated with proton beam irradiation and 346 (27.8%) with iodine 125 plaques. The median follow-up was 5 years (60 months). For the patients treated with proton beam therapy, the mean age was 58 years, the tumor location was anterior to the equator for 3.8%, at the equator for 43.6%, and posterior to the equator for 52.6%. The mean tumor diameter was 13.4mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.69mm. For the patients treated with iodine 125 plaques, the mean age was 61.5 years. The location of the tumor was anterior to the equator for 34.4%, at the equator for 46.5%, and posterior to the equator for 19.1%. The mean tumor diameter was 11.5mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.12mm. The recurrence rate was 4% for the proton beam treatment and 3.75% for iodine plaques. There was no statistical difference. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the rate of local recurrence is usually higher with iodine 125 plaques than proton beam therapy. We discuss the risk factors for local recurrence after iodine 125 plaques: tumor diameter, lower dose to the tumor apex and lower dose rate, and posterior location of the tumor. We found a higher mortality rate in patients who presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: When we use iodine 125 plaques for anterior tumors with the proper dose and dose rate to the apex of the tumor, we do not find more recurrence than with proton beam therapy

We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy.

[French]	Biopsy, Brachytherapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: We conducted a retrospective study on the clinical factors influencing the local and general prognosis of patients treated for uveal melanoma with a preliminary analysis of the prognostic value of monosomy 3. PATIENTS: and method: The patients sent to Curie Institute for uveal melanoma have a complete initial clinical evaluation, conservative management by radiotherapy or enucleation, and local and general long-term follow-up. Over the last 5 years, the status of chromosome 3 has been assessed by FISH in the tumors of enucleated patients. Findings concerning the initial workup, treatment, and follow-up are recorded prospectively. We conducted a retrospective study with multivariate analysis of the clinical factors influencing local recurrence, ocular conservation metastasis, and survival and studied the effect of monosomy 3. RESULTS: A total of 2241 patients were registered with a median follow-up of 72 months. Of these patients, 92.8% had conservative management with iodine 125 brachytherapy or proton beam therapy and 7.2% of the patients had enucleation (n=160). Tumors from 120 patients were studied for the status of chromosome 3 by FISH. The overall survival rate was 76.3% and the metastatic rate was 19.5%. The clinical factors influencing survival were the size and location of the tumor, age of the patient, gender, and initial treatment. The factors influencing the metastatic risk were the same plus retinal detachment and local recurrence. Monosomy 3 was a significant risk factor for metastatic disease. DISCUSSION: This study found the usual risk factors with the difference that location on the equator seems to be of worse prognosis than ciliary body involvement for survival and metastasis. In addition, the initial retinal detachment appears to be a risk factor for local recurrence and metastasis. At present, the evaluation of chromosome 3 is available for enucleated tumors but it could probably be done on needle biopsy performed during conservative management as well. CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous results on the prognostic factors of uveal melanoma and on the value of monosomy 3. The increasingly precise identification of a group of high-risk patients should allow us to propose adjuvant therapy and to adapt follow-up

Patients were followed for eighteen to forty-five months with regard to progression of disease and development of long-term complications. Upstaging to Stage D1 by virtue of discovering pelvic node involvement was noted in 16 patients (53.3 per cent). Subsequent disease progression (defined as development of bone or soft tissue metastasis) was seen in 9 of 16 upstaged patients with an average time to progression of 12.2 months. Three Stage D1 patients have died with an average time to death of 19.6 months. Only 1 patient whose lymphadenectomy was negative has experienced disease progression, and none has died. Adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride) was given to 9 upstaged patients, in only 3 did disease progress. In contrast, in 6 of 7 upstaged patients not receiving chemotherapy metastatic disease developed, with an average time to progression of 10.3 months. In an attempt to improve local tumor control achieved by interstitial irradiation alone, 18 patients received additional external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, in doses ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 rad. There were sixteen long-term complications in the 30 patients, 75 per cent of which were seen in patients receiving added external beam irradiation

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

Although they do not usually show cytological atypia, metastases have been reported in 30 per cent of cases. Survival rates in cases of skull base locations are low, and local recurrence is common after local excision. Radiation therapy is used in post-operative treatment and proton radiation therapy as the primary treatment. In the present paper we present the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian man affected by chordoma of the clivus, with liver and chest metastases, relapsed after several surgical local excisions, to discuss improvements in therapeutic and imaging techniques. Indium111 (In111) pentetreotide single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed to assess the presence of somatostatin receptors and to treat the tumour with radiolabelled Y90-DOTA-lanreotide. Imaging, performed 2 months afterwards, showed stable disease in the lungs but a local progression in the metastases, in comparison with pre-treatment uptake. These data suggest the usefulness of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues in the diagnosis and therapy of chordomas

Accurate patient positioning is mandatory because of the steep dose gradients outside the tumour volume. Owing to the increased complexity of the treatment planning and delivery techniques, verification of the dose delivery before and during the actual patient treatment is equally important. For this purpose, a quality assurance programme has been established in our clinic that is primarily based on measurements with electronic portal imaging devices. To minimise systematic set-up errors, the patient positioning is measured in the first few treatment fractions and a set-up correction is applied in the subsequent ones. Before the first treatment fraction, portal dose measurements are performed for each treatment field with the electronic portal imaging device to verify that the planned fluence distribution is correctly delivered at the treatment unit. Dosimetric measurements are also performed during patient treatment to derive the actually delivered fluence maps. By combining this information with knowledge on the patient set-up, the delivered 3-D dose distribution to both the tumour and sensitive organs may be assessed. However, for the highest accuracy, exact knowledge on the (internal) patient geometry during treatment, e.g. using a cone-beam CT, is required

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

All patients referred to radiotherapy were treated by electron beam (10-15 MeV) and followed for more than 5 years. Postoperative radiotherapy after radical operation, with no macroscopic disease, was performed in 18 patients, 7 of whom were treated by radical re-operation and radiation of a recurrent parotid neoplasm. In these groups, the local recurrence rate was 4/18 (22%) and 2/7 (29%), the 5-year survival rate was 9/18 (50%) and 5/7 (71%). In 17 patients, radiotherapy started with gross tumor left behind. This group showed a local recurrence rate of 10/17 (59%) and a 5-year survival of 7/17 (41%). Treatment was well tolerated with no major sequelae. Local tumor control and its impact on survival is discussed

In other words, about 10% of patients still fail to respond to the therapy. This probably means nothing but the fact that the sigmoid response curve has reached the plateau. This ratio has remained unchanged, while physical and biological dose distribution has remarkably been improved these three decades. In this study, therefore, we discussed the cause of radioresistance in squamous metaplasia of laryngeal epithelium as the origin of laryngeal cancer

However, the preferred assessment following radiation therapy is local control. PROCEDURE: A review of large group experiences over the past several decades was undertaken to assess the optimal radiation dose and volume for patients with localized, osseous Ewing sarcoma. New approaches and techniques to improve local control were also investigated. RESULTS: With multidisciplinary therapy, 5-year overall local control rates range from 58 to 93%. Following definitive irradiation, they are 53-86%. Recommended radiation therapy doses are 55.8-60.0 Gy. In the postoperative setting, gross disease requires 55.8 Gy; microscopic disease requires 45 Gy. Altered fractionation schemes have not improved local control. The appropriate irradiated volume is an involved field to the pretreatment tumor volume plus 2.0-2.5 cm margin, followed by a boost to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume with margin. Good radiation quality control with central review improves local control. Use of an involved radiation field requires accuracy in defining tumor volume. Techniques to improve local control include risk-adapted multidisciplinary therapy, intraoperative boost radiation, and high radiation doses as delivered by 3-dimensional conformal radiation. Intensity modulated and proton beam radiotherapy may offer an advantage at special sites. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative uses of radiation in the multidisciplinary setting will continue to provide excellent local control, improved function, and quality of life for young patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone.

Patient tolerance has been excellent, many preferring it to mirror examination. I personally prefer the added length of the bronchoscope to the shorter nasopharyngoscope, allowing me not to be so close to the patient and also allowing me to let them see their own larynx and be reassured. The suction channel on the bronchoscope is a great advantage compared with the nasopharyngoscope. Video link-up is easily organized. Finally, as most District General Hospitals possess a fibrebronchoscope, it is something that can be organized with minimal or no cost

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients having adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands were treated with fast neutron radiotherapy during the years 1985-1994. All patients had either unresectable disease or gross disease remaining after attempted surgical extirpation. Seventeen patients had previously received conventional radiotherapy and their subsequent treatment fields and doses for neutron radiotherapy were modified for critical sites (brainstem, spinal cord, brain). Although the median doses (tumor maximum and tumor minimum) only varied by < or = 10%, treatment portals were substantially smaller in these patients because of normal tissue complication considerations. Twelve patients (13%) had distant metastases at the time of treatment and were only treated palliatively with smaller treatment portals and lower median tumor doses (< or = 80% of the doses delivered to curatively treated patients). Seventy-two patients were treated with curative intent, with nine of these having recurrent tumors after prior full-dose radiotherapy. The median duration of follow-up at the time of analysis was 31.5 months (range 3-115). Sites of disease and number of patients treated per disease site were as follows: paranasal sinus-31; oral cavity-20; oropharynx-12; nasopharynx-11; trachea-6; and other sites in the head and neck-4. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial local-regional tumor control rate for all patients treated with curative intent was 47%. Patients without involvement of the cavernous sinus, base of skull, or nasopharynx (51 patients) had a 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate of 59%, whereas local-regional control was significantly lower (15%) for patients with tumors involving these sites (p < 0.005). In the latter cases, normal tissue injury considerations precluded delivery of the full dose to the entire tumor. Patients with no history of prior radiotherapy (63 patients) had an actuarial local control rate of 57% at 5 years compared to 18% for those (9 patients) who had been previously irradiated with conventional photons (p = 0.018). Eliminating the dose-limiting factors of prior radiation therapy and/or high risk sites of involvement, the 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate for these 46 patients was 63%, with an actuarial cause specific survival rate of 79%. Lymph node status was a predictor of distant metastasis: 57% of node positive patients developed distant metastases by 5 years compared to 15% of patients with negative nodes (p < 0.0005), and patients who had nodal involvement developed distant metastases sooner than node negative patients (p < 0.0001). The 5-year actuarial overall survival and cause specific survival for the 72 patients treated with curative intent were 59% and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fast neutron radiotherapy offers high local-regional control and survival rates for patients with locally advanced, unresectable adenoid cystic carcinomas of minor salivary glands. It should be considered as initial primary treatment for these patients, as well as for other patients in whom surgical extirpation would cause considerable morbidity	
1	1607	Neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands	Adenocarcinoma, Adenoma,Pleomorphic/rt [Radiotherapy], Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cyclotrons, Humans, Liver, Lung, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Survivors, Time	INTRODUCTION: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common neoplasm arising in the salivary glands. Surgical management is the primary therapeutic modality. With the use of modern surgical techniques, recurrence is infrequent, and facial nerve sparing is the norm. However, for patients with recurrent disease, the risk of further relapses is increased with surgical resection alone, particularly for those patients in whom multiple recurrences have already occurred. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting remains uncertain. Although neutron radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy for malignant salivary gland tumors, its role in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas is less well defined. We report our experience using this modality for high-risk, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. METHODS: Sixteen patients were treated with neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands from 1986 through 1993. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11-77 years); median age at the time of neutron radiotherapy was 52 years (range, 22-77 years); median number of prior surgical procedures was 3 (range, 1-6); median duration from initial diagnosis to radiotherapy was 14.5 years (range, 3 months-30 years); median follow-up was 83 months (range, 9-144 months). The median period at risk for survivors was 96 months (defined as the interval from completion of neutron radiotherapy to last follow-up). Ten patients had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment as determined by imaging studies, with nine patients having multinodular disease. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial survival was 79%. One patient died from lung metastases 9 months after treatment; one patient died from a liver tumor of uncertain origin, but the histology could not rule out a metastasis from the previous pleomorphic adenoma; and one patient died from recurrent disease at the base of skull. The 15-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 85%. One of the two patients with locoregional recurrence had a malignant transformation into an adenocarcinoma. No statistical difference in 15-year actuarial survival (75% vs 83%, p =.82) was found comparing patients with gross residual disease vs microscopic residual disease. The actuarial 15-year locoregional control was 76% for patients with gross residual disease vs 100% for those with microscopic disease. The 15-year actuarial risk of RTOG/ESTRO nonaudiologic grade III/IV complications was 21%. No facial nerve injuries were observed as a direct consequence of neutron radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron radiotherapy offers both excellent local control rates and survival rates in patients with multiply recurrent pleomorphic adenomas that are not candidates for surgical resection, even in the presence of gross residual disease. The treatment-related morbidity is acceptable. Malignant transformations and metastases, although uncommon, may be observed in this tumor. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc	
1	2721	Dosimetric results from a feasibility study of a novel radiosurgical source for irradiation of intracranial metastases	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Electric Power Supplies, Equipment Design, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Self Care, Survival, Time, X-Rays	PURPOSE: A feasibility study addressing the role of a new miniature x-ray device, the Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS), for interstitial radiosurgical treatment of intracranial metastatic neoplasms, was conducted at our institution. To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

We described in this study the first case of petrousal bone apex chondroblastoma. METHODS: The tumor occurred in a 12-year-old girl and was revealed by left hypoacusis, vertigo, and walking instability. Computerized tomography scan depicted well-demarcated and osteolytic lesion of the left petrousal bone just before the internal acoustic meatus. The tumor was operated on by a subtemporal approach with a subtotal resection. Lesion recurred and was operated a second time by a combined approach subtemporal and translabyrinthine. This treatment was completed by radiotherapy. We used a combination of photon therapy and proton therapy. Outcome was good and free of recurrence 36 months after the second operation. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy can be particularly useful for skull base tumors frequently radioresistant and near very important structures.

Fourteen days to three months after the proton irradiation, intensified irritation of the diencephalic structures was recorded. Later on, gradual normalization of bioelectrical activity was observed. Local changes in the temporal lobes, probably associated with the tissue response to irradiation by the proton beam were noted only in 8 out of the 60 patients

Since November 1987, 26 patients with resectable gastric cancer were irradiated intraoperatively with the linear accelerator using fast electrons (single dose: 12 to 16 Gy). Percutaneous radiotherapy was performed postoperatively with 24 to 38 Gy (4 x 2 Gy per week). For intraoperative and percutaneous radiotherapy the target absorbed dose was selected in a way that their combined effect on the tumor was approximately equivalent to that of a total dose of 60 Gy in the usual fractionating. Up to now, the median survival time for stage III patients (UICC 1987) has been twelve months. In five patients who died of a relapse or of peritoneal carcinosis, histologic evaluation revealed in every case a diffuse tumor type according to Lauren-classification. All relapses occurred within the first eight months. The two-year survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier is 67% for stage III. Advanced resectable gastric cancer of the intestinal tumor type seems to profit from adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy. The results warrant further research within the framework of a prospective randomized multicenter study

One hundred and sixty-eight patients were recruited between 1977 and 1984. The minimum follow-up is 2 years. Three patients were withdrawn before treatment began. Eighty-five were allocated to neutron therapy and 80 to receive photon therapy. All patients had squamous cell cancers in one of four primary sites: oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. Local tumor control was similar in both groups: 44.7% after neutrons and 45.0% after photons. Salvage surgery was performed on 18 patients in each treatment group for residual or recurrent cancer. Acute radiation reactions of the mucous membranes were significantly more severe after photons. The number of patients with serious late reactions was greater after neutron therapy but the difference was not statistically significant. There were six deaths related to late morbidity after neutron therapy but none after photon therapy. Survival was better after photon therapy but the difference compared with the neutron group failed to reach statistical significance. When intercurrent deaths are excluded, the difference is less marked. Photon therapy was clearly better in terms of disease-free survival giving a 2-year local disease-free rate of 41.3% (s.e. 5.5%) compared with 29.4% (s.e. 4.9%) after neutrons

[French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Argon, Brachytherapy, Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Hemangioma/su [Surgery], Humans, Laser Coagulation, Male, Middle Aged, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Therapeutic retrospective results obtained after Argon laser photocoagulation of 17 circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas associated with serous retinal detachment were analyzed. All patients were symptomatic but one. Duration of visual symptoms varied from 2 weeks to 3 years. Mean tumor thickness was 3,3mm (1 to 6,5mm). Mean tumor diameter was 6,5mm (2.5 to 15mm). Tumors were juxtapapillary in 9 cases (57%). The mean distance from the fovea was 1,5mm (0 to 3mm), and the fovea was pathological in all cases but two. The tumoral surface was covered by Argon laser spots with the central avascular area spared in the case of subfoveal hemangioma. In the case of subretinal fluid persistence 3 months later, 1 or more photocoagulation sessions were carried out. Follow-up was 27 months (6 to 156 months). RESULTS: Success (complete subretinal fluid resolution) was obtained in 82.4% with 1 or 2 laser photocoagulation sessions. Recurrence was observed in 4 cases (23.5%) but treated with success. Final visual acuity, related to the initial foveal condition, was >=0.5 in 23.5% of cases, and >=0.1 in 70.6% of cases. DISCUSSION: Anatomical and functional results were satisfactory considering initial foveal conditions. Irradiation (external beam irradiation, proton beam therapy, brachytherapy) has been used with success for several years. However, radiation-induced damage was described in addition to a few practical disadvantages. CONCLUSION: Argon laser photocoagulation was an effective noninvasive therapy for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. It remains for us the reference method for treating this tumor

Patients with cervix or esophageal cancer were treated with 10 MV X-rays produced at a LINAC accelerator, or high-energy carbon ions produced at the HIMAC accelerator at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba. Blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the radiation treatment. Chromosomes were prematurely condensed by incubation in calyculin A. Aberrations in chromosomes 2 and 4 were scored after fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole-chromosome probes. Pre-treatment samples were exposed in vitro to X-rays, individual dose-response curves for the induction of chromosomal aberrations were determined, and used as calibration curves to calculate the effective whole-body dose absorbed during the treatment. This calculated dose, based on the calibration curve relative to the induction of reciprocal exchanges, has a sharp increase after the first few fractions of the treatment, then saturates at high doses. Although carbon ions are 2-3 times more effective than X-rays in tumor sterilization, the effective dose was similar to that of X-ray treatment. However, the frequency of complex-type chromosomal exchanges was much higher for patients treated with carbon ions than X-ray

One hundred and sixteen patients were treated with conventional pelvic megavoltage x-ray therapy. Sixty-four patients were treated with combined pelvic x-ray therapy plus a perineal proton beam boost to a carefully defined prostatic tumor volume. A 160 MeV proton beam has been modified to irradiate patients with localized tumors by using conventional treatment schedules. This proton beam has the physical advantage over megavoltage x-rays of reducing the dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. By using the proton beam boost we have delivered an increased prostatic tumor dose of 500 to 700 cGy without increasing treatment morbidity at all. The two groups are actuarially analyzed for patient survival, disease-free survival and local recurrence-free survival, and thus far, no significant differences have been noted. Because of the minimal complications observed in the proton group despite a 10% increase in dose, a randomized clinical trial comparing these two treatment techniques is studied

As of 9/92 a total of 28 patients suffering from peripheral (n = 20) or centrally (n = 8) located soft tissue sarcomas had been were treated. Thirteen patients revealed a primary and 15 patients a recurrent tumor. Tumor resection with negative margins was performed in 20 patients, positive margins remained in 5 patients, and gross macroscopic residual disease in 3 patients. Combined intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy was applied in 22 patients, using IORT doses of 10-20 Gy and an external beam dose of 26-50 Gy. Three patients were irradiated intraoperatively twice with a time interval of 24 h. After a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 20 patients are disease free. Two patients died 4 and 5 months after the end of therapy with rapidly progressive distant metastases. An infield failure within the external beam target volume was seen in 1 patient and local failure at the field margin of the external field in 3 patients. So far, there have been no IORT infield failures. Follow-up is performed with magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 patients a second operation was necessary because of a severe wound infection, including one patient suffering from osteomyelitis of a neighboring bone. Mild sensory neuropathy occurred in 1 patient 7 months after treatment. Overall only mild and reversible postoperative and posttherapeutic complications were seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	
1	2750	The risk of enucleation after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma	Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Retinal Detachment/et [Etiology], Risk, Risk Factors, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision	Enucleation after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas occurred in 64 (6.4%) of 994 eyes with a median follow-up time of 2.7 years. The median time between irradiation and enucleation in the 64 enucleated eyes was 13 months. The probability of retaining the eye was 95 and 90%, 2 and 5 years postirradiation, respectively. Three percent of eyes were enucleated during posttreatment year 1, and the yearly rate was 1% by the fourth year. No patient had enucleation later than 5 1/2 years posttreatment. The complication most likely to result in enucleation was neovascular glaucoma although this was frequently managed without enucleation. Other common reasons for enucleation were documented or suspected tumor growth and complete retinal detachment with associated loss of vision. The leading risk factors for enucleation were anterior tumor margin involving the ciliary body, tumor height greater than 8 mm, and proximity of the tumor to the fovea. Based on the presence or absence of these factors, 5-year eye retention rates were 99, 92, and 76% for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Thus, the probability of eye retention after proton beam irradiation is high even among those at greatest risk of enucleation

The authors followed 946 patients with melanomas of the choroid and/or ciliary body who had been treated with proton beam irradiation and who had provided a smoking history during their evaluation before treatment. After a mean follow-up of 33 months, 98 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease. Metastasis-free survival rates 3 years after irradiation were similar in association with never, past, and current cigarette smoking (86%, 89%, and 90%, respectively; P = 0.90). Rates also were similar with increasing pack-years of exposure and when the product smoked was cigarettes versus pipes or cigars only. Estimates for smoking effects were unchanged after adjusting for established prognostic factors for metastases. Results suggest that smoking does not alter the risk of metastases during the first few years after irradiation of choroidal melanomas

METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an extension of the Cox model, we based our analysis on a cohort of 1541 consecutive patients with unilateral choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated with protons (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 to 7 fractions) at the Harvard University (Boston, Mass) cyclotron between July 1, 1975, through December 31, 1993, and who were observed prospectively up to September 30, 1995. Patient survival and the status of the treated eye were updated annually. RESULTS: By September 1995 (median follow-up among survivors, 8 years), 137 patients underwent enucleation after radiotherapy for complications (n=103) or tumor regrowth (n=34). The overall 10-year rate of eye retention was 89% (95% confidence interval, 87%-91%). Of the 1541 patients, 300 died of tumor metastasis, 38 following enucleation of the affected eye (mean interval from enucleation to death, 25 months). The multivariate rate ratio for metastatic death associated with enucleation (modeled as a time-dependent covariate) was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4) for enucleation due to complications and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-6.3) for enucleation associated with tumor regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of tumor viability, enucleation after primary irradiation for choroidal melanoma has no deleterious effect on patients' survival. Enucleation concurrent with tumor regrowth is associated with high death rates; growth of the tumor in the eye may presage systemic recurrence and death from metastasis

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether childbearing may be a favorable prognostic factor in melanoma of the uveal tract. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SETTING: Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death from metastatic choroidal melanoma. METHODS: We evaluated a consecutive series of 1818 patients with choroidal melanoma, 748 parous and 165 nulliparous women and 905 men, after treatment with proton irradiation. Three hundred fifty-two deaths from metastasis were documented in follow-up. RESULTS: Overall multivariate-adjusted death rates from metastasis were approximately 25% higher in nulliparous women (relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.82) and men (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00-1.56) than in women who had given birth. The protective influence of parity was strongest in the early period following diagnosis and treatment (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.88-2.86, and RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.04-2.19, in nulliparous women and men, respectively, during the first 36 months of follow-up). The level of protection increased with the number of live births (P for trend, .04). CONCLUSION: These data provide support for the hypothesis that a history of childbearing confers protection from death in choroidal melanoma

It identifies the risk factors for local tumor-control failure and for ocular tumor-related death. It presents the improvements implemented to increase the rate of local tumor control, and compares the survival rate of patients with locally controlled tumors to those of patients who had to receive a second treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated 2,435 uveal melanomas with PBRT between March 1984 and December 1998. Data were analyzed as of September 1999. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 89 years; there were 1,188 men and 1,247 women. The largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 26 mm, and tumor thickness from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 40 months. RESULTS: Local tumor control probability at 5 years was improved from 90.6 +/- 1.7% for patients treated before 1988, to 96.3 +/- 0.6% for patients treated between 1989 and 1993, and became 98.9 +/- 0.6% for patients treated after 1993. Among 2,435 treated patients, 73 (3%) had to receive a second treatment because of tumor regrowth. Cause-specific survival at 10 years was calculated to 72.6 +/- 1.9% for patients with controlled tumors compared to 47.5 +/- 6.5% for those with recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: Reduced safety margins, large ciliary body tumors, eyelids within the treatment field, inadequate positioning of tantalum clips, and male gender were identified to be the main factors impairing local tumor control. The improvement of local tumor control rate after 1993 is attributed to changes implemented in the treatment procedure. Our data strongly support that the rate of death by metastases is influenced by local tumor control failure: improvement of the local tumor control rate results in a better survival rate

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. A total of 2645 patients (2648 eyes) with uveal melanoma were treated between 1984 and 1999 with proton beam radiotherapy. Data were analyzed as of February 2001. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 90 years, 1284 were men, and 1361 were women. Largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 27.5 mm, and tumor height from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization

One hundred and forty-nine were treated with low LET radiation alone (60Co gamma rays) and 108 with a combination of gamma rays and fast neutrons of mean energy 6 MeV, one-fifth to one-third of the effective dose being from neutrons. The response was analysed by histological examination of the autopsy specimens. Tumour cell destruction was found to be significantly greater in the neutron-treated series. The two series were not strictly randomized but were closely similar to terms of tumour volume, histological grade and total treatment time. The sequence of treatments with neutrons and gamma rays (N-gamma, gamma-N, gamma-N -gamma) was found to have no influence on the results

Data on cancer incidence in Europe, Austria, and neighbouring countries are reviewed for the most frequent tumors suitable for charged particle therapy. From these data, the numbers of potential patients suitable for MED-AUSTRON are derived for each tumor site by applying the coefficients proposed in the EULIMA-1992 feasibility study. Whatever the assumptions made, a sufficient and adequate recruitment for MED-AUSTRON can be expected. However, an appropriate referring system has to be established within Austria and also in the neighbouring countries

However, in general, it is totally overwhelmed by the benefit of the treatment. The same is true to a large extent for the combinations of radiation and drug therapy. After fast neutron therapy, the risk of induction of a second cancer is greater than after photon therapy. Neutron RBE increases with decreasing dose and there is a wide evidence that neutron RBE is greater for cancer induction (and for other late effects relevant in radiation protection) than for cell killing. Animal data on RBE for tumor induction are reviewed, as well as other biological effects such as life shortening, malignant cell transformation in vitro, chromosome aberrations, genetic effects. These effects can be related, directly or indirectly, to cancer induction to the extent that they express a "genomic" lesion. Almost no reliable human epidemiological data are available so far. For fission neutrons a RBE for cancer induction of about 20 relative to photons seems to be a reasonable assumption. For fast neutrons, due to the difference in energy spectrum, a RBE of 10 can be assumed. After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average). The RBE of heavy-ions for cancer induction can be assumed to be similar to fission neutrons, i.e. about 20 relative to photons. However, after heavy-ion beam therapy, the risk should be divided by 3, as after proton therapy due to the excellent physical selectivity of the irradiation. Therefore a risk 5 to 10 times higher than photons could be assumed. This range is probably a pessimistic estimate for carbon ions since most of the normal tissues, at the level of the initial plateau, are irradiated with low-LET radiation	
0	2763	Stereotactic single high dose radiation therapy of benign intracranial meningiomas	Adult, Aged, Brain, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tungsten, Universities	Seventeen patients with intracranial meningiomas were treated with single high dose irradiation at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

Surgical excision is the treatment of choice; an alternative is embolization. Radiation therapy is indicated: (1) for angiomas in vital or sensitive regions of the brain where they cannot be excised without the risk of a disabling neurological deficit and (2) for residual angiomas after partial embolization or incomplete surgical removal. The most effective radiotherapy for angiomas is radiosurgery. "Radiosurgery" is a term used for a special concept of radiotherapy. It describes stereotactically guided single high-dose irradiation. Therefore, a linear accelerator was modified at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. The precise localization of the target point and a steep dose gradient outside the target volume allow application of high doses to the tumor without damage to the surrounding normal brain tissue. Since 1984, in Heidelberg 41 patients with cerebral angiomas have been treated by stereotactic single high-dose irradiation (doses: 10-28 Gy). Eighteen patients were angiographically examined with a follow-up period longer than 18 months. In 7 patients, the pathological vessels was completely obliterated and in 6 partially. There was no change in 6 patients - all of whom received target doses of below 12 Gy

Twenty-five were in stage I (32.1%) and 35 in stage II (67.9%). All patients were submitted to staging laparotomy. Cases with large mediastinal mass were excluded from this series. Delivered doses were 44 Gy in involved areas, 40 Gy on the mediastinum and 36 Gy on uninvolved sites. Twenty-four patients in stage I (96%) and 33 in stage II (94.2%) obtained complete remission. Actuarial 10- and 20-yr overall (OS) rates were 86% and 79.1%, respectively. Event-free (EFS) and relapse-free (RFS) survival rates at 10 and 20 yr were 67.5% and 62.1%, respectively. The occurrence of disease relapse resulted in the only statistical significant prognostic factor for OS in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Distant and extranodal recurrences were significantly (P<0.01) related to a reduced OS. On multivariate analysis stage was the only determinant factor for increased RFS. Extended field RT proved to be an effective curative modality for stage I HD patients, whereas 15 out of 33 patients in stage II relapsed requiring salvage therapy. Long-term analysis of survival and treatment-related morbidity rates will improve our knowledge and assist the physicians to choose the therapeutic option to offer to HD patients

In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a "damage ratio" (DR) and a "recovery ratio" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In June 1999, the Society ordered an analysis of the state of radiation oncology. It created a survey that was sent to all radiotherapy units in Spain. A database was created in which 230 variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-four centers were analyzed, and 157 external beam irradiation, megavoltage units were counted, of which 67 were cobalt units and 90 were linear accelerators. The cobalt units worked an average of 11.4 h daily and the linear accelerators 11.6 h. The number of patients/unit/y was 472 for the cobalt units and 442 for the linear accelerators. The number of patients by physician and year was 179. Each center received a mean of 958 new patients annually. The average between the reception and start of treatment was 25.52 days (maximum 60), and it was estimated that only 38.1% of cancers were irradiated. The number of radiation oncologists working was 392. Spain has a deficit of 297 radiation oncologists. CONCLUSION: There is a need for 44 MV units and for the replacement of 67 cobalt units. The present lack of units has had an impact on palliative treatment, which has resulted in pharmacy costs. As long as these instrumental deficiencies are not solved, waiting lists will continue to be inherent to the system. There are also important staff deficiencies, in that about 297 radiation oncologists would be needed to cover the needs

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

Cytogenetic aberrations, growth alterations, responses to a second irradiation, and mutant frequencies at the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and thymidine kinase loci were determined. A greater percentage of clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles exhibited instability (defined as clones showing one or more outlying characteristics) than in the case of those that survived gamma irradiation. The phenotypes of the unstable clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles were also qualitatively different from those of the clones that survived gamma irradiation. A greater percentage (20%) of the unstable clones that survived gamma irradiation than those that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles (4%) showed an altered response to the second irradiation, while an increase in the percentage of clones that had an outlying frequency of ouabain-resistant and thymidine kinase mutants was more evident in the clones exposed to (56)Fe particles than in those exposed to gamma rays. Growth alterations and increases in dicentric chromosomes were found only in clones with more than one alteration. These results underscore the complex nature of genomic instability and the likelihood that radiation-induced genomic instability arises from different original events

Autopsy imaging is a postmortem and preautopsy diagnostic procedure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Scanning is performed with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system before autopsy. The AI results are reported to the pathologist and, in light of this information, autopsy is performed with minute precision. Autopsy imaging was performed on 37 cancer cases. In seven cases, AI was less informative than the autopsy, but in 30 cases, more precise reports on the final diagnosis were available with the combined application of autopsy and AI than autopsy alone, particularly in eight limited autopsy cases. Thus, AI provides critical and supplementary information for autopsy; furthermore, AI itself is a unique imaging system of great importance

We describe the methods developed for stereotactic neuroradiological imaging and stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery in the evaluation and treatment of the first 55 patients with deep AVMs in a clinical research protocol. We discuss the diagnosis and epidemiological characteristics of the diseases, the neurosurgical and radiosurgical methods of treatment available and the initial experience of stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery , including stereotactic neuroradiological evaluation, treatment planning, heavy-ion beams, patient treatment protocol, early clinical results, patient evaluation and follow-up studies planned, and conclusions thus far obtained

Stereotactic heavy-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery, using narrow beams of heavy ions (helium), demonstrates superior biological and physical characteristics in brain over X and gamma rays and protons, viz., improved dose distribution in the Bragg peak, sharp lateral and distal borders, and less multiple scattering and range straggling for the same residual range in CNS tissue. Examination of CNS tissue response and alteration of cerebral blood-flow dynamics related to heavy-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery is being undertaken using three-dimensional treatment planning and quantitative imaging utilizing cerebral angiography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cine-CT, xenon X-ray CT, and positron emission tomography (PET). Also under examination are the physical properties of narrow heavy-ion beams for improving methods of dose delivery and dose distribution and for establishing clinical RBE/LET and dose-response relationships for human CNS tissues. Based on the evaluation and treatment with stereotactically directed narrow beams of heavy ions of over 130 patients, with cerebral angiography and CT scanning, and with MRI and radioisotope scanning of selected patients, plus extensive clinical and neuroradiological follow-up, it appears that heavy-ion radiosurgery obliterates intracranial arteriovenous malformations or protects against rebleeding with reduced morbidity and mortality

A long-term dose-searching clinical trial protocol has been developed and we have followed more than 250 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, radiation doses ranged from 45 to 35 GyE, and now doses of 25, 20, 15 and, under special circumstances, 10 GyE, depending on a number of factors, are being evaluated. The characteristics of charged-particle beams provide a relatively homogeneous dose distribution with the 90% isodose contour to the periphery of the lesion. When the entire arterial phase of the AVM core is included in the treatment field, the rates for complete obliteration 3 years after treatment are: 90-95% for volumes less than or equal to 4 cm3; 90-95% for volumes greater than 4 and less than or equal to 14 cm3; and 60-70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3. The total obliteration rate for all volumes up to 70 cm3 is approximately 80-85%. For complete radiation-induced obliteration there is a relationship of dose and volume primarily, and location secondarily. Results on relationships between dose, AVM obliteration, and complications and sequelae of the radiosurgical procedure are presented and discussed

Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

The results of the investigation showed a poor agreement between the simulations and empirical approximations, suggesting that the formulae found in the literature can underestimate the neutron flux inside a radiotherapy room

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1975 and October 1993, 204 patients were treated for chordoma of the base of skull or cervical spine, of which 63 have developed relapse. These 63 patients constitute the main focus of this study. Forty-five patients presented with base of skull and 18 with cervical spine tumors. All patients received combined proton and photon beam radiation. The median prescribed dose was 70.1 cobalt-Gray equivalent (CGE) (range 66.6-77.4). There were 25 males and 38 females, with a median age of 41 years (range 7-66). Median follow-up was 54 months (range 8-158). RESULTS: Sixty-three of the 204 patients treated (31%) had treatment failure. Among the 63 patients who relapsed, 60 (95%) experienced local recurrence, and in 49 patients (78%), this was the only site of failure. Two of 63 patients (3%) developed regional lymph node relapse and 3 of 63 (5%) developed surgical pathway recurrence (1 left neck, 1 palate and 1 nasal cavity). Thirteen of 204 patients relapsed in distant sites, accounting for 20% (13 of 63) of all patients with recurrence in this series. The most common metastatic sites were lungs and bones presenting in 7 of 13 and 6 of 13 patients, respectively. Only 2 of 13 patients failed with isolated distant metastasis. The actuarial 3- and 5-year survival rates after local relapse (60 patients) were 44 and 5%, respectively. Following distant failure (13 patients), the 3- and 5-year survival rates were 25 and 12%, respectively. After any relapse (63 patients) the corresponding survival rates were 43 and 7%. Following local relapse, 49 of 60 patients underwent salvage therapy consisting of subtotal resection in most patients (46 of 49). The remaining 11 of 60 patients received supportive care only. Salvage therapy resulted in stable or improved status without subsequent disease progression in 26 of 49 (53%), and progressive disease in 16 of 49 patients (33%). The actuarial 2- and 5-year overall survival rates following relapse for the 49 patients who underwent salvage treatment were 63 and 6%, which favorably compared to the 2-year survival rate of 21% for those who received supportive care only (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Local relapse is the predominant type of treatment failure for chordomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Salvage treatment may relieve symptoms; however, most patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Poor long-term survival rates following relapse emphasize the importance of a combined treatment approach with experienced surgeons and radiation oncologists at the time of primary treatment. For most patients, only permanent local tumor control will offer a chance of cure

This same radiation dose is, at the same time, only moderately effective in the elimination of microscopic malignancy, let alone gross clinical disease. Numerous medical and surgical attempts to minimize this complication have been uniformly unsuccessful. With the availability of a new synthetic, absorbable, polyglycolic acid mesh, an intestinal sling surgical procedure has been devised to exclude the small bowel from the pelvis and subsequent radiation fields. Twenty-five patients have been treated by this new technique with only one complication presenting as a fungal infection. Small-bowel barium contrast studies in 16 patients referred for postoperative radiation demonstrated 13 satisfactory exclusions of the small bowel from the translateral pelvic irradiation field. In 16 evaluable patients, three had unsatisfactory exclusion two of which were due to technical error. This has permitted high-dose (5,500-6,500 cGy) radiotherapy to the critical treatment volume without posttreatment complication. Mean follow-up time is 14.8 months. Several patients have been reexplored demonstrating complete absorption of the mesh without fibrinous adhesions or other foreign body reaction. It is concluded that this new technique of small bowel exclusion will permit the routine delivery of much higher doses of radiation in patients requiring improved local-regional control of their pelvic cancers and without morbidity from radiation-associated small bowel injury

In 54 patients the tumour was located in the parotid gland, in the remaining nine patients the tumour was located in the submandibular gland, 31 patients were treated for stage I to II disease, 32 patients for stage III to IV disease. All patients were irradiated postoperatively using 60 Co. 137 Cs photons or electrons of adequate energies. As basic techniques ipsilateral portals, a wedge pair of portals or parallel opposed fields were used. The target doses ranged between 45 and 70 Gy with fractions of three to five times 2 to 3 Gy weekly, dependent on postoperative status and stage. In 25% of the patients a local recurrence was evident after radiotherapy with 13% developing distant metastases. The five-year survival was 95% for stage I, 83% for stage II, 30% for stage III and 7% for stage IV. Additionally, the prognosis varied according to lymph node involvement, grading and microscopic or macroscopic residual disease

This study has assessed the possibility of using a Philips MLC for 218 patients treated with conventionally blocked fields. It was found that MLC field shaping would have been appropriate for over 94% of such patients. The facility to treat large blocked fields has been found to be particularly useful. Use of the predefined shapes stored in the Regular Shape Library provided by Philips was evaluated and it was found that an appropriate shape was available in 52% of cases. The application of MLC fields to the treatment of different anatomical sites is discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From September 1992 to December 1996, 138 patients with FIGO Stages II and III and mean age of 56 years were treated. Median EBR to the whole pelvis was 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Parametrial boost was performed in 93% of patients, with a median dose of 14.4 Gy. Brachytherapy with HDR was performed during EBR or following its completion with a dose of 24 Gy in four weekly fractions of 6 Gy to point A. Median overall treatment time was of 60 days. Patient age, tumor stage, and overall treatment time were variables analyzed for survival and local control. Cumulative biologic effective dose (BED) at rectal and bladder reference points were correlated with late complications in these organs and dose of EBR at parametrium was correlated with small bowel complications. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 38 months. Overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control at 5 years was 53.7%, 52.7%, and 62%, respectively. By multivariate and univariate analysis, overall treatment time up to 50 days was the only statistically significant adverse variable for overall survival (p = 0.003) and actuarial local control (p = 0.008). The 5-year actuarial incidence of rectal, bladder, and small bowel late complications was 16%, 11%, and 14%, respectively. Patients treated with cumulative BED at rectum points above 110 Gy(3) and at bladder point above 125 Gy(3) had a higher but not statistically significant 5-year actuarial rate of complications at these organs (18% vs. 12%, p = 0.49 and 17% vs. 9%, p = 0.20, respectively). Patients who received parametrial doses larger than 59 Gy had a higher 5-year actuarial rate of complications in the small bowel; however, this was not statistically significant (19% vs. 10%, p = 0.260). CONCLUSION: This series suggests that 45 Gy to the whole pelvis combined with four fractions of 6 Gy to point A with HDR brachytherapy is an effective and safe fractionation schedule in the treatment of Stages II and III cervix cancer if realized up to 50 days. To decrease the small bowel complications, we decreased the superior border of the parametrial fields to the S2-S3 level and the total dose to 54 Gy

Although this therapeutic modality has been in use for a decade and although nearly 500 patients have been so treated, there are only two published reports of the pathologic examination of these eyes. Key features found on pathologic examination of our patient's enucleated eye included vascular alterations in the tumor's blood supply, lymphocytic infiltrates, and lipoidal degeneration of tumor cells. The interval from therapy to enucleation in our patient was much longer than in the several previously reported cases, a factor allowing for the development of a more cumulative radiation effect on the tumor. The extent and degree of radiation-induced necrosis in our patient's tumor were more profound than in previous reports

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children

In the former case, aneurysm and large AVM in the left visual tuber were causes of 4 hemorrhages. In the latter, AVM of subcortical nodes and internal capsule were responsible for single hemorrhage. The patients underwent intraoperative embolization of the anterior ciliary artery followed by its clipping. This allowed the authors to exclude aneurysm and to achieve obliteration of the bulk of AVM. Operation were performed under intraoperative guidance of motor and speech functions. Residual AVM were exposed to proton beam radiation. The outcomes of treatment were good. After 4 months of surgery, the male had no neurological disorders; in the female motor and speech disorders were associated with prior hemorrhage. [References: 10]

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system

We present a case report that appears to contradict this doctrine. The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and was treated with surgical resection and postoperative proton-beam radiation therapy. Approximately 16 mo after completion of therapy, MRI demonstrated two new regions of enhancement, and an FDG-PET study was performed to further characterize these lesions. FDG-PET demonstrated an area of intense hypermetabolism, and wide surgical resection was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed reactive changes and areas of necrosis. There was no evidence of either recurrent or radiation-induced tumor

This institutional phase II study was designed to assess whether dose escalation to 90 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) with conformal protons and photons in accelerated fractionation would improve local tumor control and patient survival. METHODS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, Karnofsky Performance Scale score of greater than or equal to 70, residual tumor volume of less than 60 ml, and a supratentorial, unilateral tumor. Actuarial survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 34% and 18%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months, with four patients alive 22 to 60 months postdiagnosis. Analysis by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prognostic criteria or Medical Research Council indices showed a 5- to 11-month increase in median survival time over those of comparable conventionally treated patients. All patients developed new areas of gadolinium enhancement during the follow-up period. Histological examination of tissues obtained at biopsy, resection, or autopsy was conducted in 15 of 23 patients. Radiation necrosis only was demonstrated in seven patients, and their survival was significantly longer than that of patients with recurrent tumor (p = 0.01). Tumor regrowth occurred most commonly in areas that received doses of 60 to 70 CGE or less; recurrent tumor was found in only one case in the 90-CGE volume. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 90 CGE in accelerated fractionation prevented central recurrence in almost all cases. The median survival time was extended to 20 months, likely as a result of central control. Tumors will usually recur in areas immediately peripheral to this 90-CGE volume, but attempts to extend local control by enlarging the central volume are likely to be limited by difficulties with radiation necrosis

We report the results in terms of local control, toxicity, and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with Grade 2/4 (n = 7) and Grade 3/4 (n = 13) gliomas according to the Daumas-Duport classification were treated on a prospective institutional protocol at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between 1993 and 1996. Doses prescribed to the target volumes were 68.2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE, 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE) to gross tumor in Grade 2 lesions and 79.7 CGE in Grade 3 lesions. Fractionation was conventional, with 1.8 to 1.92 CGE once per day. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, biopsy-proven Daumas-Duport Grade 2/4 or 3/4 malignant glioma, Karnofsky performance score of 70 or greater, and supratentorial tumor. Median age of the patient population at diagnosis was 35.9 years (range 19-49). Ten tumors were mixed gliomas, one an oligodendroglioma. RESULTS: Five patients underwent biopsy, 12 a subtotal resection, and 3 a gross total resection. Median interval from surgery to first radiation treatment was 2.9 months. Actuarial 5-year survival rate for Grade 2 lesions was 71% as calculated from diagnosis (median survival not yet reached); actuarial 5-year survival for Grade 3 lesions was 23% (median 29 months). Median follow-up is 61 months and 55 months for 4 patients alive with Grade 2 and 3 patients alive with Grade 3 lesions, respectively. Three patients with Grade 2 lesions died from tumor recurrence, whereas 2 of the 4 survivors have evidence of radiation necrosis. Eight of 10 patients who have died with Grade 3 lesions died from tumor recurrence, 1 from pulmonary embolus, and 1 most likely from radiation necrosis. One of 3 survivors in this group has evidence of radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Tumor recurrence was neither prevented nor noticeably delayed in our patients relative to published series on photon irradiation. Dose escalation using this fractionation scheme and total dose delivered failed to improve outcome for patients with Grade 2 and 3 gliomas

METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1981 and 1988, 15 patients with craniopharyngioma were treated in part or entirely with fractionated 160 MeV proton beam therapy. The group consisted of 5 children (median age, 15.9 years) and 10 adults (median age, 36.2 years). Median dose prescribed to the tumor was 56.9 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE). The median proton component was 26.9 CGE. Patients were treated after documented recurrence after initial surgery (n = 6) or after subtotal resection or biopsy (n = 9). None had had prior radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median observation period of surviving patients (n = 11) was 13.1 years from radiotherapy. One patient was lost to follow-up with tumor control after 5.2 years. Actuarial 10-year survival rate was 72%. Four patients have died 5-9.1 years after treatment, two from local failure. Actuarial 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. The functional status of the living adult patients is unaltered from their preradiotherapy status; all of them continued leading normal or near normal working lives. None of the patients treated as a child had experienced recurrence of tumor. One child shows learning difficulties and slight retardation, comparable to his preradiotherapy status. The others have professional achievements within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Results in terms of survival and local control are comparable with other contemporary series. Although no formal neuropsychological testing was performed, the surrogate measures of lifestyle and professional accomplishments appear to be satisfactory

Percutaneous high-voltage therapy with cobalt 60 was given to 51 patients and 35 patients were exposed to ultra-hard X-rays from al 17 MeV betatron. Taking into account tumour staging and grading, there was no difference between the two groups as far as prevention of tumour recurrence is concerned. Tumour recurrences occurred in 63-65 percent of the cases. Following betatron irradiation, there was an average five-year survival rate of 54 percent, following telecobalt irradiation, the figure was 41 percent

METHODS: Forty-eight eyes of 46 consecutive patients with subfoveal CNVM due to ARMD, not amenable to laser photocoagulation, were treated prospectively with a single proton beam exposure. Two dose regimens were evaluated: 8 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) and 14 CGE. Patients were followed for an average of 22.1 months after proton beam treatment. RESULTS: At the 12 month follow-up, 44% of eyes in the 8 CGE group and 75% of the eyes in the 14 CGE group had stabilized or improved visual acuity. Complex size in the 8 CGE group as measured on standard fluorescein angiography (FA), decreased or had no change initially but showed less effect over time, while the eyes treated with 14 CGE maintained decreased leakage over the follow-up period of 12 months. However, 11 eyes in the 14 CGE group experienced radiation retinopathy, with the onset between 3 and 30 months. Seven of these 11 eyes have demonstrated some visual loss but only 1 eye developed severe visual loss at 15 months after proton treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To date, 14 CGE has suggested a favourable influence on visual function and growth inhibition of CNVM. Proton beam irradiation appears to inhibit CNVM growth. The 14 CGE dose regimen appears to have a longer effect of CNVM growth than does 8 CGE, with overall stabilisation of visual function and growth inhibition. Radiation retinopathy has developed over time, but severe visual loss has been limited. On the basis of the incidence of radiation retinopathy, adjustments in the total radiation dosage and/or fractionation of the dosage should be considered

[German]	Aged, Electrons, Humans, Male, Neoplasms,Hormone-Dependent/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Testis, Testosterone/bl [Blood]	Irradiation of the tests of 11 patients with carcinoma of the prostate in the age from 68 to 78 years with 20 Gy (5 X 2 Gy per week) decreased the plasma testosterone levels to an average of 70,3% of the initial values. After operative orchidectomy, however, a decrease of the plasma testosterone level to only 5% the values before operation was observed. Therefore, the operative orchidectomy cannot be replaced by the irradiation of the testes. Higher irradiation doses may cause skin injuries and there is the possibility of being a real carcinogen noxe for the irradiation region too

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

The authors report the results for the electron beam therapy of 31 patients with advanced skin carcinoma. There were 15 squamous cell carcinomas, 11 basal cell carcinomas and 5 mixed, basosquamous cell carcinomas. All lesions were 3 cm or greater in maximum diameter. With follow-up ranging from 1 to 6 years, 28 patients have not evidence of disease, 1 is dead with disease, 1 is alive with suspicious residual disease and 1 is alive with recurrence. Acute and late complications are acceptable; bone, cartilage and soft tissue necrosis are not reported. The treatment results are similar to those in the literature and show the advantages of the electron beam irradiation for advanced skin carcinomas	
0	411	Preferences of healthy inner city women and the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Mastectomy/mt [Methods], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Patient Education as Topic, Patient Satisfaction, Prospective Studies, Recurrence, Socioeconomic Factors, Treatment Outcome, Urban Population	Numerous studies have shown that women of a lower education level and socioeconomic status use less breast-conserving surgery than women of a higher education level and socioeconomic status. Surveys of healthy women and the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer have been performed. However, no survey has focused exclusively on inner city women. The objective of this study was to determine the awareness, preferences, and concerns of inner-city, multiethnic women and the surgical treatment of stage I and II breast cancer, and to identify if a distinct treatment preference for mastectomy or lumpectomy exists in such a population. The study consisted of a prospective survey of volunteers, age 18 years and older, in the nononcologic clinics of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, New York. We consecutively surveyed 200 women between the ages of 18 and 75 using a 12-item form from January 2004 to May 2004. Of 200 surveys, 21 were excluded as incomplete and two women surveyed who gave a prior history of breast cancer were excluded from study, leaving 177 total surveys for analysis. Women were presented with a hypothetical diagnosis of early stage breast cancer curable by mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Women were asked about their surgery preferences, who they would seek advice from, if they would let their physician decide treatment, and their concerns if faced with a diagnosis of breast cancer. One hundred seventy-seven completed surveys were obtained; 124 (70%) women chose lumpectomy and radiation, 48 (27%) chose mastectomy, and 5 (3%) chose no treatment. Women who were educated below the collegiate level were more likely to prefer breast conservation therapy compared with those with a college education and above (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0, 3.6). Overall, most women surveyed (62%) were concerned with cancer recurrence followed by the side effects of radiation therapy (19%). Most women surveyed (63%) would make their physician principal advisor, whereas some (23%) would make their significant other the principal advisor. More women who chose mastectomy would make their physician their principal advisor (80%) versus those who chose lumpectomy (65%). More than 80 per cent of the women surveyed would have their physician decide their treatment. The women in the present study exhibited a distinct preference for breast conservation therapy over mastectomy

The incidence and severity of anxiety and depression were high in both groups; as radiotherapy continued these symptoms tended to decrease in intensity among the patients treated with the linear accelerator and to increase among the betatron patients. Patients who denied knowledge of their diagnosis were initially less depressed and remained less depressed than those who knew or suspected that they had cancer

Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome

METHODS: An echographic contrast medium consisting of phospholipidic microbubbles filled with sulphur hexafluoride (Sonovue) was used to visualize microcirculation in 25 cases of choroidal lesions already diagnosed with standardized echography (21 choroidal malignant melanomas, four disciform lesions). RESULTS: In untreated malignant melanomas contrast agent echography revealed the presence of a dense microcirculation inside the mass. In one case vitreal seeding of the contrast agent was detectable before enucleation and histological examination revealed the presence of tumoral cells. In 12 cases treated with transpupillary thermotherapy, contrast agent echographic evaluation showed heavy regression of microcirculation after 1 week, confirmed in one case by histology, and a reduction of 70-80% in dimensions after 6 months (which appeared to have stabilized at subsequent examinations). In four cases treated with proton beam brachytherapy 2 years prior to our examination, contrast agent echography showed the absence of a microvascular network and the presence of large vessels and blood lakes. In four cases of disciform lesion, deep and superficial retina-associated vascularization was observed, with a weak spread of contrast agent inside the lesion. CONCLUSION: Live representation with good resolution of choroidal malignant melanoma microcirculation was obtained

Some patients, however, develop adverse late effects following treatment and the purpose of this study was to determine which factors give rise to a poor local outcome. METHODS: The hospital records from a first cohort of 127 patients treated by protons from 1989 to 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. The presence of rubeosis was selected as a measure of significant ocular damage. Split file analysis was performed with 73 cases forming a test group with the remaining 54 cases acting as a validation group. RESULTS: Large tumour size and the presence of retinal detachment were significant, independent risk factors for developing rubeosis for both the test and validation groups. These factors also predicted subsequent enucleation for uncontrolled ocular pain. Patients with tumours too large to plaque and with an associated retinal detachment had a 90% chance of developing rubeosis within 4 years of proton beam radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a uveal melanoma too large for plaque therapy and an associated retinal detachment run a very high risk of developing rubeosis after proton beam radiotherapy and one third of individuals developing rubeosis required enucleation for pain even if local tumour control was satisfactory

A retrospective investigation	Aged, Cystectomy, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The relative 5-year survival was 32 per cent in 97 patients with T2 or T3 bladder carcinoma (1972-1978) treated with high dose radiation therapy (CRE greater than or equal to 1700 reu). A slight but significant difference was noted between the two T categories. Fifty-three patients who were tumour-free 3 to 4 months after irradiation had a 55 per cent survival. No other prognostic parameters were identified on the basis of histologic or radiologic findings. In 14 patients severe radiation complications were observed (bladder 9, small bowel 3, combined 2). In patients with radiation sensitive bladder carcinoma, radical radiation therapy seems to be a comparable alternative to total cystectomy

These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

The costs of the mobile linear accelerator with a robotic arm, used in intraoperative radiotherapy, are prohibitive for poor countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ELIOT in the accelerator room of the Radiotherapy Service for early breast cancer treatment. We analyzed 40 patients submitted to breast conservative surgery and ELIOT, in the accelerator room of the Radiotherapy Service at the Hospital of Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil from January 2004 to July 2005. Patients with unifocal breast carcinoma smaller than 25 mm, aged over 45 years, who were candidates for conservative surgery were selected and a total dose of 21Gy was delivered, without further radiotherapy. In the short-term follow-up (median 18 months), six patients (15%) presented with some grade of fibrosis under the scar. One case (2.5%) of local recurrence was reported. There are no cases of contralateral carcinoma or distant metastases so far. Our data show that intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons can be safely performed in an accelerator room with a conventional machine

METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices

In this article we have reviewed how these goals have been met. Physical aspects of this device (accuracy, dose gradient, and dose-planning speed) as well as clinical results compare favorably with any other radiosurgical experience. We believe that LINAC radiosurgical systems are advantageous in terms of cost, variety of collimator sizes available, and currently available sophistication of computerized dose planning. In the near future, the development of conformal treatment may significantly change the entire field of radiosurgery by offering heretofore unobtainable dose plans for irregularly shaped lesions. In addition, LINAC systems may be adapted for stereotactically focused fractionated radiation therapy and for radiosurgical treatment of lesions elsewhere in the body. Accuracy and computer sophistication notwithstanding, we cannot emphasize strongly enough our belief that the least important determinant of radiosurgical results is the machine used to deliver the radiation. It is absolutely vital that all groups undertaking radiosurgery include neurosurgeons, radiation physicists, and radiation therapists who have spent considerable time studying and learning the myriad details necessary to produce consistently good results. All radiosurgical patients must be followed up carefully and studied so that we can learn how to better apply this technique. Only patients who are not candidates for conventional surgery should be treated radiosurgically, at least until much more is known about long-term success and complication rates. A patient never should be treated radiosurgically simply because the referring or treating neurosurgeon is uncomfortable with proven conventional procedures. All groups performing radiosurgery should strive to adhere to the highest possible standards. We are all responsible for verifying the adequacy of our radiosurgical systems.

1	2833	Sympathetic ophthalmia complicating helium ion irradiation of a choroidal melanoma	Aged, California, Californium, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Fundus Oculi, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Inflammation, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Ophthalmia,Sympathetic/et [Etiology], Ophthalmia,Sympathetic/pa [Pathology], Radiation Injuries/co [Complications], Tantalum, Universities, Vision	Sympathetic ophthalmia was diagnosed 49 months after helium ion irradiation of a left choroidal melanoma. The patient maintained good vision until 18 months after therapy, when she developed neovascular glaucoma. This complication required multiple therapeutic procedures, including topical anti-inflammatory and antiglaucomatous drops, 360 degrees peripheral panretinal cryoblation, and a single 180 degrees application of inferior cyclocryotherapy over a 2 1/2-year period. Four weeks after the cyclocryotherapy, inflammation was noted in both eyes, and, one month later, enucleation of the left sympathogenic eye was performed. Serial histopathologic sections showed a full-thickness, fibrovascular, scleral scar and tantalum marker ring suture without uveal incarceration. Penetrating surgical trauma, a uveal melanoma, and multiple nonpenetrating treatments resulted in the development of sympathetic ophthalmia

This study evaluates modern LINAC technology for the creation of a sharp, small and functionally eloquent lesion in the thalamus. METHODS: Three patients underwent thalamotomy using a dedicated linear accelerator to radiosurgery, 2 females and 1 male, ages were 52, 53, and 73 years. Two patients presented with unilateral poststroke central pain and 1 with unilateral upper extremity pain secondary to metastatic infiltration of the brachial plexus. Maximal doses varied from 150 to 200 Gy, delivered by a 5-mm diameter collimator and 5 to 8 noncoplanar arcs evenly distributed. RESULTS: All patients gained substantial relief of their pain. They were able to reduce their medications and improve their activity levels. The patient with end-stage metastatic disease died of his malignancy 2 weeks after the treatment. One patient presented with recurrence of the pain 4 months after the treatment. No clinical complications were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated linear accelerator is able to perform a precise and circumscribed lesion in the thalamus for pain control. Moreover, it proved to be safe, because no complications were observed. For patients using chronic anticoagulant therapy or with severe disabilities caused by cardiac, pulmonary or malignant diseases, this technique represents an alternative of treatment to radiofrequency thalamotomy

This work evaluates the outcome and indications of 22 patients submitted to DLINAC radiosurgery as a primary treatment for essential trigeminal neuralgia. At last follow-up evaluation, 21 patients (95.5%) had sustained significant pain relief. DLINAC radiosurgery is safe and effective as a primary noninvasive surgical treatment for selected patients with essential trigeminal neuralgia

The true dose applied for breast carcinomas was 46 Gy (2 Gy per fraction), for testicular tumors 40 Gy were applied in the mediastinal field. 9% of the patients showed excessive infiltrations, 18% radiation pneumonitis of medium degree. In 35% of the patients slight infiltrations were found. The course of the pneumonitis was, according to its stage, regular. After a latency period 30 days post irradiation the early stadium occurs. Florid pneumonitis develops between the 45th and 90th day after irradiation. Extended radiographic effects occur up to 10 days earlier. Through a period of pneumonitis with pronounced shrinkage fibrosis develops. By CT-based individual radiation planning the pulmonary radiation reaction can be significantly reduced. The differential diagnostics of radiation effects and metastases is discussed

In this paper, the present status of BNCT for malignant melanoma was introduced. As a melanoma-targetting 10B-compound, 10B-paraboronophylalanine (BPA) was used. It was administered by multiple subcutaneous injection or intravenous drip infusion. We adopted the maximum tolerance dose to the skin as a therapeutic dose regardless of the tumor 10B concentration, because we cannot directly measure it. For this purpose, an approximation of skin concentration was made using blood data just after the administration. We treated 14 melanoma patients in this way and obtained good local control of the tumor with tolerable skin reaction. More experience with logical analysis and basic research is necessary for further development of this therapy

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22). When BNCT is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA and radiobiological considerations, promising clinical results have been obtained, although many problems and issues remain to be solved

The greatest challenge of this project is to realize treatment of a moving target by scanning irradiation. For this purpose, we decided to combine the rescanning technique and the gated irradiation method. To determine how to avoid hot and/or cold spots by the relatively large number of rescannings within an acceptable irradiation time, we have studied the scanning strategy, scanning magnets and their control, and beam intensity dynamic control. We have designed a raster scanning system and carried out a simulation of irradiating moving targets. The result shows the possibility of practical realization of moving target irradiation with pencil beam scanning. We describe the present status of our design study of the raster scanning system for the HIMAC new treatment facility	
1	1900	Proton radiation therapy (PRT) for pediatric optic pathway gliomas: comparison with 3D planned conventional photons and a standard photon technique	Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Optic Chiasm, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%, and 25% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (<20 cm3) and larger (> 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47% and 77% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11% and 16%) and pituitary gland (13% and 16%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39% and 54%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT. CONCLUSION: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues

METHODS: Retrospective review of 78 patients with 60 medium and 18 large-size choroidal melanomas at a median follow-up of 34 months. RESULTS: The 5-year data for local control, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were estimated to be 90.5 +/- 3.7%, 76.2 +/- 6.7%, and 75.6 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Eye preservation was achieved in 75.3% of patients, with useful (better than 20/200) visual acuity (VA) in 49.1% of surviving patients. Both local failure and complications led to enucleation. Prognosticators were tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.003), large tumors involving the ciliary body (p = 0.041), and local failure (p < 0.001). Prognostic factors for VA following PRT were initial VA (p = 0.001), doses to optic disc (p = 0.001) and fovea (p = 0.022) higher than 35 CGE (Cobalt Gray equivalent), tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.034), and retinal detachment (p < 0.001). Tumor basis diameter was significantly related to metastases free survival (p = 0.02), overall survival (p = 0.033), and disease specific survival (p = 0.017), but did not impair local tumor control, rate of enucleation, and VA. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that PRT is an effective and safe treatment for medium and large size choroidal melanoma. PRT can preserve the eye and its function in a reasonable percentage of patients. Further evaluation in controlled clinical trials comparing PRT to plaque radiotherapy and enucleation is required

Acceleration of tumor regression was followed by an increase in 5-year survival rates. A reverse correlation was established between growth and regression rates of cervical carcinoma. Thanks to the determination of tumor regression rates, various modalities of radiation treatment could be evaluated in the course of therapy and their efficacy predicted

The tumor mass usually surrounds the spinal cord and infiltrates vertebral bone. A combined technique using protons or electrons to boost the initial photon fields is generally applied. We evaluated the use of dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy as an alternative technique for treating advanced cervical chordoma. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A female patient with incomplete resection of a vertebral chordoma surrounding C2-C3 was irradiated with a total dose of 58 Gy (ICRU point) in 2 Gy daily fractions for 29 days between December 2001 and January 2002. Beam arrangement consisted of seven 6 MV non-opposed coplanar fields. Pretreatment quality assurance included checking of the absolute dose at reference points and 2D dose map analysis. Treatment was delivered with a 120-leaf collimator in sliding window mode. To verify the daily setup, portal images at 0 degrees and 90 degrees were compared with the simulation images before treatment delivery (manual matching) and after treatment delivery (automatic anatomy matching). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The mean dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 57.6 +/- 2.1 Gy covering 95% of the PTV per 95% isodose. The minimum dose to the PTV (D99) was 53.6 Gy in the overlapping area between the PTV and the spinal cord planning organ at risk volume (PRV). The maximum dose to the spinal cord was 42.2 Gy and to the spinal cord PRV (8 mm margin) 53.7 Gy. The mean dose to the parotid glands was 37.4 Gy (homolateral gland) and 19.5 Gy (contralateral gland). Average deviation in setup was -1.1 +/- 2.5 mm (anterior-posterior), 2.4 +/- 1.3 mm (latero-lateral), 0.7 +/- 0.9 mm (craniocaudal) and -0.43 +/- 1 degree (rotation). CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of chordomas surrounding the spinal cord, intensity-modulated radiotherapy can provide high dose homogeneity and PTV coverage. Frequent digital portal image-based setup control is able to reduce random positioning errors for head and neck cancer patients immobilized with conventional thermoplastic masks

To understand better these relations, four groups of cases were examined: 1.) 126 choroidal melanomas which were treated conservatively with Cobalt 60 applicator from 1969 till 1984. 2.) 715 choroidal melanomas which have been treated with proton-beam from 1984 to 1989. 3.) 7 tumors or pseudotumors for which for diagnostic purposes a phosphorus 32 test was necessary. 4.) 9 choroid melanomas which had conservative treatment and where vitrectomy was realized. The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment the thickness of the tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in choroid melanoma which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature

DESIGN: Longitudinal survey design with descriptive, correlational, and comparative elements. SETTING: A tertiary medical center and associated clinics in a suburban community in the Southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 185 men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled from five treatment groups: watchful waiting (n = 30), surgery (n = 59), conventional radiation (n = 25), proton-beam radiation (n = 24), and a combination of conventional radiation and proton-beam radiation or mixed-beam radiation (n = 47). At six months, 163 remained on the study; at 12 months, 154 remained: and at 18 months, 153 remained. The average age was 68 years, and 82% of the men were white. METHODS: Men were enrolled at treatment and given a questionnaire with a self-addressed, stamped envelope for return. Questionnaires were mailed again at 6, 12, and 18 months. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Health-related QOL health status, prostate treatment-specific symptoms, and sex-role identity. FINDINGS: No overall difference in health-related QOL or health status was found, but post-hoc analysis revealed specific differences. The differences existed in sexual functioning and gastrointestinal treatment-specific symptoms. No relationship existed between masculinity and health-related QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related QOL and health status are similar regardless of type of treatment. Radiation tends to produce more gastrointestinal symptoms, and surgery tends to produce more sexual functioning symptoms. Watchful waiting is associated with poorer general health. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses can provide specific treatment-related information to men who are faced with making treatment decisions for prostate cancer and, in consultation with the healthcare team, can select a treatment best sulted to them

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigated 106 tumors (27 ciliary body melanomas and 79 choroidal-ciliary melanomas) of patients treated between June 1983 and April 1998. Seventy-two patients were treated with 106-ruthenium applicators and 34 were treated with proton therapy. Some large tumors or recurrences required a second treatment. The mean follow-up period was 91 months. RESULTS: The mean tumor sizes before treatment were 6,6mm for melanoma thickness and 10.3mm for mean largest basal melanoma diameters (LTD). Of the patients studied, 71% were still alive at 5 years, 35% had metastasis and 27.7% developed recurrences. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for melanoma-related death were LTD greater than 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis, and choroidal-ciliary location. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With 71% of patients still alive at 5 years, this review shows that melanomas involving the ciliary body do not seem less severe than more posterior uveal tumors. Because of size differences between ciliary body melanomas and choroidal-ciliary melanomas, we cannot come to the conclusion that choroidal-ciliary melanomas have a poorer prognosis than ciliary body melanomas. Largest tumor diameter over 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, and macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis are important risk factors for melanoma-related death, as shown by the multivariate analysis	
1	380	Survival after primary enucleation for choroidal melanoma: changes induced by the introduction of conservative therapies	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Eye Enucleation/mo [Mortality], Female, Humans, Knowledge, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: Most uveal melanomas are currently treated by eye-preserving radiotherapies. However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling

Traditionally they are considered less responsive and even unsuitable for radiosurgery. This case report demonstrates total angiographic obliteration in a complex, large corpus callosum AVM (volume 36.52 cc) in a 39-year-old male. Stereotactic radiation was delivered with a Linear Accelerator using ultra conformal treatment planning. Large volume AVMs can be subjected to stereotactic radiosurgery if the shape and location makes it possible to deliver an adequate radiation dose

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1976 and 1992, 167 men with stages T3 to 4 prostate cancer were treated on protocol with 50.4 Gy. photons at 1.8 Gy. per fraction using a 4-field box arrangement, followed by a conformal perineal proton boost of 27 Gy. (cobalt Gy. equivalent) in 11 fractions. The chart was reviewed and 39 of the 42 surviving patients were interviewed. Median followup was 13.1 years (range 7 to 23). Normal tissue morbidity was recorded using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and the late effects normal tissue scale. RESULTS: The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater genitourinary morbidity was 59% at 15 years. However, these grade 2 or greater problems persisted to the time of the interview in only 7 of 39 cases. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater hematuria was 21% at 5 years and 47% at 15. For grade 3 or greater hematuria the risk was 3% and 8% at 5 and 15 years, respectively. No patient required cystectomy but 1 required diversion for morbidity. Urethral stricture and urinary incontinence with pads needed developed in 4 and 3 men, respectively. This particular morbidity was strongly associated with previous or subsequent prostate surgery. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal morbidity was 13% at 5 and 15 years, while grade 1 rectal bleeding occurred in another 41%. CONCLUSIONS: High dose conformal radiation to the prostate is followed by a high rate of low grade rectal bleeding but a low rate of grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal morbidity. This rate is stable and does not increase beyond 5 years. Genitourinary morbidity continues to develop well into the second decade after treatment, although high grade morbidity is uncommon. These findings do not suggest that the modern trend toward high dose prostate treatment with conformal techniques will result in a high incidence of serious and permanent late sequelae but it appears that hematuria will be common

To our knowledge, no other paper on this topic has been published so far. PATIENT: A 26-year-old man had history of concussion trauma and cataract surgery in childhood. In adult age, cataract surgery and retinal operations were followed by numerous surgical procedures and maximal medical treatment because of a secondary glaucoma. The patient refused further surgical and medical treatment with the exception of the administered systemic carbo-anhydrase inhibitor. Because of severe side-effects caused by the acetozolamide, irradiation of the ciliary processes with electrons, emitted from a linear accelerator, was performed. The total amount of 12 Gy both on the nasal and on the temporal side of the ciliary body was fractionated in several sessions. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 22 months without medication, the mean value of i.o. pressure was 22.1 mm Hg. The patient is doing well, corrected VA is 0.8. CONCLUSION: Irradiation of the ciliary processes with electrons for lowering aqueous humor secretion was effective in an otherwise non treatable case of glaucoma

The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient). Complications following treatment with electrons to a spinal field are compared with reported complications following treatment with photons to the spinal field. Although short-term reactions were minimal, the authors found no difference in late complications. More sophisticated treatment planning may show such a long-term benefit in the future	
1	1692	[Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in treatment of breast carcinoma--a new therapeutic alternative within the scope of breast-saving therapy? Current status and future prospects. Report of experiences from the European Institute of Oncology (EIO), Mailand]. [German]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Fibrosis, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Italy, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Risk, Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy, Time	BACKGROUND: External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) represents an integral component of breast-conserving treatment. In published series it has been demonstrated that the external boost can be replaced by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) where irradiation at a single dose from 10 up to 15 Gy was safely delivered directly to the tumor bed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, we initiated a dose escalation study to investigate the feasibility of applying single doses of IORT from 10 Gy up to 22 Gy. A portable IORT equipment with different electron energies was used. From July to December 1999, a total of 65 patients with T1-2 (max. 2.5 cm) No-1 breast cancer, median age 58 years (range 33-80 years) was treated. Ten patients received 10 Gy, eight patients were treated with an IORT of 15 Gy, eight received 17 Gy, six had 19 Gy, and 33 were treated with 21-22 Gy. Patients with 10 and 15 Gy received an additional EBRT of 44 and 40 Gy, respectively. In all other patients IORT was the sole radiation treatment. RESULTS: No acute side effects or intermediate untoward effects after a follow-up from three to nine months related to IORT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Since the applicator can be safely placed under the control of the surgeon and radiotherapist IORT has the potential of accurately treating the tumor bed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis. With IORT single doses of 22 Gy being equivalent to a 60 Gy EBRT can safely be delivered. Even so the average time of operation was prolonged by around 20 minutes IORT application ultimately improves the quality of life of the patients in shortening overall treatment. Long-term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate whether large single doses of IORT might have the potential of sufficient local tumor control without major side effects. As a future perspective a randomized trial comparing EBRT with IORT as sole treatment will be performed

Clinical presentation is related to local invasion. Lesion of the body of the clivus can extend ventrally or dorsally and cause cranial nerve palsies, brain stem compression or hydrocephalus. Pathologically, they form soft, grey masses that are histologically benign but locally invasive and destructive. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging clearly depict the lesion. CT better demonstrates bone destruction and intralesional calcifications. In our case, MR was performed first and showed all the classical signs of skull base chordoma. CT provided complementary information about bone destruction which are also usual in this type of lesion. Major differential diagnoses of the chordoma in the clivus are the other central skull base masses. Biopsy and histology make the diagnosis. Usually treatment consists in surgery and radiotherapy but more recently proton beam therapy is used and seems to yield better results

We performed 2 x 6 experiments in a homogeneous cylindrical and a heterogeneous elliptical phantom by adjusting 82 different patterns with different phase control inside an MR tomograph (Siemens Magnetom Symphony, 1.5 Tesla). For MR thermography, we employed the proton resonance frequency shift method with a drift correction based on silicon tubes. For the planning calculations, we used the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and, in addition, modeled the antennas and the transforming network. We generated regions according to a segmentation of bones and tissue, and used an interpolation technique with a subgrid of 0.5 cm size at the interfaces. A Gauss-Newton solver has been developed to adapt phases and amplitudes. A qualitative agreement between the planning program and measurements was obtained, including a correct prediction of hot spot locations. The final deviation between planning and measurement is in the range of 2-3 W/kg, i.e., below 10%. Additional HT phase and amplitude adaptation, as well as position correction of the phantom in the SIGMA-Eye, further improve the results. HT phase corrections in the range of 30-40 degrees and HT amplitude corrections of +/- 20-30% are required for the best agreement. The deviation /MR-FDTD/, and the HT phase/amplitude corrections depend on the type of phantom, certain channel groups, pattern steering, and the positioning error. Appropriate agreement between three-dimensional specific absorption rate distributions measured by MR-thermography and planning calculations is achieved, if the correct position and adapted feed point parameters are considered. As long as feed-point parameters are uncertain (i.e., cannot be directly measured during therapy), a prospective planning will remain difficult. However, we can use the information of MR thermography to better predict the patterns in the future even without the knowledge of feed-point parameters

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty uveal melanoma patients were selected from approximately 100 patients treated with SRT since 1996. For each patient, four treatment plans (BrainSCAN XL, V5.0) were made: conventional arc, static conformal, dynamic arc plan, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The goal of treatment planning was to fully encompass the planning target volume (PTV) by the 80% isodose while minimizing doses to the optic nerve and lens. The following parameters were evaluated: target conformity; target homogeneity; ratio of the target volume and 50% isodose volume; normal tissue receiving doses >/=80%, >/=50%, and >/=20%; central nervous system volume irradiated to >/=20%; optical nerve volume irradiated >/=50%, D(max) of the lens; lens volume receiving >/=20%; and monitor units. RESULTS: PTVs ranged from 0.68 to 4.90 cm(3) (mean 1.97 +/- 0.97 cm(3)). The average reduction of the prescription isodose volume was 1-1.5 cm(3) for conformal (range 2.6-0.3 cm(3)), dynamic arc (range 2.5-0.3 cm(3)), and IMRT plans (range 3.9-0.1 cm(3)), compared with conventional arc therapy. Central nervous system volumes irradiated to doses >/=20% were smallest for conventional or dynamic arc treatments. Average target dose homogeneity values were 1.74 +/- 0.50 for arc, 1.27 +/- 0.02 for static mMLC, 1.26 +/- 0.01 for dynamic arc, and 1.15 +/- 0.03 for IMRT plans. IMRT helped to reduce doses to the lens but did not provide an advantage for optical nerve sparing. When applying IMRT, the monitor units increased by approximately one-third compared with static mMLC-based SRT. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal mMLC and dynamic arc SRT are the treatment options of choice for Linac-based SRT of uveal melanoma. They present dosimetric advantages, while being highly efficient in treatment planning and delivery	
0	1388	Analysis of complex-type chromosome exchanges in astronauts' lymphocytes after space flight as a biomarker of high-LET exposure	Astronauts, Biological Markers, Cell Cycle, Chromosomes/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Metaphase, Radiation, Space Flight, Time, Uncertainty	High-LET radiation is more efficient in producing complex-type chromosome exchanges than sparsely ionizing radiation, and this can potentially be used as a biomarker of radiation quality. To investigate if complex chromosome exchanges are induced by the high-LET component of space radiation exposure, damage was assessed in astronauts' blood lymphocytes before and after long duration missions of 3-4 months. The frequency of simple translocations increased significantly for most of the crewmembers studied. However, there were few complex exchanges detected and only one crewmember had a significant increase after flight. It has been suggested that the yield of complex chromosome damage could be underestimated when analyzing metaphase cells collected at one time point after irradiation, and analysis of chemically-induced PCC may be more accurate since problems with complicated cell-cycle delays are avoided. However, in this case the yields of chromosome damage were similar for metaphase and PCC analysis of astronauts' lymphocytes. It appears that the use of complex-type exchanges as biomarker of radiation quality in vivo after low-dose chronic exposure in mixed radiation fields is hampered by statistical uncertainties

Between 1983 and 1988, 127 patients were treated. Results are analysed on a group of 84 patients followed 18 months and more. In 72 cases a reduction of thickness was noted. It was complete in 33 cases. Enucleation was performed in 10 patients due to no response or regrowth. In 3 cases the tumor was sterilized. Five patients died of metastases, and 73 are alive, 3 of them with liver metastases. An afterloading iridium template disk was used in 8 patients. 4 of them with a tumor thickness between 6.5 and 8 mm had a good response. Edema of the fovea was observed in 21% of cases, while cataracts were very unusual with Ru 106. An enucleation was performed in 6 patients because of a complication. A useful vision may be preserved in 60% of cases. The scleral tolerance dose is close to 1,500 Gy. These results are in agreement with those of the literature and are considered to be satisfactory for tumors not exceeding 5 to 6 mm in thickness. If the tumor is located close to the fovea or the papilla, and/or if the thickness is 8 mm or more, proton beam could be a good alternative

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect

METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe, brain stem, thalamus, or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment. The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient. Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high. Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution. One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin. The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a helium-ion particle beam. The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents. The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous malformations. RESULTS: One irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult. This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of helium-ion radiosurgery. Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately. Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations, six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels, fibrinoid necrosis, and ferrugination. However, the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls. All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels; none were completely thrombosed. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years (mean 3.5 yr) after radiation delivery. It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients. However, recurrent bleeding from AOVMs may relate to poor radiation response in some patients

Neutron capture synovectomy is a two-part modality, in which a compound containing an isotope with an appreciable thermal neutron capture cross section is injected directly into the joint, followed by irradiation with a neutron beam. Investigations to date for NCS have focused on boron neutron capture synovectomy (BNCS), which utilizes the 10B(n,alpha)7Li nuclear reaction to deliver a highly localized dose to the synovium. This paper examines the feasibility of gadolinium, specifically 157Gd, as an alternative to boron as a neutron capture agent for NCS. This alternative modality is termed Gadolinium Neutron Capture Synovectomy, or GNCS. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to compare 10B and 157Gd as isotopes for accelerator-based NCS. The neutron source used in these calculations was a moderated spectrum from the 9Be(p,n) reaction at a proton energy of 4 MeV. The therapy time to deliver the NCS therapeutic dose of 10000 RBE-cGy, is 27 times longer when 157Gd is used instead of 10B. The skin dose to the treated joint is 33 times larger when 157Gd is used instead of 10B. Furthermore, the impact of using 157Gd instead of 10B was examined in terms of shielded whole-body dose to the patient. The effective dose is 202 mSv for GNCS, compared to 7.6 mSv for BNCS. This is shown to be a result of the longer treatment times required for GNCS; the contribution of the high-energy photons emitted from neutron capture in gadolinium is minimal. Possible explanations as to the relative performance of 157Gd and 10B are discussed, including differences in the RBE and range of boron and gadolinium neutron capture reaction products, and the relative values of the 10B and 157Gd thermal neutron capture cross section as a function of neutron energy

The various elements of this equipment make possible well defined and structured procedures for treatment planning with different steps and essential tools used by this technique. We describe the means used and indicate future improvements that will lead to automation in order to provide good quality assurance, better security and substantial time saving. During the first year, 115 patients were treated with this new technique. They presented with central nervous system tumors (32 patients), lung cancer (29 patients), prostate cancer (20 patients), paranasal sinus tumors (14 patients) and tumors located in other sites (13 patients with soft sarcoma, hepato-bilary tumor, etc).

One objective of the measurements was to determine if the increases were related to changing from film dosimeters exchanged monthly to TLD-100 dosimeters exchanged quarterly. While small increases were observed in the dose equivalents of most employees, the dose equivalents of personnel operating medical electron linear accelerators with energies greater than 20 MV doubled coincidentally with the change in the personnel dosimeter program. The measurements indicated a small thermal neutron radiation component around the accelerators operated by these personnel. This component caused the doses measured with the TLD-100 dosimeters to be overstated. Therefore, the increase in these personnel dose equivalents was not due to changes in work habits or radiation environments. Either film or TLD-700 dosimeters would be suitable for personnel monitoring around high-energy linear accelerators. The final choice would depend on economics and personal preference

A combined MRI set consisting of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton-density-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and WM, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid proportional volume maps from a spatially normalized atlas were analyzed with a neural network segmentation based on a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM). Segmented maps were manually classified to identify the most hyperintense WM region and the normal-appearing genu region. Signal intensity differences normalized to the genu within each examination were generated for four time points in 228 children. A second Kohonen SOM was trained on the first examination data and divided the WM into normal-appearing or LE groups. Reviewing labels from the CAD tool revealed a consistency measure of 89.8% (167 of 186) within patients. The overall agreement between the CAD tool and the consensus reading of two trained observers was 84.1% (535 of 636), with 84.2% (170 of 202) agreement in the training set and 84.1% (365 of 434) agreement in the testing set.

1	2875	Evaluation of tumor regression and other prognostic factors for early and late metastasis after proton irradiation of uveal melanoma	Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Remission Induction, Risk, Risk Factors, Time, Time Factors, Ultrasonography, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The authors examined the relationship of change in tumor height after proton beam irradiation with the risk of metastasis in 700 patients treated for uveal melanoma before July 1, 1986. Rates of change in tumor height were computed for each patient using follow-up ultrasonographic measures during the first 2 years after treatment. Risk of metastasis was evaluated separately in the first 2 years after treatment when tumor decline was assessed (concurrent metastasis), and 2 years or later after treatment (subsequent metastasis). Using Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for other known risk factors, tumors regressing rapidly were significantly more likely to metastasize concurrently with their regression (P less than 0.05). The opposite was found for subsequent metastasis: tumors with a slow annual decline were more likely to metastasize after 2 years after treatment (P less than 0.05). Substantial changes also were noted in the ability of previously described prognostic factors (largest tumor diameter, tumor height, ciliary body involvement, and patient's age) to predict early and late metastasis. Characteristics placing individuals at high risk of metastasis may change markedly with time after treatment

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

In operable rectal cancer intensive irradiation at a single focal dose of 6.5 Gy and summary dose of 19.5 Gy (3 daily fractions), in operable colonic cancer 4 and 20 Gy (5 daily fractions respectively). The five-year survival rate attained during combined treatment of rectal cancer exceeded that after radical operations by 30%. Fractional-extended irradiation at a single focal dose of 4 Gy and summary dose of 40 Gy (every other day) in 44.6% of the patients permitted one to make locally disseminated rectal cancer resectable. Preoperative irradiation of locally disseminated rectal cancer with a preliminary synchronization of the tumor cell division cycle with 5-fluorouracil (a single focal dose of 6 Gy, summary dose of 36 Gy for irradiation twice a week) was well tolerated by the patients, and its effect on tumors was more noticeable as compared to radiotherapy only. Marked radiation reactions were absent in colonic cancer, radical operation (hemicolectomy) entailed no additional difficulties. Local recurrences were not noted in either of 10 patients who had been followed-up in the course of 1 year	
0	1911	Preliminary safety evaluation of a cyclotron facility for positron emission tomography imaging	Cyclotrons, Facility Design and Construction, Fluorine Radioisotopes, Humans, Nitrogen, Nitrogen Radioisotopes, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring, Radiation Protection, Radioisotopes, Safety, Safety Management, Spain, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Universities	This work describes the design characteristics of a medical imaging centre which uses positron emission tomography, with a cyclotron for fluorine-18 and nitrogen-13 production, and which has provided experimental information on operational data recorded by area dosimetry since 1995. Doses to radiopharmacy and medical staff have been measured both in normal work and in some handling incidents. Data on radiation levels in the installation have also been obtained and related to design details and shielding. Area dosimetry was carried out using a five-stationary detector network, with a sampling rate of 2 min(-1), and by thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD). Staff were also monitored by TLD, using extra chips for finger dosimetry and to duplicate individual whole-body dosimetry in order to measure doses in certain single operations. For normal work, average whole-body doses to radiopharmacy staff were between 0.03 and 0.28 mSv/month, wrist doses were between 0.42 and 2.67 mSv/month, and finger doses were between 1.4 and 7.7 mSv/day for the left hand and 0.8 and 2.4 mSv/day for the right hand; such variation reflects the differing expertise of staff and the role played by optimisation. Finger doses between 16 and 131 mSv were measured in handling incidents, and finger doses of 20.2 and 20.7 mSv for the left hand and 22.0 and 22.3 mSv for the right hand were measured during handling of a syringe without shielding, containing 3 GBq. For medical staff, contributions to the whole-body dose of 2.0 and 1.9 microSv/procedure were measured for injection and placing the patient on the examination couch, respectively. Dose measurement on the middle finger of the right hand gives an average of 70 microSv during the injection. The provisions regarding the shielding design have proved to be adequate and effective during a 3-year operational period. Operational doses to medical staff are comparatively low, while radiopharmacy staff are the most exposed. The finger doses in these professionals may exceed the annual limit, unless operational restrictions in daily practice are adopted. On-line area dosimetry records based on dose rate probes have proved to be effective both for monitoring radiation levels during the operation and for detecting changes in the behaviour of the facility in the irradiation process

Campus), 53 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma grades 3 and 4 were treated with pions between 1982 and 1985. A 3-dimensional spot-scanning treatment technique has proven to be practical. The accuracy of the beam alignment system used for treatment was reproducible daily within 2 mm. Low pion flux has hindered optimal beam shaping but this will soon be remedied as flux improves. The overall median survival observed (53 patients) is 262 days from date of first radiation treatment. Younger (less than 49 years) patients have significantly better survival than older (greater than 50 years) patients (p = 0.001). From a base line dose of 40 Gy photons whole brain and 17.5 Gy pion boost, doses were escalated to 33 Gy pions localised to the primary tumour and the median survival improved from 198 to 436 days. Survival curves for patients treated with localised pion techniques to doses above 30 Gy are significantly better than for those treated with schedules of pions mixed with photons (p = 0.04). It appears that optimal pion dose for brain tumours is 33 Gy minimum with a possible maximum of 36 Gy and doses delivered in 15 fractions in 3 weeks. Requirements for future trials are discussed

On the basis of its histopathology, the tumor must be classified as a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The latest data in the literature give cause for a little more optimism thanks to the introduction of the most recent schemes of chemotherapy combined with large-dose radiation for consolidation. Our patient was treated with chemotherapy CHOP high-dose radiation which resulted in complete disappearance of the mediastinal mass and rapid remission of the severe symptoms of mediastinal compression. After about 30 months, instrumental and laboratory findings confirm the persistence of the complete remission

Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

In four cases in which detailed microscopic examinations were performed, radiation induced tumour necrosis was evident but in all four cases viable tumour cells were also observed. No abnormalities that could be attributed to radiation were observed in brain tissue free from tumour. The therapeutic results were comparable to the results achieved by other modern therapies. The results support the view that the RBE of high-energy protons is similar to that for 60Co radiation. It is suggested that a larger radiation dose, delivered by a homogeneous, well-defined proton field could possibly result in an improved therapeutic result without undue risk of injury to normal brain tissue

Until radiation therapy gained wide acceptance in the 1980s, enucleation was the standard treatment for the tumor. Long-term results after proton beam irradiation are now available. METHODS: We developed risk score equations to estimate probabilities of the 4 principal treatment outcomes-local tumor recurrence, death from metastasis, retention of the treated eye, and vision loss-based on an analysis of 2069 patients treated with proton beam radiation for intraocular melanoma between July 10, 1975, and December 31, 1997. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 9.4 years. RESULTS: Tumor regrowth occurred in 60 patients, and 95% of tumors (95% confidence interval, 93%-96%) were controlled locally at 15 years. Risk scores were developed for the other 3 outcomes studied. Overall, the treated eye was retained by 84% of patients (95% confidence interval, 80%-87%) at 15 years. The probabilities for vision loss (visual acuity worse than 20/200) ranged from 100% to 20% at 10 years and for death from tumor metastases from 95% to 35% at 15 years, depending on the risk group. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose radiation treatment was highly effective in achieving local control of intraocular melanomas. In most cases, the eye was salvaged, and functional vision was retained in many patients. The mortality rate was high in an identifiable subset of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapies directed at microscopic liver metastases

We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments

Choroidal biopsy confirmed that the clinical diagnosis and conventional radiotherapy to one eye resulted in rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, cataract, and vitreous hemorrhage. We were able to destroy the tumors in the other eye by photocoagulation and proton beam irradiation without any adverse effects. The patient is in good health 1 1/2 years after therapy and he has 6/6 (20/20) vision in the eye that was treated

After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

The average follow-up period was 16 months. One patient developed metastatic disease and died. No eye has been enucleated and tumor regression has been observed in all 22 eyes with a follow-up of more than 12 months. This type of treatment offers definite advantages over previously used methods, can be used for the treatment of relatively large melanomas, and should be considered before enucleation

Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas	
1	2911	Preliminary results of proton beam irradiation of macular and paramacular melanomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Fovea Centralis, Humans, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Time, Visual Acuity	Proton beam irradiation has been used for the treatment of 60 eyes with choroidal melanomas located 3 mm or less from the fovea. The average follow-up period was 18 months. 86% of the treated lesions showed regression at the time of this analysis, and the 14% that did not were followed up for less than a year. Visual acuity remained the same in 47% of the treated eyes, improved in 20%, and deteriorated in 33%. 58% of the treated eyes had visual acuity of 20/100 or better at the last follow-up examination. Radiation vasculopathy with macular oedema was the most common complication, and it was observed in 22% of the treated eyes. These preliminary observations suggest that proton beam irradiation may be a reasonable alternative to enucleation even for this group of choroidal melanomas, which is considered unfavourable in respect of the preservation of visual function

Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

Thirty-three patients developed metastasis (6.5%) from 3 to 51 months following treatment. The primary site of metastasis was the liver in 28 cases (85%). Both demographic and clinical factors were considered. The three leading predictors of survival without metastasis after proton beam irradiation in order of importance were: (1) largest diameter of the tumor; (2) location of the anterior margin of the tumor; and (3) age at treatment. Worse prognosis was associated with largest tumor diameter greater than 15.0 mm, tumor involvement of the ciliary body and age at treatment older than 59 years

The median follow-up was 5.4 years, and no patient was lost to follow-up. All tumors showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 35% and 20/100 or better in 58%. Eight eyes were enucleated because of complications. Metastasis developed in 26 patients (20.5%) from 3 months to 7 years after treatment. Results indicate that proton irradiation is quite successful for achieving local control of uveal melanomas. A large proportion of the treated eyes maintained useful vision. Five-year follow-up data indicate that proton irradiation has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastasis

Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension.

Proton beam irradiation has recently been used for selected lesions. The advantage of this method is that the dose can be localized to the tumor more accurately. Other therapies include chemotherapy, photocoagulation, or, in extreme cases, enucleation. The author discusses these treatment modalities, complications, and prospects for future therapies.

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

Twenty tumors (1.9%) exhibited definitive growth between 4 months and 66 months after irradiation (median, 19 months): 10 were marginal recurrences, 5 were ring melanomas, 3 were uncontrolled tumors, and 2 were extrascleral extensions. Ten of these eyes were enucleated without further intervention, 2 patients died of metastases soon after the growth was detected, and 8 patients had further conservative therapy. In 5 other patients, tumor growth was suspected but unconfirmed and the eye was enucleated elsewhere; the 5-year probability of local tumor control based on 25 recurrences was 97% +/- 1%. There was a nonsignificant increase in the rate of metastases among patients with documented tumor recurrence (adjusted relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 3.4). Results suggest that recurrence of uveal melanomas treated by proton beam therapy is uncommon, but that treatment failure may increase risk of death from metastasis

A total of 84 patients underwent cataract extraction between 2 months and 11 years after irradiation. One year after cataract extraction, approximately half of the patients had visual acuity of 20/100 or better, and approximately one third had an acuity of 20/40 or better. Larger tumor size was highly correlated with poor visual outcome 1 year after extraction. Six patients underwent enucleation after cataract removal, five due to blind, painful eyes and one due to continued growth of a previously undiagnosed ring melanoma. The rate of metastases was not higher among patients who underwent cataract extraction (adjusted rate ratio, 0.83). Results suggest that cataract extraction offers improvement of vision in selected eyes previously irradiated for a uveal melanoma, without adding to the risk of metastases among patients undergoing the procedure

METHODS: The series consisted of a total of 92 eyes with uveal melanoma, enucleated at various intervals after proton irradiation (range, 1 month to 8 years) due to complications (n = 66) or tumor growth (n = 22), or at autopsy (n = 4). Study slides were read, using a standard protocol, by two pathologists masked to the timing of the enucleation after irradiation and the reason for the surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of inflammation decreased whereas fibrosis increased with time from 15% of cases enucleated within 12 months (early cases) to 61% of those enucleated more than 30 months (late cases) after irradiation (P for trend = 0.0005). Tumor necrosis and blood vessel damage occurred early, and the prevalence of these changes was constant over time. Excluding tumors with evidence of growth after irradiation, mitotic figures became progressively less common as the interval between irradiation and enucleation increased (P for trend = 0.015); no mitotic figures were present in 40 high-power fields more than 30 months after irradiation. CONCLUSION: Histopathologic changes in irradiated melanomas vary according to the time elapsed since irradiation. Inflammation decreases with time whereas fibrosis becomes more prevalent with time after irradiation. Among controlled tumors, mitotic figures appear only in recently irradiated tumors

METHODS: Cumulative rates for each type of opacity were estimated from among the 383 patients, treated between 1987 and 1989, who had clear lenses or minimal lens changes before irradiation. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the independent effects of tumor and treatment-related characteristics on the development of posterior subcapsular opacities in these patients. Risk factors for posterior subcapsular opacities were evaluated. RESULTS: By three years after irradiation, posterior subcapsular opacities had developed in 42% of the patients, and rates increased significantly with lens dose and with tumor height. The risk of posterior subcapsular opacities was over three times higher when the lens received a substantial dose of irradiation (adjusted relative risk, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-6.59), as compared with minimal dose, and was three times higher when the tumor was highly elevated (adjusted relative risk, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-6.40) as compared with minimally elevated lesions. Opacities in the other segments of the lens were age related. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that patients receiving therapeutic intraocular irradiation have a high risk of developing posterior subcapsular opacities. As expected, the leading risk determinant of posterior subcapsular change is the amount of irradiation received by the lens

DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 188 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas (<15 mm in diameter and <5 mm in height) near the optic disc or macula (within 4 disc diameters of either structure). METHODS: Patients were treated with proton beam therapy at doses of either 50 CGE or 70 CGE between October 1989 and July 1994, and followed up biannually through April 1998. Outcomes included visual acuity, radiation complications, melanoma recurrence, and metastasis. RESULTS: Proportions of patients retaining visual acuity of at least 20/200 were similar in the 2 dose groups at 5 years after radiation (approximately 55%). Similar numbers of patients in each group experienced tumor regrowth (2 patients at 50 CGE vs 3 patients at 70 CGE; P>.99) and metastasis (7 patients at 50 CGE vs 8 patients at 70 CGE;P=.79). Five-year rates of radiation maculopathy also were similar (for both groups, approximately 75% for tumors within 1 disc diameter and 40% for tumors >1 disc diameter from the macula). Rates of radiation papillopathy were nonsignificantly decreased in the 50-CGE treatment group when tumors were located 1 disc diameter or less from the optic disc (P=.20). Patients treated with the lower dose also experienced significantly less visual field loss. CONCLUSIONS: This level of dose reduction did not result in a lesser degree of visual acuity loss. The lower-dose group did experience significantly less visual field loss. Local tumor recurrence and metastatic death rates were similar in both dose groups. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:773-778

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival

The indications for double-dose irradiation with the same radio-element corresponded to "macroscopically abnormal" situations: immediate and prolonged radioresistance, recurrence or secondary radioresistance. Thirteen cases are called series 1 (Ruthenium) and 6 cases are called series 2 (protons). The series 1 allows a more reliable study as far as follow-up is higher (5.8 to 7.5 years) than in series 2 where the follow-up is shorter (13.6 to 29 months). Although double-dose irradiation was macroscopically efficient in 11 out of 13 cases in series 1, and in 3 out of 6 cases in series 2 (stabilization or decrease of tumour height measured before the second therapeutic session), 2 patients are deceased and 1 has a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of Ruthenium serie. Another one has also a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of protons series. Nevertheless double-dose radiotherapy allows a complementary decrease or stabilization of tumour height after a first session. It also decreases the indications for enucleation if there is no severe anatomic complications, when a tumour does not regress or recurs after a first session of radiations

High rates of recurrences due to the non penetration of therapeutic light till the sclera had led to the conception of using adjuvant thermotherapy associated with radiotherapy, through microwaves, ultrasounds or ferromagnetic seeds. In Leyden (Netherlands) was proposed the use of 810Nm laser diode initially as an adjuvant to radiotherapy and later on as primary isolated treatment ("neo adjuvant" TTT), especially for small tumours located in the posterior pole (juxta-papillary tumours). TTT used alone should not be proposed for tumours of inital height of more than 3,5 to 4mm. "Neo adjuvant" thermotherapy finds some other indications like decompensated naevi responsible for macular detachment. Bigger peripheral tumours stabilized by protonbeam therapy but associated with persistent detachment after the 12(th) month could be treated with "adjuvant" TTT. Finally the importance of the quality of the tumour edges treatment should be emphasized. [References: 20]

This article reviews the use of a commercial system, the Peacock system, which uses a special multileaf collimator (MIMiC) to deliver the dose distribution using arc therapy and segmented fields, similar to a moving strip. Although initially designed for stereotactic radiosurgery, this system has been employed to treat various body sites. More than 300 patients have been treated at our institution in the past 4 years, mainly for cranial, head-and-neck, and prostate tumors. Presently, we treat 40 to 45 patients per day with this technology using two linear accelerators operating with 10 MV and 15 MV x-rays, as Peacock has become a standard therapy procedure. Cases are presented that show the unique ability of IMRT to deliver conformal dose distributions. Why this type of technology can become a standard procedure and why it is cost-effective therapy for both the institution and the patient are discussed. [References: 17]

METHODS: Thirty-six patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery, and with conventional magnetic resonance imaging examinations at regular time intervals until the initiation of a new treatment strategy. Patients were categorized on the basis of their initial spectroscopic results, and their performance was assessed in terms of change in contrast-enhancing volume, time to further treatment, and survival. RESULTS: The trends in the overall population were toward more extensive increase in the percent contrast-enhancing volume, a decreased time to further treatment, and a reduced survival time for patients with more extensive initial metabolic abnormalities. Statistical analysis of the subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme found a significant increase in relative contrast-enhancing volume (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), a decrease in time to further treatment (P < 0.01, log-rank test), and a reduction in survival time (P < 0.01, log-rank test) for patients with regions containing tumor-suggestive spectra outside the gamma knife target, compared with patients exhibiting spectral abnormalities restricted to the gamma knife target. Further studies are needed to establish statistical significance for patients with lower-grade lesions and to confirm the results observed in this study. CONCLUSION: The pretreatment spectroscopic results provided information that was predictive of outcome for this patient pool, both in local control (change in contrast-enhancing volume) and global outcome (time to further treatment and survival). This modality may have an important role in improving the selection, planning, and treatment process for glioma patients

The purpose of this study was to use proton MR spectroscopy to investigate serial changes in recurrent malignant gliomas after gamma knife radiosurgery to characterize tissue response to high-dose radiation. METHODS: Eighteen patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with MR imaging and 3D proton MR spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery and at regular time points thereafter. Choline (Cho) and N-acetyl aspartate levels were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis and compared with levels found in normal tissue and with levels observed at previous time points. The results of the spectral analysis were then compared with the radiologic findings. Statistical comparisons were precluded by the small sample sizes involved. RESULTS: Response within the gamma knife target was observed as a reduction of Cho levels and an increase in lactate/lipid levels, typically within 6 months of treatment. Increases in Cho correlated with poor radiologic response and suggested tumor recurrence, confirmed histologically in six cases. The development of a spectral abnormality preceded a coincident increase in contrast enhancement by 1 to 2 months in nine cases. CONCLUSION: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging provided diagnostic and monitoring information before and after radiosurgery. Evaluation of metabolic changes with proton MR spectroscopy and structural changes with MR imaging improved tissue discrimination and provided correlation with histologic findings

Radiation therapy has been advocated when the location of the lung cancer precludes resection or the severity or the cardiopulmonary impairment indicates that the patient cannot withstand the proposed resection. Extended field irradiation has been shown to improve tumor control and survival. However, in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, extended field irradiation may exacerbate pulmonary insufficiency and compromise survival. Between 1975 and 1980, 29 patients with lung cancer and chronic pulmonary disease were treated by involved field irradiation (IFR). This was compared to the experience of 41 patients who had been treated prior to 1975 by extended field irradiation (EFR). The frequency of subjective response and tumor control were comparable in each group. One patient treated by IFR developed a marginal recurrence. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 7/41 (17%) EFR patients versus 2/29 (7%) IFR. Treatment related death occurred in 2/41 (5%) EFR versus 1/29 (3.3%) IFR. One year disease free survival was 8/41 (19%) EFR versus 12/29 (41%) IFR. Two of 14 (14%) IFR patients at risk five years are alive without evidence of disease

A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated

Treatment relies on a fixation system that permits a precise use of the coordinates estimated at stereotactic angiography or stereotactic computed tomography. The field of treatment can be exactly outlined in the CT images during repeat examinations, thus facilitating the recognition of changes induced by radiation. The system also allows the extent of the arteriovenous malformation, as seen at angiography, to be accurately traced in the CT sections thus enabling evaluation of possible radiation damage to surrounding brain structures. The precision of the method as well as its hypothetical merits and disadvantages are discussed. The number of patients treated is still small and the follow-up time is too short in the majority of cases to allow definite conclusions. Examples of preliminary results are given

Patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, schwannoma, and lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the brain were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after treatment with conventional photon and/or proton radiation; samples from healthy volunteers served as controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantitate the cytokines. Before irradiation, most patients had greater amounts of one or more of the cytokines compared with the mean obtained for control plasma. This was especially striking in patients with chondrosarcoma; the mean values for TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, bFGF, and EGF were 1458, 1289, 332, and 92% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. After irradiation, bFGF and total TGF-beta 1 decreased in the majority of tested subjects. In contrast, IL-1 beta was detected only in pediatric patients (all with astrocytoma) and its levels after radiation were 33 to 67% higher than at pretreatment. EGF was found in four patients; post-treatment values were 125 to 608% higher in three of the individuals. These data show that cytokines are present at elevated concentrations in the blood circulation of patients with certain types of brain tumors and that changes in their levels can be detected after radiotherapy. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether these findings contribute to morbidity or therapeutic outcome

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome

Thirty-eight had major surgery before or after irradiation. Major complications (fistula formation, carotid artery exposure or blowout requiring ligation, or major wound breakdown) occurred in 37%. The complication rates associated with surgery prior to irradiation, planned surgery following irradiation, and salvage surgery following irradiation were 0/12, 4/5, and 10/21, respectively. The complication rate for surgery following neutron irradiation alone was 73%; for surgery following mixed-beam irradiation it was 20%. The age of the patient and the interval between surgery and irradiation had no influence on the complication rate

Twenty-six patients were randomized to neutrons, and 14 patients were randomized to photons. The randomization was purposefully unbalanced in favor of the experimental treatment. The complete response rate for the neutron-treated group of patients was 52%. The complete response rate for the photon-treated group of patients was 17%. The difference is statistically significant at the p = .04 level. The two-year survival rates for the neutron-treated group and the photon-treated group were 25 and 0%, respectively. The major complication rates were not statistically significantly different for the two groups (18% for neutrons, and 33% for photons)

Patients with histologically proven tumors of T-stage T2, T3, or T4 and any N-stage originating in the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were eligible. One hundred forty-five patients were randomized to photon treatment and 177 were randomized to mixed beam treatment. No significant differences could be demonstrated between the experimental and control groups for primary tumor control or overall survival, although there was an advantage for mixed beam treatment over photon treatment for patients with metastatic cervical adenopathy (69 vs. 55% complete response rate in the nodes, p = .024). It is concluded that mixed beam radiation therapy does not offer a significant advantage over photon radiation therapy for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck

The patient retained 6/7.5 visual acuity for 2 1/2 years before he was killed in an automobile accident. The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision

The resulting neutrons can be characterized by an evaporation spectrum with a peak energy of less than 2 MeV. The neutrons are moderated in two steps: first in iron and then in carbon. Results from neutron fluence measurements in a perspex phantom placed close to the moderator are presented. Monte Carlo calculations of neutron fluence in a water phantom are also presented under some chosen configurations of spallation source and moderator. The calculations and measurements are in good agreement and show that, for proton currents of less than 0.5 mA, useful thermal-neutron fluences are attainable in the depth of the brain. However, the dose contribution from the unavoidable gamma background component has not been included in the present investigation

Specifically, the dosimetric differences from different CT scan parameters (kV, mAs) to phantoms and from different Hounsfield unit versus electron density (HU-ED) curves to patients are investigated. The absolute dose per monitor units (dose/MU) is used to quantify the results. We found that only for high-density bones (cranium, femoral tube, etc) using small field 18 MV beams, the dose/MU is up to 2% higher for CT scans using 80 kV than for 130 kV at a depth just beyond the bone and is up to 1-1.5% higher for CT scans using 80 mAs than for 300 mAs. For low-density bones (such as femoral head) and lung, the difference is 1% or less with different kV or mAs settings. The dose/MU varies with different HU-ED curves by up to 2%. The HU-ED curve from the stochiometric calibration was found to be more accurate based on a real measurement. A simplified 4-point curve provides nearly the same accuracy as the stochiometric calibration and may be used as an alternative for routine clinical application

The patients were treated seated in a fixed position with a stereotactic approach. Titanium-markers to the outer table served for identification and verification of the target positioning for dose planning and irradiation. The patients were given a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6 Gy fractions. All patients have been followed for at least 36 months. So far no meningiomas have progressed after treatment. Two patients have developed corticosteroid responsive oedema in the target area 6 moths after treatment. Late, but not serious, symptoms of side effects have been observed in one patient

The tumour has to grow considerably to show detectable volume increase on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Owing to the location at the base of the skull, a small increase in tumour volume may be hazardous. It is thus important to find a method to evaluate treatment effects earlier and potentially detect those tumours that have a tendency to grow. Nineteen patients with intracranial meningiomas were given irradiation with the 180-MeV proton beam at the Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden. The fractionation schedule used was in general a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6-Gy fractions. Serial 11C-Lmethionine PET examinations were used to evaluate the effect of stereotactic proton beam treatment. The radioactivity uptake in the tumour was evaluated as the ratio to the uptake in normal brain tissue. The follow-up period thus far is 36 months. In 15 of the 19 patients, 11C-L-methionine uptake was reduced 36 months after irradiation compared with the pre-treatment uptake of the tracer. In the total patient group the average reduction was 19.4%. Our results reveal that proton beam irradiation of meningiomas had an inhibitory effect on the methionine uptake in the meningiomas, although tumour size remained unchanged. The combination of unchanged tumour morphology and a reduction in methionine uptake after irradiation suggests that 11C-L-methionine PET might enable earlier evaluation of the treatment effect than is possible with CT or MRI

Among 4401 3-year survivors of a childhood cancer in eight French and British centres and 25120 patients younger than 20 years old at first malignant neoplasm (FMN) extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, 16 patients developed a melanoma as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). A cohort study of the French and British cohorts was performed. In a nested case-control study, the 16 patients who developed a melanoma as a SMN (cases) were matched with 3-5 controls in their respective cohort according to gender, age at the first cancer, the calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer and follow-up. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of melanoma for local doses >15 Gy, Odds Ratio (OR)=13 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.94-174). Regarding chemotherapy, we observed an increased OR for both alkylating agents and spindle inhibitors, OR=2.7 (95% CI: 0.5-14). Children treated for a gonadal tumour as a FMN were found to be at a higher risk of melanoma, OR=8.7 (95% CI: 0.9-86). The adjusted OR for the local radiation dose was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00-1.15). In conclusion, radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk of melanoma as a SMN, but only at very high doses of low linear energy transfer radiation. Common genetic origins between gonadal tumours and malignant melanomas are likely

One hundred and twenty-seven patients were identified. There were 93 T1, 26 T2 and eight T3 tumours. These patients were treated with curative radiotherapy (60-70 Gy). The survival from glottic cancer of patients with T1, T2 and T3 tumours at 5 years was estimated to be 97, 62 and 100% respectively. The local disease free survival for T1 and T2 disease at 5 years was estimated to be 82 and 65% respectively. The local disease free survival for T3 tumours at 2 years was estimated to be 63% with 5 year survival not yet reached. The surgical salvage rates for 24 radiotherapy failures were 77, 25 and 66% for T1, T2 and T3 tumours respectively. Radiotherapy remains the treatment of choice for T1 tumours and a viable alternative to primary laryngectomy in more advanced glottic tumours, with salvage surgery in reserve

In view of this, pilot studies were instituted at Massachusetts General Hospital in which 32 patients received the standard previous treatment of external beam irradiation and surgery but in addition had an intraoperative electron beam boost of 1000-1500 rad to the remaining tumor or tumor bed. For the 16 patients who presented with unresectable primary lesions, the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy has resulted in a total absence of local recurrence with a minimum 20 month follow-up, and survival rates are statistically better than for the previous group treated with only external beam irradiation and surgical resection. In the group with residual disease, again there have not been any local recurrences in the 7 patients who received all treatment modalities versus 54% and 26% for the group with gross and microscopic residual treated with only external beam techniques. The remaining 9 patients presented with recurrent unresectable lesions--3 are alive (2 NED) at greater than or equal to 3 years

The choice of therapy depends on many factors, and plaque radiotherapy is often used. OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcome of plaque radiotherapy in the management of ciliary body melanoma and to identify the risk factors associated with the development of radiation complications, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and melanoma-related death after plaque radiotherapy of ciliary body melanoma. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical records of 136 patients with ciliary body melanoma who were treated with plaque radiotherapy between July 1976 and June 1992. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the most frequent radiation complication at 5 years' follow-up was cataract, developing in 48% of the patients, followed by neovascular glaucoma (21%), retinopathy (20%), scleral necrosis (12%), and vitreous hemorrhage (11%). Visual acuity decrease (by > or =3 Snellen lines) was noted in 40% of the patients at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 8% of the patients developed recurrence, 28% had metastasis, and 22% died of melanoma-related causes by 5 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the factors predictive of radiation cataract were superonasal (P = .003) and inferior tumor meridian (P = .02) compared with inferonasal meridian and apex dose rate greater than 57 cGy/h (P = .05). The development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly related to iris involvement with the ciliary body tumor (P<.001). The factors predictive of development of radiation retinopathy were base dose rate greater than 230 cGy/h (P = .03) and the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = .05). The only predictor of metastasis was tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02). The risk factors for melanoma-related death were the presence of metastasis (P<.001), tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02), and recurrence (P = .02). Multivariate analyses showed that the most significant variables predictive of the development of scleral necrosis were intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .007). The most significant predictive factors for vitreous hemorrhage were visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 (P = .02) and intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P = .02). The best subset of independent predictors of vision decrease were mushroom tumor shape (P = .002), age older than 61 years (P = .006), and superonasal meridian (P = .04). The risks for melanoma-related death were presence of metastasis (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .01). There was no group of significant variables predictive for radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plaque radiotherapy offers 92% 5-year local control rate for ciliary body melanoma. Metastasis occurs in 28% of the patients treated with this method by 5 years. Patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in thickness are at greater risk than patients with thinner tumors for metastatic disease and melanoma-related death. Major radiation complications include radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, and scleral necrosis	
1	2968	Verification of electron beam therapy with conventional and storage phosphor images: preliminary experience	Anatomy, Electrons, Humans, Luminescent Measurements, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Technology,Radiologic, Universities	Portal verification images were generated by the photon contamination in electron beams produced by a linear accelerator during treatment of patients receiving high-energy electron radiation therapy. Both conventional and storage phosphor methods yielded projection radiographs in which anatomy of the irradiated and surrounding tissue was demonstrated. Exposed phantoms were used to confirm that the images represent a true projection of the radiation field. A preliminary series of 22 cases was evaluated by two radiotherapists and judged subjectively to be of clinical value. Geometric error, or more importantly, the lack thereof, during high-energy electron treatments was easily confirmed with this method. In three cases, the treatment protocol was corrected based on the images obtained. Because the readout process of storage phosphor images allows for gain adjustments and post-processing, the images obtained with this method were found to delineate anatomy in the treated and surrounding tissues somewhat more consistently than could conventional images

The prognostic significance of tumor grading and pelvic node involvement was analyzed. Five and 10-year survival for Stage B was 100% and 85% respectively; for Stage C it was 68% and 43% respectively. The cumulative 94% local control rate for Stage B and C cases obtained in this report suggests more effectiveness to control the disease locally with acceptable rate of complications, when radioactive gold seed implant is added

Considering carefully the different reported biochemical outcomes, the central point is whether gamma-knife radiosurgery has advantages compared to conventional radiotherapy or, furthermore, to newer medical therapies, such as long-acting somatostatin analogues or growth hormone receptor antagonists. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the outcome of 44 patients with acromegaly, who received gamma-knife surgery with the Leksell gamma knife. The median follow-up time was 1.9 years (0.5-4.3 years) post-radiosurgery. 43 of 44 patients had previously undergone pituitary surgery. RESULTS: Immediately prior to gamma-knife surgery, median xULN of patients' serum IGF-I was 1.9 times above upper limit of normal (range: 0.5-8.9 xULN [multiple of upper limit of normal range]). There was a significant decline of serum IGF-I at patients' final follow-up. We found a normal age-adjusted IGF-I in 21/44 patients (xULN of IGF-I<1). Furthermore, as the number of treated patients increased, we found an improvement in remission rate, which let us assume that there was a learning effect for the gamma-knife performing team over time. In addition, the median adenoma size decreased from 1.5 ml (0.1-6.9 ml) prior to gamma-knife therapy to 0.3 ml (no rest vol. detectable-2.4 ml) at patients' last visit. CONCLUSION: We have shown that pituitary gamma-knife surgery is effective in lowering serum IGF-I levels. At the end of the follow-up period, 48 % of our cohort had normal age-adjusted IGF-I levels

To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes	
1	2974	Neurovisual outcome following proton radiation therapy	Adult, Boston, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Color, Eye, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Optic Chiasm, Optic Chiasm/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	From February 1981 to January 1984, 20 patients with a tumor of the upper clivus received proton irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended

Among over 13,000 irradiated patients in the USA, Europe, and Japan, two major clinical indications have been documented: 1. The conservative management of choroidal melanomas, in which 98% 5-year local control can be expected at the price of low toxicity and visual preservation in approximately half of them. 2. The curative management of low-grade chondrosarcomas and chordomas of the base of the skull and cervical spine, leading to, in combination with maximal tumor resection, 84%-94% long-term survival. Other ongoing studies concern prostate, head and neck carcinomas as well as various intracranial tumors. Radiosurgical programs are being conducted generally with single fractions and under stereotactic conditions. [References: 12]

Immediate and late tolerances were excellent in all cases (follow-up 2 to 50 months). Two patients recurred locally (marginal failures), seven are alive and doing well. At Loma Linda, 28 children were treated between 1991 and 1994, 16 for a benign tumor of the brain and twelve for a malignant one. With a follow-up of seven to 49 months, three patients died (grade 2 to 4 gliomas), one is living with a persistent disease. Four children had treatment-related toxicity (one cataract, two hormonal failures and two seizures). The other children are doing well. At MGH Boston, 18 children with skull base-cervical spine chordomas have been reported. At five years, actuarial survival and disease-free survival have been 68 and 63%, respectively. Children with cervical sites had a worse prognosis (p = 0.008). Four children had radiation-related morbidity: two pituitary failures, one temporal lobe necrosis, one temporal muscle fibrosis. In this experience, such rare tumors seemed to behave in children like in adults

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Grade 1 and 4 gliomas were excluded. Patients benefited from a 3D dose calculation based on high-definition CT and MRI, a stereotactic positioning using implanted fiducial markers and a thermoplastic mask. Mean tumor dose ranged between 63 and 67 Gy delivered in five weekly sessions of 1.8 Gy in most patients, according to the histological types (doses in Co Gy Equivalent, with a mean proton-RBE of 1.1). RESULTS: With a median 18-month follow-up (range: four-58 months), local control in tumors located in the envelopes and in the skull base was 97% (33/34), and in parenchymal tumors, 43% (6/14) only. Two patients (5%) presented with a clinically severe radiation-induced necrosis (temporal lobe and chiasm). CONCLUSION: In our experience, high-dose radiation combining photons and protons is a safe and highly efficient procedure in selected malignancies of the skull base and envelopes

[Review] [58 refs]	Brachytherapy, Child, Dose Fractionation, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], France, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Research	There have been considerable technical improvements in radiation therapy for the past two decades. In children affected with cancer, these have been likely overshadowed by concommittant major chemotherapy-based advances, and at least in part ignored and misused. This article outlines principles, technological requirements, and clinical applications of innovations that aim at improving ballistical selectivity (such as conformal, intensity modulation, stereotactic photons, charged particles, and intraoperative therapies), as well as at influencing tumors and normal tissues sensitivity to radiations (such as high LET particles, and altered fractionations).

All the patients were in complete remission at the time of irradiation. Shielding of the kidneys was effected at the start of treatment and the right lobe of the liver was shielded after a dose of 20 Gy was delivered. As of January 1982, 17 of the patients were alive and free of disease with a follow-up ranging from 6 to 32 months (mean follow-up of 18.5 months). Two patients were dead from their disease. Alterations in liver chemistry were observed in 5 patients, clinical jaundice or transient hepatomegaly along with changes in liver chemistry in 4 patients, classical veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients and 7 of the patients did not develop any complication. No death from complications were observed. The contribution of the following factors such as radiotherapy dose to the liver, drugs, nutritional status and associated medical conditions, towards the development of complications have been analyzed in detail

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three-dimensional conformal dose distributions (using 6-MV and 18-MV photon beams) were generated for 33 pulmonary targets using the PB algorithm implemented in the Helax-TMS treatment planning system and then recalculated with the CC algorithm of TMS using an identical beam setup and parameters. The differences were analyzed by evaluating the dose-volume histograms for the planning target volume (PTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) and evaluating the computed absolute monitor units (MUs). The influence of the photon energy was also studied. For three cases, the results were compared with Monte-Carlo calculations. RESULTS: Use of the CC model typically showed increased dose inhomogeneity. Owing to a more accurate modeling of secondary charged particle disequilibrium at the tumor-lung interface, the beam penumbra is broadened. The median and mean target dose decreased by 13.9% and 11.2% for the PTV and 9.2% and 9.4% for the CTV, respectively, using the CC algorithm. Consequently, the average PTV dose coverage decreased by 7.1% (SD, 6.5%). On average, the MUs calculated to achieve the prescribed dose were 5.4% (SD, 5.8%) greater for the CC algorithm. The difference in MUs between the PB and CC increased with decreasing PTV size and high photon energy (18 MV; r = -0.68), reaching 26% at the maximum. CONCLUSION: The absorbed dose at the lung-tumor interface calculated by the PB algorithm was considerably greater than the dose calculated using the CC algorithm. In small targets (PTV < or = 100 cm(3)) and for 18-MV photons, the MUs calculated with PB may lead to an insufficient dose to the target volume

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

We studied these changes in the temporal lobe in six patients, following radiosurgery on the amygdala and hippocampus. (1)H MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T with short and long echo times (TE=10 and 135 ms) were used together with standard MR imaging sequences (T1-, T2-weighted). The treatment was performed by Leksell Gamma Knife with a dose of 50 Gy to the center and a 50% isodose to the margin of the target, represented by the mean volume of approximately 7.5 ml. Magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy examinations were performed at least once per year for 3 years. The most significant changes in spectra were observed approximately 1 year after the irradiation when edema in irradiated area was observed and strong signal of lipids was identified. Later, edema and lipid signals disappeared and follow-up was characterized by a decrease of NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations in the ipsilateral region of the brain to the irradiation (LCModel calculation from voxel of interest 3.8-4.5 ml positioned into the centrum of target volume). The concentration of NAA, Cr, and Cho after radiosurgery was significantly different from control values ( p<0.05) and also from concentrations in the contralateral part of the brain ( p<0.05). In the contralateral part, the concentration of NAA was significantly increased ( p<0.05) (NAA: before treatment 8.81, after treatment 11.33 mM). No radiotoxic changes were observed in the contralateral part of the brain or behind the area of target volume. The MR spectroscopy findings precluded MRI observation and MRS results completed data about the development of radiotoxic changes in the target volume

Of the heavy charged particles, protons are the least expensive to accelerate and can be manipulated to give a sharply defined high-dose volume with a rapid fall-off of dose outside the target area. The biological properties of protons do not differ significantly from X or gamma rays. Negative pi mesons require an elaborate accelerator for their production. Pions offer the possibility of concentrating energy, some of it densely ionizing with a reduced oxygen enhancement ratio and elevated biological effectiveness within the designated tumour volume, while minimizing the dose of sparsely ionizing radiation to the normal tissues traversed. High-energy heavy ions offer the greatest flexibility and allow localized dose distributions and also, with the higher Z particles, a substantial reduction of the oxygen enhancement ratio can be achieved. The ultimate choice of particle depends upon what turns out to be the most important factor in radiotherapy--an improved localization of dose or a reduction in the dependence of cell killing on the presence of molecular oxygen

Cancer risk estimates for high doses of low LET radiation are available from the epidemiological studies of the A-bomb survivors. Cancer risks at lower doses cannot be detected in epidemiological studies and must be inferred by extrapolation from the high dose risks. The standard setting bodies, such as the ICRP recommend a linear, no-threshold extrapolation of risks from high to low doses, but this is controversial. A study of mechanisms of carcinogenesis may shed some light on the validity of a linear extrapolation. The multi-step nature of carcinogenesis suggests that the role of radiation may be to induce a mutation leading to a mutator phenotype. High energy Fe ions, such as those encountered in space are highly effective in inducing genomic instability. Experiments involving the single particle microbeam have demonstrated a "bystander effect", ie a biological effect in cells not themselves hit, but in close proximity to those that are, as well as the induction of mutations in cells where only the cytoplasm, and not the nucleus, have been traversed by a charged particle. These recent experiments cast doubt on the validity of a simple linear extrapolation, but the data are so far fragmentary and conflicting. More studies are necessary. While mechanistic studies cannot replace epidemiology as a source of quantitative risk estimates, they may shed some light on the shape of the dose response relationship and therefore on the limitations of a linear extrapolation to low doses

However, the downside to IMRT is the potential to increase the number of radiation-induced second cancers. The reasons for this potential are more monitor units and, therefore, a larger total-body dose because of leakage radiation and, because IMRT involves more fields, a bigger volume of normal tissue is exposed to lower radiation doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy may double the incidence of solid cancers in long-term survivors. This outcome may be acceptable in older patients if balanced by an improvement in local tumor control and reduced acute toxicity. On the other hand, the incidence of second cancers is much higher in children, so that doubling it may not be acceptable. IMRT represents a special case for children for three reasons. First, children are more sensitive to radiation-induced cancer than are adults. Second, radiation scattered from the treatment volume is more important in the small body of the child. Third, the question of genetic susceptibility arises because many childhood cancers involve a germline mutation. The levels of leakage radiation in current Linacs are not inevitable. Leakage can be reduced but at substantial cost. An alternative strategy is to replace X-rays with protons. However, this change is only an advantage if the proton machine employs a pencil scanning beam. Many proton facilities use passive modulation to produce a field of sufficient size, but the use of a scattering foil produces neutrons, which results in an effective dose to the patient higher than that characteristic of IMRT. The benefit of protons is only achieved if a scanning beam is used in which the doses are 10 times lower than with IMRT. [References: 21]

Record-linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register identified 99 new cancers more than 2 years after 131I therapy [standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.75] vs 122 (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.88-1.42) in patients not receiving 131I. In females treated with 131I overall SIR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.14-1.83) and significantly elevated were noted for tumours of the salivary glands, genital organs, kidney and adrenal gland. No elevated risk of a subsequent breast cancer or leukaemia was noted. SIR did not change over time, arguing against a strong radiation effect of 131I. Organs that were estimated to have received more than 1.0 Gy had together a significantly increased risk of a subsequent cancer following 131I treatment (SIR = 2.59; n = 18). A significant trend was seen for increasing activities of 131I with highest risk for patients exposed to greater than or equal to 3,664 MBq (SIR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.20-2.58). No specific cancer or group of cancers could be convincingly linked to high-dose 131I exposures since SIR did not increase after 10 years of observation. However, upper confidence intervals could not exclude levels of risk that would be predicted based on data from the study of atomic bomb survivors. We conclude that the current practice of extrapolating the effects of high-dose exposures to lower-dose situations is unlikely to seriously underestimate radiation hazards for low LET radiation

Protons, neutrons, pions, boron-neutron capture therapy, and charged-nuclei therapy (with argon, carbon, helium [alpha particles], neon, nitrogen, and silicon) have been assessed for their physical, biological, and clinical effects. In the 90 years since protons and neutrons were discovered, investigations of particle therapy for cancer have helped to elucidate many fundamental radiobiological ideas, such as linear energy transfer, relative biological effectiveness, oxygen effect, and oxygen enhancement. Particle therapy has contributed to our understanding of medical ethics when neutron therapy became intertwined with the debate over standards of informed consent in radiation experiments in humans during the cold war era. Particle teletherapy and brachytherapy continue to show promise in some clinical situations. In the future, the insights of molecular biology might clarify the ideal particles for clinical situations

Semen samples were provided by men with obstructive azoospermia and spermatogenic failure who had serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) values within the normal range and either more or less than normal. Four prominent constituents of seminal plasma were identified by 1H-MRS: GPC, choline, citrate and lactate. The peak area ratios of choline/citrate as well as choline/lactate were significantly different (P < 0.01) between groups with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia. When the serum FSH values were normal in men with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia, a significant difference was found in the GPC/choline ratio (P < 0.001). When the FSH values were normal, the GPC/choline ratio appeared to be a very important parameter able to differentiate not only between cases of spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia but also between different forms of spermatogenic failure. These results demonstrate the potential use of 1H-MRS on human seminal plasma in a new approach in the management of male infertility	
1	2994	Preliminary clinical experience with linear accelerator-based spinal stereotactic radiosurgery	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Animals, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neurosurgery/td [Trends], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Research, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Spinal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Spinal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Spine/pa [Pathology], Spine/ra [Radiography], Spine/su [Surgery], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A prototype device called an extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery frame was used to deliver stereotactic radiosurgery, with a modified linear accelerator, to metastatic neoplasms in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions in five patients. In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression	
1	643	[Results of treating uveal melanoma with proton beam radiation: 10-year follow-up]. [French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Optic Disk, Radiation, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: We analyzed the long-term results of uveal melanoma treatment with proton beam irradiation in a series of patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were treated with proton beam radiation between September 1991 and December 1992. They had an initial examination including visual acuity, funduscopy, A and B scan ultrasonography of the eye, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. General examination included chest radiography and B scan ultrasonography of the liver. All tumors received a total dose of 60 cobalt-Gray equivalents (applied in four daily fractions) at the Orsay proton therapy center. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were treated with a median follow-up of 116 months. Their median age was 59 years. Thirteen tumors were anterior to the equator, 76 overlapped the equator and 78 were posterior to the equator. An initial retinal detachment was present in 41 cases. The optic disk was invaded in 10 cases. The median tumor diameter was 12 mm and the median tumor thickness was 5.8 mm. The mean initial acuity was 20/50. The survival rate was 62.93% at 10 years; 72.9% of deaths resulted from metastasis. Statistically significant risk factors for death identified in the multivariate analysis were tumor diameter greater than 12 mm (p=0.0004) and age over 60 years (p=0.0001). The metastasis rate at 10 years was 31%. The liver was affected in 97.8% of these patients. Risk factors for metastasis were the anterior site of the tumor, its volume greater than 0.4 cc and the presence of retinal detachment at diagnosis. The secondary enucleation rate at 10 years was 13.23%, mainly attributable to secondary neovascular glaucoma. The local recurrence rate was 6%. The visual acuity rate in 42.1% of patients was better than 20/100 at 10 years. Visual loss was mainly due to postradiation maculopathy and neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the long-term results found in the literature on proton beam radiation. This therapy allows good tumor control, an excellent eye retention rate, and good final visual acuity for approximately half of the patients

DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed	
1	1010	Experience with conformal proton therapy for early prostate cancer	Aged, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Treatment Outcome	A study was conducted to evaluate the use of proton beam therapy for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients	
0	3001	Intraoperative echographic localization of iodine 125 episcleral radioactive plaques for posterior uveal melanoma	Brachytherapy, Eye, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Methods, Optic Nerve, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Research, Sclera, Sclera/me [Metabolism], Sclera/us [Ultrasonography], Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography]	PURPOSE. Plaque radiotherapy has been reported to have a higher relapse rate than charged-particle radiotherapy for posteriorly located uveal melanomas, which also are more technically difficult to localize accurately. The authors used intraoperative echography in patients with posterior uveal melanoma to determine the rate of inaccurate localization of iodine 125(125I) episcleral plaques using standard localization techniques. METHODS. The authors reviewed the records of 29 consecutive patients with medium-sized posterior uveal melanomas who underwent 125I episcleral plaque radiotherapy with intraoperative echographic verification of plaque placement. RESULTS. After careful plaque placement using standard localization techniques, 4 of 29 plaques (14%) did not cover at least one tumor margin. All four of these plaques were associated with posterior tumors with at least one margin posterior to the temporal arcades. Two (7%) additional juxtapapillary plaques were displaced away from the sclera by the optic nerve. In all six cases, it was possible to immediately reposition the plaque to achieve coverage of all tumor margins. CONCLUSIONS. Placement of 125I episcleral radioactive plaques for posteriorly located uveal melanomas using standard localization techniques occasionally results in suboptimal plaque positioning. Intraoperative echography can identify plaques that are localized poorly and allows immediate adjustment to achieve optimal plaque positioning

DESIGN: The study design was a nonrandomized, retrospective clinical study. Semiparametric and nonparametric statistical techniques were used. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred sixty-six posterior uveal melanoma patients were studied. INTERVENTION: Either iodine-125 plaque or helium ion radiation therapy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local tumor recurrence and systemic metastasis were measured. RESULTS: Local tumor recurrence was detected in 66 (8.6%) of 766 irradiated tumors. The 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 10%. The recurrence pattem was horizontal/marginal in 27 patients (41%) and vertical/diffuse in 39 patients (59%). Systemic metastasis was detected in 5 patients (19%) with horizontal/marginal recurrence and in 19 patients (49%) with vertical/diffuse recurrence. After known metastatic risk factors were controlled, the relative risk for metastasis was 2.2 for horizontal/marginal recurrence and 5.1 for vertical/diffuse recurrence (P = 0.05). The actuarial rate of systemic metastasis was 2.9% per year for all patients, 6.3% per year for patients with horizontal/marginal recurrence, and 15.5% per year for patients with vertical/diffuse recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Postirradiation local recurrence of posterior uveal melanoma is a risk factor for systemic metastasis. Vertical/diffuse recurrences may be associated more strongly with metastatic disease than horizontal/marginal recurrences	
1	3005	A non-invasive method for fractionated stereotactic irradiation of brain tumors with linear accelerator	Adult, Aged, Angiography, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Stereotaxic Techniques/st [Standards], Sweden, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A new technique for fractionated stereotactic irradiation of intracranial lesions is described. The treatment is based on a versatile, non-invasive interface for stereotactic localization of the brain target imaged by computed tomography (CT), angiography or magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), and subsequent repetitive stereotactic irradiation of the target using a linear accelerator. The fractionation of the stereotactic irradiation was intended to meet the requirements of the basic principles of radiobiology. The radiophysical evaluation using phantoms, and the clinical results in a small number of patients, demonstrated a good reproducibility between repeated positionings of the target in the isocenter of the accelerator, and a high degree of accuracy in the treatment of brain lesions	
1	3007	The assessment of doses and effects from intakes of radioactive particles. [Review] [23 refs]	Absorption, Administration,Oral, Adult, Alpha Particles, Dose-Response Relationship,Drug, Fibrosis, Half-Life, Humans, Infant, Intestinal Absorption/ph [Physiology], Lead, Liver, Lung, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Skin, Tissue Distribution	The behaviour of radionuclides after entry into the body and the radiation doses received by individual tissues depend on the chemical nature of the element, the physicochemical form of the intake, the radioactive half-life of the isotope and the type and energy of the emissions. Ingestion of radionuclides in insoluble particles will result in radiation doses being delivered to tissues of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; other tissues will also be irradiated by nuclides with penetrating photons emissions (gamma) but doses may be largely confined to the GI tract for charged particle emissions (alpha, beta). Ingestion of more soluble forms will lead to greater absorption to blood and deposition in other tissues and therefore may result in greater doses to other tissues. Similar considerations apply to inhaled material and to the entry of radionuclides through cuts or wounds. For ingested materials, including particles, more information is needed on uptake and retention in intestinal tissues and consequent doses to sensitive cells, particularly for alpha emitters. There has been concern that the pattern of distribution of activity throughout irradiated tissues may influence the extent of damage, particularly for alpha emitters because of the localised deposition of energy and their greater relative biological effectiveness compared with beta/gamma emitters. Aggregation of activity has the potential to result in greater acute tissue damage and has been shown, for example, to result in focalised pneumonitis and fibrosis in the lung and ulceration of the skin. The main long-term effect of irradiation of tissues is the induction of malignant change, although hereditary disease may also be of concern following irradiation of the gonads. There are only limited data available to compare the effect on cancer induction of heterogeneous and homogeneous irradiation of tissues. However, the available information, for irradiation of the lung, skin or liver, indicates that in general nonuniform alpha irradiation from radioactive particles is no more hazardous, and may be less hazardous, than if the same activity is uniformly distributed.

1	1376	Quantitative comparisons of cancer induction in humans by internally deposited radionuclides and external radiation. [Review] [94 refs]	Alpha Particles, Animals, Bone Marrow, Bone Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Dogs, Energy Transfer, Humans, Incidence, Inhalation, Leukemia,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Linear Energy Transfer, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Plutonium, Plutonium/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Radium/ae [Adverse Effects], Radon, Radon/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Survivors, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Uncertainty	PURPOSE: To compare quantitative estimates of lifetime cancer risk in humans for exposures to internally deposited radionuclides and external radiation. To assess the possibility that risks from radionuclide exposures may be underestimated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Risk estimates following internal exposures can be made for a small number of alpha-particle-emitting nuclides. (1) Lung cancer in underground miners exposed by inhalation to radon-222 gas and its short-lived progeny. Studies of residential (222)Rn exposure are generally consistent with predictions from the miner studies. (2) Liver cancer and leukaemia in patients given intravascular injections of Thorotrast, a thorium-232 oxide preparation that concentrates in liver, spleen and bone marrow. (3) Bone cancer in patients given injections of radium-224, and in workers exposed occupationally to (226)Ra and (228)Ra, mainly by ingestion. (4) Lung cancer in Mayak workers exposed to plutonium-239, mainly by inhalation. Liver and bone cancers were also seen, but the dosimetry is not yet sufficiently good enough to provide quantitative estimates of risks. Comparisons can be made between risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer derived for radionuclide exposure and those derived for the A-bomb survivors, exposed mainly to low-LET (linear energy transfer) external radiation. Data from animal studies, using dogs and rodents, allow comparisons of cancer induction by a range of alpha- and beta-/gamma-emitting radionuclides. They provide information on relative biological effectiveness (RBE), dose-response relationships, dose-rate effects and the location of target cells for different malignancies. RESULTS: For lung and liver cancer, the estimated values of risk per Sv for internal exposure, assuming an RBE for alpha-particles of 20, are reasonably consistent with estimates for external exposure to low-LET radiation. This also applies to bone cancer when risk is calculated on the basis of average bone dose, but consideration of dose to target cells on bone surfaces suggests a low RBE for alpha-particles. Similarly, for leukaemia, the comparison of risks from alpha-irradiation ((232)Th and progeny) and external radiation suggest a low alpha RBE; this conclusion is supported by animal data. Risk estimates for internal exposure are dependent on the assumptions made in calculating dose. Account is taken of the distribution of radionuclides within tissues and the distribution of target cells for cancer induction. For the lungs and liver, the available human and animal data provide support for current assumptions. However, for bone cancer and leukaemia, it may be that changes are required. Bone cancer risk may be best assessed by calculating dose to a 50 micro m layer of marrow adjacent to endosteal (inner) bone surfaces rather than to a single 10 micro m cell layer as currently assumed. Target cells for leukaemia may be concentrated towards the centre of marrow cavities so that the risk of leukaemia from bone-seeking radionuclides, particularly alpha emitters, may be overestimated by the current assumption of uniform distribution of target cells throughout red bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime risk estimates considered here for exposure to internally deposited radionuclides and to external radiation are subject to uncertainties, arising from the dosimetric assumptions made, from the quality of cancer incidence and mortality data and from aspects of risk modelling; including variations in baseline rates between populations for some cancer types. Bearing in mind such uncertainties, comparisons of risk estimates for internal emitters and external radiation show good agreement for lung and liver cancers. For leukaemia, the available data suggest that the assumption of an alpha-particle RBE of 20 can result in overestimates of risk. For bone cancer, it also appears that current assumptions will overestimate risks from alpha-particle-emitting nuclides, particularly at low doses. [References: 94]

The physics of the proton beam in radiosurgery is explained, and the different factors of beam delivery are examined. These key factors (correspondence to shape, accuracy of delineation of volume, correspondence to volume, and accuracy of delivery vary) with each of the radiosurgical techniques, from Gamma Knife surgery to linear accelerator therapy.

1	1585	Pedicled rhinotomy for clival chordomas invaginating the brainstem	Adult, California, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Dura Mater/pa [Pathology], Dura Mater/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasal Cavity/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Invasiveness, Nose, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Rotation, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: Clival chordomas are frequently midline lesions whose posterior growth may breach the dura and invaginate the brainstem. This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation	
1	1487	Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hearing, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/pa [Pathology], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Patient Satisfaction, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time	PURPOSE: The proton beam's Bragg peak permits highly conformal radiation of skull base tumors. This study, prompted by reports of transient (30% each) and permanent (10% each) facial and trigeminal neuropathy after stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas with marginal doses of 16-20 Gy, assessed whether proton beam radiosurgery using a marginal dose of only 12 Gy could control vestibular schwannomas while causing less neuropathy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 67 years) were treated between 1992 and 1998. The mean tumor volume was 2.49 cm(3). The dose to the tumor margin (70% isodose line) was 12 Gy. The prospectively specified follow-up consisted of neurologic evaluation and MRI at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: After a mean clinical follow-up of 44 months and imaging follow-up of 34 months in 64 patients, 35 tumors (54.7%) were smaller and 25 (39.1%) were unchanged (tumor control rate 94%; actuarial control rate 94% at 2 years and 84% at 5 years). Three tumors enlarged: one shrank after repeated radiosurgery, one remained enlarged at the time of unrelated death, and one had not been imaged for 4 years in a patient who remained asymptomatic at last follow-up. Intratumoral hemorrhage into one stable tumor required craniotomy that proved successful. Thus, 97% of tumors required no additional treatment. Three patients (4.7%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus evident as increased ataxia. Of 6 patients with functional hearing ipsilaterally, 1 improved, 1 was unchanged, and 4 progressively lost hearing. Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications	
1	3010	Conformal irradiation of the prostate: estimating long-term rectal bleeding risk using dose-volume histograms	Boston, Cobalt, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/pc [Prevention & Control], Humans, Intestinal Mucosa/re [Radiation Effects], Logistic Models, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Odds Ratio, Photons, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/co [Complications], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Rectal Diseases/et [Etiology], Rectal Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Rectum, Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Risk	PURPOSE: Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) may be very useful tools for estimating probability of normal tissue complications (NTCP), but there is not yet an agreed upon method for their analysis. This study introduces a statistical method of aggregating and analyzing primary data from DVHs and associated outcomes. It explores the dose-volume relationship for NTCP of the rectum, using long-term data on rectal wall bleeding following prostatic irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Previously published data were reviewed and updated on 41 patients with Stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma treated with photons followed by perineal proton boost, including dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of each patient's anterior rectal wall and data on the occurrence of postirradiation rectal bleeding (minimum FU > 4 years). Logistic regression was used to test whether some individual combination of dose and volume irradiated might best separate the DVHs into categories of high or low risk for rectal bleeding. Further analysis explored whether a group of such dose-volume combinations might be superior in predicting complication risk. These results were compared with results of the "critical volume model," a mathematical model based on assumptions of underlying radiobiological interactions. RESULTS: Ten of the 128 tested dose-volume combinations proved to be "statistically significant combinations" (SSCs) distinguishing between bleeders (14 out of 41) and nonbleeders (27 out of 41), ranging contiguously between 60 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) to 70% of the anterior rectal wall and 75 CGE to 30%. Calculated odds ratios for each SSC were not significantly different across the individual SSCs; however, analysis combining SSCs allowed segregation of DVHs into three risk groups: low, moderate, and high. Estimates of probabilities of normal tissue complications (NTCPs) based on these risk groups correlated strongly with observed data (p = 0.003) and with biomathematical model-generated NTCPs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose-volume relationship for rectal mucosal bleeding in the region between 60 and 75 CGE; therefore, efforts to spare rectal wall volume using improved treatment planning and delivery techniques are important. Stratifying dose-volume histograms (DVHs) into risk groups, as done in this study, represents a useful means of analyzing empirical data as a function of hetereogeneous dose distributions. Modeling efforts may extend these results to more heterogeneous treatment techniques. Such analysis of DVH data may allow practicing clinicians to better assess the risk of various treatments, fields, or doses, when caring for an individual patient

CASE: A 28 year old white male sought help because of a conjunctival swelling. A biopsy made elsewhere had revealed a capillary haemangioma of the conjunctiva. Recently striking alterations of the skin led to the suspicion of a Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunohistochemical and dermatological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a Kaposi's sarcoma and viral testing of serum revealed an HIV-infection. Besides intensive antiviral therapy, our patient underwent local irradiation of the right eye, the nose and of the left shoulder with an external beam. CONCLUSIONS: Kaposi's sarcoma is the most frequent Aids-associated malignant tumor. In about 30% of all patients with Aids, a Kaposi's sarcoma is diagnosed. The angiomatous character may lead to the histopathological diagnosis of a haemangioma.Human herpes virus 8 is known to be the transforming element

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1994 to March 2000, 163 patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Analysis was performed on 54 optic nerves (ONs) corresponding to 30 patients whose ONs had been included in the irradiated volume. These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of >4 years. All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before treatment. We evaluated the dose-complication probability and the prognostic factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon ion radiotherapy, using dose-volume histograms and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age of 30 patients (14 men, 16 women) was 57.2 years. Median prescribed total dose was 56.0 gray equivalents (GyE) at 3.0-4.0 GyE per fraction per day (range, 48-64 GyE; 16-18 fractions; 4-6 weeks). Of 54 ONs that were analyzed, 35 had been irradiated with <57 GyE (maximum dose [Dmax]) resulting in no visual loss. Conversely, 11 of the 19 ONs (58%) irradiated with >57 GyE (Dmax) suffered a decrease of visual acuity. In all of these cases, the ONs had been involved in the tumor before carbon ion radiotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, a dose of 20% of the volume of the ON (D20) was significantly associated with visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of visual loss seems to be correlated with a delivery of >60 GyE to 20% of the volume of the ON	
0	1667	Applicability of a mobile accelerator for intraoperative radiation therapy to colorectal cancer	Adult, Aged, Colorectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Colorectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Costs and Cost Analysis, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Pain, Particle Accelerators, Patient Selection, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Survival Analysis, United States	PURPOSE: Intraoperative radiation therapy is reportedly effective for local control and pain relief in colorectal cancer. However, this treatment requires a large number of medical personnel, which hinders expanded use of this method. A mobile electron linear accelerator for intraoperative radiation therapy has been developed and is now commercially available. This report analyzes the applicability of this accelerator to colorectal cancer. The applicability of the mobile accelerator is analyzed based on its specifications by simulating the intraoperative radiation therapy delivered to these patients with a conventional intraoperative radiation therapy unit. METHODS: From 1987 to 1999, 49 colorectal cancer patients underwent 54 surgical resections and received intraoperative radiation therapy to 75 sites. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative radiation therapy dose for colorectal cancer with the conventional unit was 22 (range, 10-30) Gy. The mean electron energy level was 10 (range, 3-30) MEV. Applicator size ranged from 4 to 10 cm in diameter. The mobile accelerator can achieve a dose rate of 10 Gy/min and an applicator unit size range of 3 to 10 cm in diameter, facilitating intraoperative radiation therapy for colorectal cancer. The electron energy limitation (12 MEV at maximum) suggests that the indications for this machine are limited. In our experience, 30 percent of patients received intraoperative radiation therapy with electron energy levels exceeding 12 MEV. Of these cases, 81 percent had macroscopic residual tumor and 69 percent had pain. CONCLUSION: An intraoperative radiation therapy mobile accelerator can cover 72 percent of the irradiation sites covered using our conventional unit. This accelerator is useful for intraoperative radiation therapy with curative intent for patients with no or slight residual tumor. Patients with gross residual tumor and pain may not be suitable

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1989 through July 2000, 225 patients with HCC underwent their first course of proton beam therapy at the University of Tsukuba. Of them, 27 with 68 lesions who had undergone two or more courses were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Median interval between the first and second course was 24.5 months (range 3.3-79.8 months). Median total dose of 72 Gy in 16 fractions and 66 Gy in 16 fractions were given for the first course and the rest of the courses, respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate and median survival period from the beginning of the first course for the 27 patients were 55.6% and 62.2 months, respectively. Five-year local control rate for the 68 lesions was 87.8%. Of the patients, 1 with Child-Pugh class B and another with class C before the last course suffered from acute hepatic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated proton beam therapy for HCC is safe when the patient has a target in the peripheral region of the liver and liver function is Child-Pugh class A

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HCC for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy. Four patients had renal failure, 2 patients had severe heart disease, 9 patients had severe cirrhosis, 1 patient had aplastic anemia, 1 patient had a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm before treatment, and 4 patients had bleeding tendency or unresectable tumors. Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to iodine, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the tumors ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm). No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for tumor treatments. RESULTS: All but 1 of the irradiated tumors were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years. Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant metastases in the lungs. Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and all recurrent tumors were controlled. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively. Grade > or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with HCC. The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with HCC who had limited treatment options. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients aged > or =80 years with HCC underwent proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 80 to 85 years (median, 81 years). Hepatic tumors were solitary in 17 patients and multiple in 4. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 135 mm (median, 40 mm) in maximum diameter. Ten, 5, and 6 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 60 Gy in 10 fractions, 66 Gy in 22 fractions, and 70 Gy in 35 fractions, respectively, according to tumor location. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period of 6-49 months (median, 16 months). Five patients showed new hepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume, 2-13 months after treatment, and 1 of them also had lung metastasis. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 100% and 72% at 3 years, respectively. Of 21 patients, 7 died 6-49 months after treatment; 2 patients each died of trauma and old age, and 1 patient each died of HCC, pneumonia, and arrhythmia. The 3-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 62%, 88%, and 51%, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or = 3 but thrombocytopenia in 2 patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy seems to be tolerable, effective, and safe for aged patients with HCC. It may contribute to prolonged survival due to tumor control

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

For the current report, the expanded role of external beam RT in the setting of HCC from palliation to cure was reviewed. A systematic literature search was undertaken using the MEDLINE data base and secondary references to identify peer-reviewed, English-language articles that reported clinical outcomes after external beam RT alone or in combination with other treatments for HCC. Abstracts from the 2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, American Gastrointestinal Association, and Society of Surgical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium also were included in the search. More than 60 articles reporting on clinical outcomes among patients who received RT for HCC have been published since 1990, including 20 articles that described unique sets of at least 15 patients. RT was used for palliation, to improve local control, and with curative intent in a wide spectrum of patients who most often were unsuitable for surgery and other treatments. Pain reduction following RT was noted in approximately 75% of patients with bone metastases from HCC who received RT. For patients with liver-confined disease treated with conformal RT, proton beam RT, and/or image guided RT with or without transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), local control response rates ranged from 40% to 90%, and the median survival ranges from 10 months to 25 months. For patients with HCC who had portal vein thrombus, the median survival after RT to treat the thrombus and/or the hepatic tumor with or without TACE ranged from 5.3 months to 9.7 months. Although outcomes after high-dose conformal RT for liver-confined HCC were excellent, the potential survival benefit of RT should be tested in randomized controlled trials that require international collaboration. 2006 American Cancer Society [References: 85]

The patients were treated with (1) a 60Co machine equipped with 45-degree wedge filters, at a total dose of 6,000-7,000 cGy, 300 cGy per fraction, 3 days a week in the period from 1970-1974; (2) 10 MeV linear accelerator X-rays from 1975-1980, and (3) 10 MeV linear accelerator X-rays and/or the 60Co machine in the period from 1981-1985, at a total dose of 6,000-7,000 cGy, 5 days a week by parallel opposing portals without wedge filters. The 5-year local control rates by radiotherapy alone were 66%, 78%, and 83%, respectively, in the three periods, and the 5-year survival rates were 77%, 97%, and 96% following salvage surgery for recurrent disease. In the 1970-1974 period, four patients developed severe laryngeal edema, and two patients had total laryngectomy without local residual tumor. In the 1975-1985 period, 16 patients had local recurrence in five years, and in five of them the tumor exhibited verrucous-like histopathological findings. In the 1975-1980 period, local recurrence was considered to result from underdosing of lesions with 10 MV X-ray beams and split-course irradiation. In the last five years of the period, the 5-year local control rate for stage I and II carcinoma of the glottis, excluding verrucous-like carcinoma, reached 90% with 10 MV X-rays combined with 60Co gamma-rays

In all patients N-acetyl-aspartate signals were decreased in tumour areas compared to the normal brain hemisphere. No recovery was seen after radiotherapy. Choline signals were increased in tumour margins of high grade gliomas and more diffusely in low grade gliomas. In 5 patients the choline resonance decreased after radiotherapy, accompanied by a shrinkage of tumour diameter on MRI. Lactate signals were present in high grade and unspecified astrocytomas and absent in most low grade gliomas. In 3 patients the lactate signal disappeared after radiotherapy. These observations indicate the feasibility of 1H-MRS in monitoring metabolic responses on radiotherapy of brain gliomas

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. With 1H-MRS imaging, high choline with low citrate signal was observed in the prostate, and in the lymph node a signal of choline-containing compounds was identified. The tissue level of the compounds in the enlarged lymph node was estimated to be 8.1 mmol/kg water. Subsequent histopathological analysis of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and computed tomography-guided biopsy of the lymph node confirmed the presence of prostate cancer in both

Symptomatic epilepsy was present in 29 patients (22.5%) before the treatment. It was markedly relieved by the radiosurgery leading to cessation of the seizures in 16 patients, the persisting seizure-free follow-up period ranging from 2 to 8 years (mean 4.5 years). In no case was the epilepsy worsened by radiosurgery. The positive effect on epilepsy was not strictly dependent on the angiographic result, suggesting that the ionizing radiation by itself could lead to inhibition of epileptic activity around the AVM

The external therapy with telecobalt or by an 18 MeV betatron was dosed from 3000 to 4000 rads. Most of the patients received an additional single intraperitoneal application of 150 mCi gold-198. The five-year survival rate of all patients was 45%, whereas it was 71% for stage I, 47% for stage II, 21% for stage III, and 4% for stage IV. In 3% out of all cases, surgical procedure was necessary because of complications. Today, an indication for intraperitoneal therapy by radioactive isotopes is only adopted in case of a ruptured malignant ovarian tumor

METHODS: Examination of 140 patients following vitreo-retinal surgery ( n=31), brachytherapy ( n=76), proton beam radiation ( n=33) and controls ( n=54) using a questionnaire together with a clinical examination of the anterior segment, tear break-up time and a Schirmer test. RESULTS: Of the treated patients 63% complained of dry eye symptoms versus 40% of the controls ( p=0.004). The tear break-up time was decreased in treated patients ( p<0.001, medians: 15 vs. 20 s). No significant difference was seen on the Schirmer test ( p=0.825; medians: 12 vs. 12 mm).

A comparison of pertinent metabolite concentrations revealed a magnetization transfer attenuation factor of the methyl and methylene resonances of creatine and phosphocreatine of 0.87 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.01). No attenuation was observed for the resonances of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate, glutamate and glutamine, choline-containing compounds, and myo-inositol. The finding for total creatine is in excellent agreement with data reported for rat brain. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of a chemical exchange of mobile creatine or phosphocreatine molecules with a small immobilized or 'bound' pool. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

Functional imaging of tumor metabolism can help with this task, but the choice of tracer is still controversial. This prospective study following up irradiated low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) was, to our knowledge, the first receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis that intraindividually evaluated the diagnostic performance of the SPECT tracers 3-[(123)I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT) and (99m)Tc(I)-hexakis(2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile) (MIBI) and the PET tracer (18)F-FDG. METHODS: We examined 17 patients, initially with histologically proven LGA and treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, who presented with new gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhancing lesions (n = 26) on MRI. At that time, MRI could not differentiate between progressive tumor and nonprogressive tumor. This MRI examination was closely followed by (18)F-FDG PET and by (99m)Tc-MIBI and (123)I-IMT SPECT. Lesions were classified as progressive tumor (n = 17) or nonprogressive tumor (n = 9) on the basis of prospective follow-up (through clinical examination, MRI, and proton MR spectroscopy) for 26.6 +/- 6.6 mo after PET or SPECT. RESULTS: (123)I-IMT yielded the best ROC characteristics and was the most accurate for classification, with an area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.991. The A(z) of (18)F-FDG (0.947) was not significantly lower than that of (123)I-IMT. The difference in the A(z) of (99m)Tc-MIBI (0.713) from the A(z) of the other tracers used in our study was highly significant (P </= 0.01). (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of low accuracy and, especially, of poor sensitivity even at modest specificity values. CONCLUSION: (123)I-IMT SPECT imaging of amino acid transport accurately detects tumor progression in patients with irradiated LGA. In contrast to (123)I-IMT, (18)F-FDG PET was slightly less accurate for classification, and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of limited value. Imaging of amino acid transport with (123)I-IMT is a valuable additional tool for the follow-up of LGA, allowing early, noninvasive differentiation of lesions with ambiguous morphology after irradiation

Positions and sizes of the ocular nozzle elements were initially defined based on experimental work, taking as a pattern functional existing facilities. Nowadays Monte Carlo (MC) calculation offers a tool to refine this geometry by adjusting size and place of beam modeling devices. Moreover, the MC tool is a useful way to calculate the dose and to evaluate the impact of secondary particles in the field of radiotherapy or radiation protection. Both LINAC and cyclotron producing x rays, electrons, protons, and neutrons are available in CAL, which suggests choosing MCNPX for its particle versatility. As a first step, the existing installation was input in MCNPX to check its aptitude to reproduce experimentally measured depth-dose profile, lateral profile, output-factor (OF), and absolute dose. The geometry was defined precisely and described from the last achromatic bending magnet of our proton beam line to the position of treated eyes. Relative comparisons of percentage depth-dose and lateral profiles, performed between measured data and simulations, show an agreement of the order of 2% in dose and 0.1 mm in range accuracy. These comparisons, carried out with and without beam-modifying device, yield results compatible to the required precision in ocular melanoma treatments, as long as adequate choices are made on MCNPX input decks for physics card. Absolute dose and OF issued from calculations and measurements were also compared. Results obtained for these two kinds of data, carried out in the simplified situation of an unmodulated beam, indicate that MC calculation could effectively complement measurements. These encouraging results are a large source of motivation to promote further studies, first in a new design of the ocular nozzle, and second in the analysis of the influence of beam-modifying devices attached to the final patient collimator, such as wedge or compensators, on dose values

We retrospectively analyzed patients with brain metastases of malignant melanoma who were treated at our institution for outcome and prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 64 patients with 122 cerebral metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery between 1986 and 2000. Twelve patients (19%) showed neurologic symptoms at the time of treatment, and 46 patients (72%) had extracerebral tumor manifestation at that time. The median dose to the 80% isodose line, prescribed to encompass the tumor margin, was 20 Gy (range, 15-22 Gy). RESULTS: Neurologic symptoms improved in five of twelve symptomatic patients. 41 patients remained asymptomatic or unchanged in their neurologic symptoms. Only five patients (8%) temporarily worsened neurologically after therapy despite no signs of tumor progression. With a mean follow-up time of 9.4 months, actuarial local control was 81% after 1 year. There was a statistically significant dose and size dependency of local tumor control. Median actuarial survival after treatment was 10.6 months. Patients without extracerebral tumor manifestation showed a superior survival (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high local tumor control rates, the prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases of malignant melanoma remains poor. Stereotactic radiosurgery has the potential of stabilizing or improving neurologic symptoms in these patients in a palliative setting

In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

These were reviewed at a minimum follow-up of three years to determine the effect of irradiation on infection, the complications and the functional result. No bacteriological infection was seen in the 44 patients who had allografts for revision of joint arthroplasty or for a tumour with no adjuvant therapy. For the 83 patients who also had chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both for a bone tumour, the rate of infection was 13%. The major mechanical complications were nonunion in seven grafts (5.5%) and fracture in eight (6%). These rates do not differ greatly from those reported for non-irradiated grafts. Our results suggest that irradiation, which remains the most convenient and acceptable method of sterilisation, does not jeopardize the clinical results

The proton beam, generated via a combination of Van de Graaff accelerator and cyclotron, is prepared by passive shaping for conformal tumor irradiation. A digital X-ray verification of the tumor location with the patient in sitting position limits the position uncertainties to a maximum of 0.3 mm. The treatment planning is performed using the program EYEPLAN. OCTOPUS, a CT-based planning program developed in cooperation with the German Cancer Research Center of Heidelberg, is under pre-clinical testing. Thus far, more than 400 patients have been irradiated. The first results are comparable to those obtained in other proton therapy centers. At the end of 2002, the University Hospital of Essen has also become a cooperation partner of the Hahn-Meitner Institute

Other work has pointed out the increased superficial dose resulting from obliquity effects when multiple tangential beams are applied to head and neck treatment, as is the general case in IMRT planning. Helical tomotherapy might be expected to result in even further enhanced superficial dose compared with conventional bilateral field treatment. We have designed a typical right oropharynx target volume in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Three different treatment techniques have been used to optimally treat this target, including bilateral static fields, eight-field IMRT and helical tomotherapy. The phantom was immobilized in a standard treatment position and treated on a Varian 2300cd linear accelerator and on a Hi-Art Helical Tomotherapy unit. 1 mm3 lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed on the surface of the phantom at a number of axial test positions. Film strips (Kodak EDR2) were either wrapped around the surface or sandwiched within the phantom. Measured doses at the surface and as a function of depth are compared with the planning system predictions for each treatment technique. The maximum surface doses on the proximal treatment side, averaged from TLDs and films, were measured to be 69-82% of the target dose with the bilateral fields yielding the lowest surface doses (69%), tomotherapy about 2% more than that (71%) and IMRT 13% more (82%). Anterior to the target volume, doses are always low for bilateral treatment. In this case the minimum anterior surface dose (chin area) was 6% of the prescription dose from that technique as compared with 26% and 35% from the IMRT and tomotherapy methods, respectively. The Eclipse and Tomotherapy planning systems both modelled deep and superficial doses well. Surface doses were better modelled by Eclipse at the test points, while the tomotherapy plans consistently overestimated the measured doses by 10% or more. Depth dose measurements, extracted from embedded films, indicated the depth of dose build-up to >99% to be the shallowest for IMRT (2-5 mm) followed by tomotherapy (5-8 mm) and bilateral fields (10-15 mm). The amount of surface dose is clearly technique dependent and should be taken into account in the planning stage

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 55 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated between 2001 and 2005 with C-ion RT based on computed tomography treatment planning. All patients had a tumor of large size or one located close to the optic disk. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of NVG for the following parameters; gender, age, dose-volumes of the iris-ciliary body and the wall of eyeball, and irradiation of the optic disk (ODI). RESULTS: Neovascular glaucoma occurred in 23 patients and the 3-year cumulative NVG rate was 42.6 +/- 6.8% (standard error), but enucleation from NVG was performed in only three eyes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant risk factors for NVG were V50IC (volume irradiated > or =50 GyE to iris-ciliary body) (p = 0.002) and ODI (p = 0.036). The 3-year NVG rate for patients with V50IC > or =0.127 mL and those with V50IC <0.127 mL were 71.4 +/- 8.5% and 11.5 +/- 6.3%, respectively. The corresponding rate for the patients with and without ODI were 62.9 +/- 10.4% and 28.4 +/- 8.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dose-volume histogram analysis with computed tomography indicated that V50IC and ODI were independent risk factors for NVG. An irradiation system that can reduce the dose to both the anterior segment and the optic disk might be worth adopting to investigate whether or not incidence of NVG can be decreased with it

We compared the actual (clinical) response with the predicted response estimated using our past experimental and clinical data, and discussed some problems to be overcome in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted an intravenous drip infusion of the compound whereby 170 mg/kg of the drug was administered over 4-5 hours before neutron irradiation. The patient was then irradiated with thermal neutrons from the Musashi Reactor at a reactor power of 100 kW and a neutron flux of 1.0 x 10(9) n/cm2/s at the collimator surface. The total absorbed dose to the melanoma and the surrounding skin was calculated by multiplying the thermal neutron fluences by the conversion factor. RESULTS: The total absorbed doses to the melanoma and the surrounding normal skin were calculated as 19.0 and 9.4 Gy, respectively. These absorbed doses were estimated at 33.5 and 14.2 RBE-Gy, respectively, assuming that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the high LET radiations was 2.0 and that each component of the mixed radiation was simply additive. The melanoma showed marked regression with mild skin reaction (dry desquamation) a month after therapy, and finally disappeared 10 months after therapy. There were no no substantial side effects. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the outcome of our calculated dose values agreed well with the clinical response and that their compatibility indicated considerable validity for our approach. However, there are still some problems-uncertainty concerning the 10B concentration in tumor and skin, determination of the total absorbed dose, and a single curative dose for malignant melanoma-to be overcome with regard to clinical use of this therapy

These tumors are believed to behave more aggressively than chordomas in adults and may have unusual morphology. This study examines a large series of pediatric skull base chordomas treated with a standardized protocol to characterize the behavior and morphology of these tumors. There were 31 males and 42 females ranging from 1 to 18 (mean 9.7) years. Forty-two cases (58%) were conventional chordomas, some of which had unusual histopathologic features. Chondroid chordomas comprised 23% of cases. Fourteen tumors (19%) were highly cellular and had a solid growth pattern with no myxoid matrix or lobular architecture. Eight of these had cytologic features of conventional chordoma cells including physaliferous cells (cellular chordoma). The remaining cellular tumors were composed of poorly differentiated epithelioid cells set in a fibrous stroma and lacked physaliferous cells (poorly differentiated chordoma). All variants studied by immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein, and vimentin. Mitoses and necrosis were seen in all variants. Follow-up data were available for all patients and ranged from 1 to 21 (mean 7.25) years. The survival rate was 81%. All but 1 patient with poorly differentiated chordoma died of disease. Overall, base of skull chordomas in children and adolescents treated with proton beam radiation have better survival than chordomas in adults. However, poorly differentiated chordomas are highly aggressive tumors

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Proton-beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn-Meitner Institute after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved

A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated	
1	571	Proton or photon irradiation for hemangiomas of the choroid? A retrospective comparison	Adolescent, Adult, Atrophy/et [Etiology], Berlin, Cataract/et [Etiology], Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Germany, Hemangioma/pa [Pathology], Hemangioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Middle Aged, Optic Nerve/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve/re [Radiation Effects], Photons, Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Retrospective Studies, Sturge-Weber Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Syndrome, Time, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare, on a retrospective basis, the results of therapy in patients with uveal hemangioma treated with photon or proton irradiation at a single center. METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas and 8 had diffuse choroidal hemangiomas (DCH) and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Of the patients, 19 were treated with photons with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy. A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All patients with DCH but 1 were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of all patients. Tumor thickness decreased in 95.4% and retinal detachment resolved in 92.9%. Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected. In all, 40.9% showed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, maximum Grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity. Retinopathy and radiation-induced optic neuropathy were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely. No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected. Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects should be part of the follow-up procedures

[German]	Calibration, Humans, Lasers, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/st [Standards], Rotation	Long-term observations of mechanical parameters have been performed in Freiburg for the last 7 years within the quality assurance of stereotactic irradiation at linear accelerators. The deviations between the laser indication and the position of the beam isocentre are recorded, as well as parameters for the stability of the couch rotation and the additional devices for patient adjustment and beam collimation. The deviations are used for the correction of the calculated isocentre coordinates. The long-term observation of the measured values and their standard deviations allow conclusions about the quality of the measuring procedure itself, the laser adjustment, the extension of the isocentre sphere, as well as the mechanical slackness of the treatment couch and the fixation device of the stereotactic ring. The standard deviations of the isocentre position were within 0.3 to 0.8 mm, those of the measurement quality approximately 0.2 mm. The analysis of long-term observation has contributed to improvements of the equipment and of quality assurance procedures

Differences in the induction and rejoining of DSBs after irradiation with ions having different LET were detected by fragment analysis. The data obtained indicate that the track structure of the traversing particle and its interaction with the different chromatin structures of the cellular DNA influence the yield as well as the distribution of the induced damage. The induction and rejoining of clustered DSBs induced by the same nitrogen ion fluence at LETs of 80-225 keV/microm were investigated by a detailed analysis of the DNA fragmentation patterns in normal human fibroblasts. The DSBs in the cells were allowed to rejoin during incubations for 0-20 h. Two separate pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols were used, optimized for separation of fragments in the size ranges 1-6 Mbp and 5 kbp-1.5 Mbp. A strong influence of LET on the level of DSB induction was evident. The DSB yield increased from 4.5 +/- 0.2 to 10.0 +/- 0.3 DSBs per particle traversal through the cell nucleus when LET increased from 80 to 225 keV/microm. Further, the size distribution of the DNA fragments showed a significant dependence on radiation quality, with an excess of fragments at 50-200 kbp and around 1 Mbp. Differences in repair kinetics were also evident, with slower rejoining for increasing LET, and the initial nonrandom fragment distributions were still present after 1 h of repair	
0	3054	Electron beam dose calculations	Air, Electrons, Humans, Lung, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Water	Electron beam dose distributions in the presence of inhomogeneous tissue are calculated by an algorithm that sums the dose distribution of individual pencil beams. The off-axis dependence of the pencil beam dose distribution is described by the Fermi-Eyges theory of thick-target multiple Coulomb scattering. Measured square-field depth-dose data serve as input for the calculations. Air gap corrections are incorporated and use data from'in-air' measurements in the penumbra of the beam. The effective depth, used to evaluate depth-dose, and the sigma of the off-axis Gaussian spread against depth are calculated by recursion relations from a CT data matrix for the material underlying individual pencil beams. The correlation of CT number with relative linear stopping power and relative linear scattering power for various tissues is shown. The results of calculations are verified by comparison with measurements in a 17 MeV electron beam from the Therac 20 linear accelerator. Calculated isodose lines agree nominally to within 2 mm of measurements in a water phantom. Similar agreement is observed in cork slabs simulating lung. Calculations beneath a bone substitute illustrate a weakness in the calculation. Finally a case of carcinoma in the maxillary antrum is studied. The theory suggests an alternative method for the calculation of depth-dose of rectangular fields

METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients with cervical carcinoma stages IIB-IVA who were treated with primary irradiation between the years 1985 and 1988 comprised the study group. The median survival of patients treated with 60cobalt units and linear accelerators was calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared using the log-rank test. Recurrence patterns were compared using chi-square analysis; p < .05 was considered significant for all tests. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five patients were treated with 60cobalt units (Group 1) and 53 patients were treated with a linear accelerator (Group 2). Group 1 and 2 were similar with regard to mean age and weight, stage distribution, and mean dose to point A. The rate of recurrence was comparable between Group 1 and 2 (65.6% vs. 64.2%) and no significant difference was found in overall survival between the groups (20 months vs. 21 months. p = 81). There was a trend toward increasing pelvic recurrence in Group 1 (50.8%) compared to Group 2 (35.8%, p = .08). CONCLUSIONS: 60Cobalt units and linear accelerators offer comparable rates of overall survival in patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to low LET-irradiation at: (1) low-dose rate (LDR, 1-3 Gy, 0.024 Gy h[-1]) in order to minimize genotoxic stress; (2) high dose rate (HDR, 1-3 Gy, 45 Gy h[-1]) followed by immediate mitogen stimulation; and (3) HDR followed by a recovery period of 5 days before mitogen stimulation. Subsequent analyses included cell viability and clonogenic cell survival, chromosome aberrations at the first post-irradiation mitosis, and karyotype analysis of long term cultured cells, 11-57 days after mitogen stimulation. RESULTS: Dose (1-3 Gy) and dose rate (LDR and HDR) effects on the frequency of dicentric chromosomes at the first post-irradiation mitosis were in agreement with published data, with a pronounced dose rate effect of 2 and 3 Gy exposures. G-handed karyotypes after 11 days of growth in vitro showed increased frequencies of chromosome breaks and rearrangements in all irradiated cell cultures. Clones with complex karyotype abnormalities and increased frequencies of de novo aberrations developed in the irradiated cultures during extended growth for 22-57 days. These results show that: (1) LDR-irradiation induces chromosomal instability in primary human lymphocytes; (2) mitogen stimulation rescues HDR-irradiated cells from death at the expense of an increased level of chromosome aberrations; and (3) HDR-irradiated cells that are allowed 5 days of recovery before mitogen stimulation develop chromosomal instability during subsequent long-term proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the acute genotoxic stress of HDR-irradiation compared with LDR-irradiation, nor the hypothesized conflict between mitogen-induced growth stimulation and irradiation-induced growth arrest, seem to be critical conditions for the development of chromosomal instability in primary human T lymphocytes. Post-irradiation incubation allowing apoptotic processes to remove damaged cells does not prevent the subsequent development of chromosomal instability during long-term cell proliferation

Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications

The choice is depending on the technical equipment which is available and the clinical situation. The CT simulation of a non-monoisocentric technique was evaluated in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: The field match parameters were adjusted virtually at CT simulation and were compared with parameters derived mathematically. The coordinate transfer from the CT simulator to the conventional simulator was analyzed in 25 consecutive patients. RESULTS: The angles adjusted virtually for a geometrically exact coplanar field match corresponded with the angles calculated for each set-up. The mean isocenter displacement was 5.7 mm and the total uncertainty of the coordinate transfer was 6.7 mm (1 SD). Limitations in the patient set-up became obvious because of the steep arm abduction necessary to fit the 70 cm CT gantry aperture. Required modifications of the arm position and coordinate transfer errors led to a significant shift of the marked matchline of > 1.0 cm in eight of 25 patients (32%). CONCLUSION: The virtual CT simulation allows a precise and graphic definition of the field match parameters. However, modifications of the virtual set-up basically due to technical limitations were required in a total of 32% of cases, so that a hybrid technique was adapted at present that combines virtual adjustment of the ideal field alignment parameters with conventional simulation

METHODS: T3-4 rectal cancer patients received escalating doses of oxaliplatin (day 1 and 29) with a fixed dose of capecitabine of 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily (days 1-14, 25-38) added to RT with 50.4 Gy and surgery after 6-8 weeks. The MTD, determined during phase I, was used in the subsequent phase II, in which R0 resection rate (a negative circumferential resection margin) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were evaluable. In the phase I part, oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m(2) was established as MTD. In phase II, the main toxicity was grade III diarrhea (18%). All patients underwent surgery, and 20 patients had a resectable tumor. An R0 was achieved in 17/21 patients, downstaging to T0-2 in 7/21 and a pCR in 2/21. CONCLUSION: Combination of Capox-RT has an acceptable acute toxicity profile and a high R0 resection rate of 81% in locally advanced rectal cancer. However the pCR rate was low

Exercise was performed at 30 and 60% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) until fatigue. The NMR spectra, as localized by a surface coil and improved by proton irradiation, were obtained at a high time resolution (16 s). They revealed the simultaneous presence of two pH pools during most experiments. Maximum difference in the two pH levels during exercise was 0.40 +/- 0.07 (30% MVC, n = 7) and 0.41 +/- 0.03 (60% MVC, n = 3). Complementary two-dimensional (31)P spectroscopic imaging experiments in one subject supported the supposition that the distinct pH pools reflect the metabolic status of the main muscle fiber types. The relative size of the P(i) peak in the spectrum attributed to the type II fiber pool increases with decreasing pH levels. This phenomenon is discussed in the context of the size principle stating that the smaller (type I) motor units are recruited first

This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy

Total surgical resection is rarely possible. Critical normal tissues limit the efficacy of conventional photon therapy. This study reviews our experience of using combined high dose proton and photon radiation therapy following three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1980 and September 1992, 47 patients were treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory for primary or recurrent chordomas and chondrosarcomas (group 1, 20 patients), osteogenic sarcomas (group 2, 15 patients) and giant cell tumors, osteo-or chondroblastomas (group 3, 12 patients). Radiation treatment was given postoperatively in 23 patients, pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients, and 7 patients received radiation therapy as definitive treatment modality following biopsy only. The proton radiation component was delivered using a 160 MeV proton beam and the photon component using megavoltage photons up to 23 MV energy with 1.8-2.0 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) per fraction, once a day. Total external beam target dose ranged from 55.3 CGE to 82.0 CGE with mean target doses of 73.9 CGE (group 1), 69.8 CGE (group 2), and 61.8 CGE (group 3). RESULTS: Group 1 (chordoma and chondrosarcoma): Five of 14 patients (36%) with chordoma recurred locally, and 2 out of 5 patients developed distant metastasis, resulting in 1 death from disease. A trend for improved local control was noted for primary vs. recurrent tumors, target doses > 77 CGE and gross total resection. All patients with chondrosarcoma achieved and maintained local control and disease-free status. Five-year actuarial local control and overall survival rates were 53% and 50% for chordomas and 100% and 100% for chondrosarcomas, respectively. Group 2 (osteogenic sarcoma): Three of 15 patients (20%) never achieved local control and died within 6 months of completion of radiation treatment. Only 1 out of 12 patients who were controlled for more than 6 months failed locally, yielding a 5-year local control rate of 59% for 15 patients. Overall, 4 patients (27%) developed distant metastasis (two in patients with uncontrolled primary); 4 patients succumbed to their disease, 3 patients died of intercurrent disease, resulting in overall survival of 44% at 5 years. Group 3 (giant cell tumors, osteo- and chondroblastoma): One of 8 patients with giant cell tumor failed locally, 1 patient distantly, and all patients are alive. Three of 4 patients with osteo- or chondroblastoma are alive and well. One patient suffered local recurrence and died of disease. Local control rate and overall survival for this group of 12 patients was 76% and 87% and local control for patients with giant cell tumors 83% at 5 years. In the majority of cases radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, one patient with a large base of skull tumor developed retinopathy, one patient required enucleation of a previously blind eye, and another patient with sacral tumor developed chronic diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiation therapy optimized by 3D treatment planning, allows the delivery of higher radiation doses to tumors of the axial skeleton, while respecting normal tissue constraints. High radiation doses can result in improved long-term local control

METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1998, a total of 58 patients who could be evaluated were treated for skull base tumors, 33 for chordoma and 25 for chondrosarcoma. Following various surgical procedures, residual tumor was detected in 91% of patients; 59% demonstrated brainstem involvement. Target dosages ranged from 64.8 and 79.2 (mean 70.7) Co Gy equivalent. The range of follow up was 7 to 75 months (mean 33 months). In 10 patients (17%) the treatment failed locally, resulting in local control rates of 92% (23 of 25 patients) for chondrosarcomas and 76% (25 of 33 patients) for chordomas. Tumor volume and brainstem involvement influenced control rates. All tumors with volumes of 25 ml or less remained locally controlled, compared with 56% of tumors larger than 25 ml (p = 0.02); 94% of patients without brainstem involvement did not experience recurrence; in patients with brainstem involvement (and dose reduction because of brainstem tolerance constraints) the authors achieved a tumor control rate of 53% (p = 0.04). Three patients died of their disease, and one died of intercurrent disease. Actuarial 5-year survival rates were 100% for patients with chondrosarcoma and 79% for patients with chordoma. Grade 3 and 4 late toxicities were observed in four patients (7%) and were symptomatic in three (5%). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose proton RT offers excellent chances of lasting tumor control and survival, with acceptable risks. In this series all small- and medium-sized tumors with no demonstrable brainstem involvement have been controlled; all such patients are alive. Surgical debulking enhanced delivery of full tumoricidal doses, but even patients with large tumors and disease abutting crucial normal structures benefited	
0	1937	Proton radiation therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base. [Review] [35 refs]	Carbon, Chondrosarcoma/mo [Mortality], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Disease Progression, Female, Germany, Humans, Ions, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Rate, Time, United States, Universities	Most patients with conventional radiotherapy after surgery die with local disease progression. The superior local tumor control and overall survival achieved with fractionated proton RT can be attributed to improved dose localization characteristics of protons, resulting in higher doses delivered. Patients with base of skull neoplasms are increasingly considered for stereotactic radiosurgery. Recently, Muthukumar et al reported for the University of Pittsburgh group on cobalt-60 Gamma Knife (Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA) therapy for 15 patients with chordomas or chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. With tumor volumes ranging between 0.98 and 10.3 mL (mean, 4.6 mL), doses to the tumor margin varying from 12 to 20 Gy (median, 18 Gy) were delivered. Two patients were treated without histologic tumor confirmation. After a median follow-up time of 40 months, 2 patients had died of disease, 2 patients had succumbed to intercurrent disease, and 1 patient surviving at the time of analysis had developed tumor progression. Neither actuarial local control nor actuarial survival data were presented. In the LLUMC series, most tumors exceeded sizes reportedly suitable for radiosurgery or were of a highly irregular configuration. Nevertheless, in 11 patients, tumors less than 15 mL in size remained locally controlled as did tumors sized between 15 and 25 mL in 11 additional patients; these patients were thus potential candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery. At present, too few reports on radiosurgery contain sufficient patient numbers and statistical analyses to permit one to draw conclusions about the feasibility of radiosurgery for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. A principal difference between proton RT and radiosurgery as currently practiced in most centers concerns target definition. In proton RT, the GTV is treated. In addition, a clinical volume is defined, which is distinctly different from the GTV in size and shape, to include the operative site and other areas of microscopic risk. In many instances, only the GTV is targeted in radiosurgery. Although it is certainly appropriate to explore the role that radiosurgical techniques may have in treating these tumors, results should be evaluated against the excellent outcome that can be achieved with fractionated proton RT, particularly in patients with tumors small enough and of favorable configuration and location to make them candidates for radiosurgery. The present problem of particle therapy is its limited availability. In the United States, only two proton centers can currently provide treatment for base of skull lesions. The HCL is soon to be replaced by a hospital-based facility at the MGH. Several other proton centers in the United States are currently under active consideration. Proton RT is an evolutionary process. Recent developments in proton RT include intensity modulated therapy and improvements in beam delivery systems, namely, the introduction of active beam scanning. These should further increase the degree of dose conformity. In addition, other heavy particles are also being investigated so as to combine the physical advantages of protons with the differential increased biologic effectiveness of particles in tumor as compared to normal tissues. A report from the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Darmstadt, Germany, has not revealed any increased acute toxicities in the first 13 patients with skull base chordomas or chondrosarcomas treated using carbon ions. Several important factors have emerged from recently published results: Patients with low-grade chondrosarcomas and male patients with chordomas have an excellent chance of durable tumor control and long-term survival after proton RT. Severe complications are within the acceptable range considering the high doses delivered and given the major morbidity associated with uncontrollable tumor growth in such patients. Female patients with chordomas experience increased early and late failures [References: 35]

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma	
1	1939	Fractionated, three-dimensional, planning-assisted proton-radiation therapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: a novel technique	Biopsy, Boston, Child, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hypothalamus, Male, Massachusetts, Optic Chiasm, Orbit, Orbit/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Survivors, Temporal Lobe, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Most children with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma will survive their disease. However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

[Review] [20 refs]	Age Factors, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Neoplasm,Residual, Prognosis, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Sex Factors, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Analysis, United States	Fractionated proton beam radiotherapy has been used for skull base tumors in the United States since the mid-70s, and more than 300 patients in whom diagnosis of chordoma of the skull base has been made have been treated. The ability to achieve high degrees of radiation dose conformity by using protons has resulted in higher radiation doses than can be delivered with conventional radiotherapy in the base of skull. High target volume doses have led to improved tumor control and patient survival. Side effects such as severe toxicity are acceptable considering the alternatives of uncontrolled tumor growth. The authors of various analyses have identified prognostic factors that can be used to predict a patient's chance of treatment success. On the horizon are important technical developments that will further increase dose conformity and increase target doses. In this paper the author reviews long-term outcome data and prognostic predictors for survival of patients with skull base chordomas based on the largest worldwide patient series. [References: 20]

The proximity of both kidneys and the liver, and a more complex target configuration, can pose a dosimetric challenge for conventional X-ray treatment and intraoperative irradiation. We utilized proton radiation therapy (PRT) to reduce dose to uninvolved kidneys, liver, intestine, and spinal cord. PROCEDURE: A 4-year-old male underwent PRT for neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland, following chemotherapy and delayed surgical resection. Clinical target volume (CTV), boost volume, and normal structures were outlined on the 3D treatment planning CT scan. The patient received 25.2 CGE (cobalt Gray equivalent) to the CTV and 34.2 CGE to the boost region, using 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for target and nontarget structures. RESULTS: The 95% isodose volume enclosed CTV and boost volumes. The dose to 50% of the ipsilateral kidney, with tumor involvement of the medial renal surface, was < or = 16 CGE (47% of prescribed total dose). Doses to 50% and 20% of the contralateral kidney in close proximity to deep left-side, paraspinal soft tissue involvement were restricted to 1 CGE and 10 CGE, respectively. Eighty percent of the liver received 27 CGE (80% of prescribed dose). Using a patch technique, unique to charged particle therapy, the spinal cord was almost completely spared during boost volume irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: PRT can achieve excellent dose conformity for advanced retroperitoneal, paraspinal lesions, while respecting normal tissue tolerance levels. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing

Gross total resection with negative margins is rarely achieved, and the risks of functional, structural, and cosmetic deficits limit the radiation dose using conventional radiation techniques. Twenty-nine children and adolescents treated with conformal proton radiotherapy (proton RT) were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome

The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates for all patients were 68% and 44%, respectively. The median time to recurrence was 19 months. Extent of surgery, age, and radiation dose to the posterior fossa all were of prognostic value. Complete or subtotal gross resection appeared to be a favorable prognostic indicator compared with biopsy only (P less than 0.05), with a 69% versus 40% actuarial survival rate at 5 years, respectively. Infants 2 years of age or less had a diminished 5-year actuarial survival rate of 48% (P less than 0.05) compared with older age groups. The posterior fossa was the predominant site of recurrence and accounted for 78% of all failures. Local control in the posterior fossa was dose dependent. Seventy-nine percent of the tumors that received 5000 cGy or greater were controlled versus only 33% of the tumors that received less than 5000 cGy (P less than 0.02). There were no supratentorial failures, and there was only one isolated spinal cord failure. There were no solitary spinal failures in 24 patients who received a median dose of only 2400 cGy to the spinal axis. We concluded that low-dose irradiation to the spine and whole brain may be indicated with maintenance of a posterior fossa dose of greater than 5000 cGy

The patient lies on a low couch and receives exposure in the prone and supine positions from a modulated arcing beam. The technique has been validated using a personal computer to control the linear accelerator and we demonstrate that only minor alterations to current dynamic therapy systems would be required. We have examined the practical application of this treatment with emphasis on methods of conformal therapy where an optimized dose distribution is prepared from a matrix of caliper measurements taken from the patient. This technique provides a means for regular TBI treatment on a computer-controlled linear accelerator that is easy to set up, requires short exposure times and is comfortable for the patient

This study was to observe the abrogation of radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest of p53 mutated human cancer cell lines by 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), and explore the mechanism. METHODS: Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-1 and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line 973, both with p53 mutation, were used in this study. Human fibroblastoma cell line HT-1080 was used as control. Flow cytometry was used to observe the effects of irradiation on cell cycle of these 3 cell lines, and abrogation effect of UCN-01 on radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest. Western blot was used to detect phosphorylated CDC2-Tyr15 during the abrogation process. RESULTS: Irradiation resulted in G(2) phase arrest in CNE-1 cells and 973 cells. Proportion of cells in G(2) phase increased from 18.4% to 43.6% in CNE-1 cell line, and from 14.8% to 42.8% in 973 cell line after 2 Gy of irradiation. G(1) phase arrests, measured by "S phase cells consumption", of CNE-1 cells and 973 cells were much lower than that of HT-1080 cells (14.8% and -1.2% vs. 57.0%). Radiation-induced G(2) phase arrests were abrogated by UCN-01 from 63.5% to 16.1% in CNE-1 cell line, and from 35.4% to 16.3% in 973 cell line. UCN-01 suppressed the expression of radiation-induced phosphorylation of CDC2-Tyr15, which was in accordance with the abrogation of radiation-induced G(2) phase delay. CONCLUSIONS: Main effect of irradiation on cell cycle of p53 mutated CNE-1 cells and 973 cells is G(2) phase arrest. UCN-01 is able to abrogate radiation-induced G(2) phase, which is associated with the reduction of phosphorylated CDC2-Tyr15

This paper discusses the potential of 211At targeted by antibodies for tumor therapy and the possible advantage of 211At over beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides such as 131I currently employed in the field of radioimmunotherapy. Since the longest range alpha-particle from 211At is only 67 microns and the rate of energy loss is high (track averaged linear energy transfer LT approximately 120 keV/micron), a disintegration of 211At produces a large and extremely localized deposition of energy. A Monte-Carlo model has been developed for studying the stochastic fluctuation of alpha-particle hits and energy deposition in cell nuclei in an attempt to determine the efficacy of 211At-labeled antibodies for tumor cell inactivation. Calculations have been performed for 2 extreme conditions: (a) the case of 211At retained in the capillary, and (b) for a homogeneous distribution of 211At-labeled antibody in the tumor. The results of these two calculations represent the boundary conditions between which any real solution must lie. Finally, developments to the model to include antibody transport across the capillary membrane and through the tumor tissue are discussed

0	758	Estimation of the dose to the nursing infant due to direct irradiation from activity present in maternal organs and tissues	Adult, Body Burden, Brazil, Breast, Breast Feeding, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Linear Energy Transfer/ph [Physiology], Liver, Lung, Maternal Exposure, Monte Carlo Method, Organ Specificity, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/an [Analysis], Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Whole-Body Counting/mt [Methods]	Radionuclides deposited internally in the mother will give rise to a radiation dose in the infant in two ways. The radionuclides may be transferred through milk and give rise to an internal dose in the infant, or the radionuclides may emit photons that are absorbed by the infant, giving rise to an external dose. In this paper, the external dose to the newborn infant caused by direct irradiation was estimated for monoenergetic photons. Voxel models (also called voxel phantoms) of the mother and infant were made in three geometries. These models, consisting of volume elements, or voxels, were designed so that the infant model was placed in the lap, at the breast and on the shoulder of the mother model. The Visual Monte Carlo (VMC) code was used to transport the photons through the voxel models. Source regions for the emitted photons, such as the whole body, the thyroid, the lung, the liver and the skeleton, were chosen. For the validation of the calculation procedure, VMC results were favourably compared with the results obtained by using other Monte Carlo programs and also with the previously published results for specific absorbed fractions. This paper provides estimates of the external dose per photon to the infant for photon energies between 0.05 and 2.5 MeV. The external dose per photon estimates were made for the three geometries and for the sources listed above. The results show that, for the geometry of the nursing infant model at the breast, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited in the mother's liver. For the nursing infant model at the shoulder, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited in the mother's thyroid, and for the nursing infant model in the lap, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited uniformly in the whole body. The dose per photon results were then used to estimate the dose an infant might receive over the lactation period (6 months) due to the incorporation of 1 Bq of a radionuclide by the mother. This information may be used to provide external dose estimates to the infant in the case of a known or suspected radionuclide incorporation by the mother due to, for example, a nuclear medicine procedure	
1	1509	Association of rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters in treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer with radiation and hyperthermia	Boston, Confidence Intervals, Digestive System/pa [Pathology], Digestive System/re [Radiation Effects], Heat, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Male, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum/pa [Pathology], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Temperature, Time Factors	PURPOSE: Although hyperthermia has been used for more than two decades in the treatment of pelvic tumors, little is known about the potential impact of heat on rectal toxicity when combined with other treatment modalities. Because rectal toxicity is a concern with radiation and may be exacerbated by hyperthermia, definition of the association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity is important. In this report, we correlate rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters for patients treated with hyperthermia and radiation for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T2b-T3b disease (1992 American Joint Committee On Cancer criteria) enrolled in a Phase II study of external beam radiation +/- androgen-suppressive therapy with two transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia treatments were assessed for rectal toxicity. Prostatic and anterior rectal wall temperatures were monitored for all treatments. Rectal wall temperatures were limited to 40 degrees C in 19 patients, 41 degrees C in 3 patients, and 42 degrees C in 8 patients. Logistic regression was used to estimate the log hazard of developing National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 toxicity based on temperature parameters. The following were calculated: hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, p values for statistical significance of each parameter, and proportion of variability explained for each parameter. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal toxicity was limited to Grade 2. The rate of acute Grade 2 proctitis was greater for patients with an allowable rectal wall temperature of >40 degrees C. In this group, 7 of 11 patients experienced acute Grade 2 proctitis, as opposed to 3 of 19 patients in the group with rectal wall temperatures limited to 40 degrees C (p = 0.004). Preliminary assessment of long-term toxicity revealed no differences in toxicity. Hazard ratios for acute Grade 2 proctitis for allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax were 9.33 (p = 0.01), 3.66 (p = 0.03), and 2.29 (p = 0.08), respectively. A model combining these three parameters explained 48.6% of the variability among groups. CONCLUSION: Rectal toxicity correlates with maximum allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax for patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia combined with radiation for treatment of advanced clinically localized prostate cancer. Further definition of this association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity in treatment of pelvic malignancies with hyperthermia should advance the goal of delivering thermal therapy in an effective yet safe manner

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the records of 74 patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1957 and 1995. The histologic types included squamous cell carcinoma in 6 (8.1%), nonkeratinizing carcinoma in 48 (64.9%), and undifferentiated carcinoma in 20 (27%) cases. The site of recurrence was in the primary in 46 (62.2%), in the neck nodes in 20 (27%), and in both sites in 8 (10.8%) patients. The recurrent disease was Stage I in 10 (13.5%), Stage II in 16 (21.6%), Stage III in 20 (27%), and Stage IV in 28 (37.9%) patients. Thirty-seven (50%) patients developed recurrence within 2 years and 58 (78.4%) within 5 years after initial treatment. Radiotherapeutic techniques used in the retreatment of primary recurrence consisted of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), intracavitary brachytherapy, heavy-charged particle beam, and gamma knife, alone or in combination. Reirradiation doses ranged from 18 to 108 Gy, with a median dose of 60 Gy. Treatment of recurrent neck nodes consisted of radical neck dissection (RND) +/- intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), or EBRT +/- hyperthermia, or chemotherapy +/- hyperthermia. Chemotherapy was used in 22 (30%) patients. Median follow-up was 20 months (range: 2 to 308 months). RESULTS: The 3-, 5-, and 10-year actuarial overall survival following retreatment were 49, 37, 18%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (49%) were free of further local-regional recurrence after retreatment. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year local-regional progression-free rates were 52, 40, and 38%, respectively. On univariate analysis, histologic type (p < 0.0001), interval to recurrence (p = 0.034), and treatment modality for early-stage disease (p = 0.01) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival, with age being marginally significant (p = 0.053). For local-regional progression-free rate, only histology was significant (p = 0.035). On multivariate analysis, age (p = 0.026), histology (p = 0.015), and interval to recurrence (p = 0.030) were significant for overall survival, and only histology (p = 0.002) and presence of complications (p = 0.016) were significant for local-regional progression-free rate. Of the 64 reirradiated patients, late complications were documented in 29 (45%) patients. The late complications were permanent in 21 (33%) and severe in 15 (23%) patients. CONCLUSION: Retreatment using radiotherapy alone or in combination with other treatment modalities can achieve long-term local-regional control and survival in a substantial proportion of patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Age, histology, and interval to recurrence were independent prognostic factors for overall survival, but only histology and presence of complications were significant for local-regional progression-free rate

By maximizing the probability of achieving tumor control without causing severe complications electron beam fluence profiles have been optimized for superficial target volumes. It is possible to use several equiportal fluence-modulated electron beams to modify the energy deposition with depth in a controlled manner making it possible to use the technique as an alternative to bolus. The technique was tested in two representative phantom geometries and in three clinical patient geometries using a set of five and two different energies. The local maxima in dose for the plans with five energies were typically lower than with the conventional or advanced bolus techniques. The principles for how the technique could be carried out in the future with a fourth generation radiotherapy accelerator are also indicated

[Russian]	Adolescent, Adult, Arteriovenous Fistula/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Cerebral Arteries, Cerebral Veins, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Protons, Retrospective Studies, Stereotaxic Techniques	The paper is concerned with analysis of angiographic findings on 62 patients with arteriovenous aneurysms (AVA) of the cerebral vessels who received proton beam stereotactic therapy in the period of 1978-1986 depending on an absorbed dose value of an irradiated volume. Proton stereotactic therapy (PST) of brain AVA located deep in the functionally important regions, can be used as an independent radical therapeutic method in such cases including inoperable ones. Complete AVA elimination from the blood flow or considerable reduction of the AVA volume was achieved in 68% of the patients after delivering a dose of approximately 40 Gy, the AVA volume being approximately 30%. Significant (p less than 0.05) correlation of PST results, a dose of irradiation and a value of the AVA irradiated volume was established in the groups with positive results and in the nonresponding groups

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with skull base chordoma who were treated with proton beams with or without X-rays at the University of Tsukuba between 1989 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A median total tumor dose of 72.0 Gy (range, 63.0-95.0 Gy) was delivered. The patients were followed for a median period of 69.3 months (range, 14.6-123.4 months). RESULTS: The 5-year local control rate was 46.0%. Cause-specific, overall, and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 72.2%, 66.7%, and 42.2%, respectively. The local control rate was higher, without statistical significance, for those with preoperative tumors <30 mL. Partial or subtotal tumor removal did not yield better local control rates than for patients who underwent biopsy only as the latest surgery. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is effective for patients with skull base chordoma, especially for those with small tumors. For a patient with a tumor of <30 mL with no prior treatment, biopsy without tumor removal seems to be appropriate before proton beam therapy. [References: 38]	
1	519	Sequential evaluation of hepatic functional reserve by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin scintigraphy after proton beam therapy: a report of three cases and a review of the literatures.

In this report, we present three patients with malignant liver tumors treated by proton beam therapy in whom pre- and post-therapeutic hepatic functional reserves were evaluated sequentially for more than a year by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. All three patients exhibited the distinctive time course of 99mTc-GSA uptake efficiency, which suggested a transient decline in the ratio of liver activity to heart and liver activity at 15 minutes (LHL15) 3-6 months after proton beam therapy. This change was not in parallel with that expected from a functioning normal liver tissue volume. In a year after proton beam therapy, LHL15 recovered nearly to the pre-treatment level in all three patients. Our observations may be related to the up-regulation of receptor-mediated 99mTc-GSA uptake during hepatic regeneration after proton beam therapy. [References: 27]

The advent of localized proton spectroscopy has made this detection possible. The spectral peak intensities were found to be very different depending on tumor tissue pathology. METHODS: The tumor cell reaction after radiation therapy was examined with proton localized spectroscopy in addition to enhanced MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips, Gyroscan S15-HP). Plain MR images (short spin echo) were used for localization pilot images, and after the MRS study, contrast enhanced MRI was carried out. Studies were performed pre-radiation, mid-radiation, and post-radiation if possible. MATERIALS: Sixteen patients (total 27 examinations) with intracranial tumors and three normal volunteers underwent proton NMR localized spectroscopy. The brain tumors were diagnosed before the MR study, and nine patients had metastatic brain tumors, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, and seven other patients were diagnosed with glioma-type tumors. RESULTS: The reaction patterns of proton NMR spectroscopy of brain tumors after radiation therapy were very different and depended on tumor histology. CONCLUSION: Proton NMR spectroscopy is an excellent means of determining tumor cell viability

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of 30 patients with unresectable sacral chordomas treated with carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan. Twenty-three patients presented with no prior treatment, and the remaining 7 patients had locally recurrent disease following previous surgical resection. The median clinical target volume was 546 cm(3). The applied carbon ion dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 GyE (gray equivalent, median 70.4) in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 9 to 87 months), 26 patients were still alive and 24 patients remained continuously disease-free. Overall and cause-specific survival rates at 5 years were 52 and 94%, respectively. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 96%. Two patients experienced severe skin/soft tissue complications requiring skin grafts. No other treatment-related surgical interventions, including colostomy or urinary diversion, were carried out. All patients have remained ambulatory and able to stay at home after carbon ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy is effective and safe in the management of patients with unresectable sacral chordomas and offers a promising alternative to surgery

The prognosis of unresectable/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma remains very poor because the rarity of the tumor has made it difficult to establish treatment guidelines, and diagnosis and the resultant treatment can be greatly delayed. We treated a 24-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma of the right adrenal gland which extended to the inferior vena cava. Although she underwent surgical resection of the extensive tumor as the primary treatment, the disease recurred in the lung and liver as multiple metastases shortly after surgery. She received intensive multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP regimen), embolization of the feeding arteries, and proton irradiation for the liver mass. Finally, she underwent reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA 1-locus-mismatched sibling donor. A prolonged survival of 39 months after the onset of the disease was achieved. Although this experience is limited, we suggest that TIP chemotherapy was effective for adrenocortical carcinoma, and a graft-versus-tumor effect after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation may have contributed to the prolonged survival

The output timing signal from the system is transferred to the proton accelerator for synchronized irradiation. The timing signal is set during the expiratory phase at a duration of 1.5 to 2 seconds. The efficacy of this method was evaluated by dose volume histogram based on the treatment planning program with CT images. The volume spared by this novel method was calculated in several cases, and results suggest that the method was highly effective

In such patients, breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by breast irradiation is generally considered contraindicated owing to the high cumulative radiation dose. Mastectomy is therefore recommended as the first option treatment in these women. METHODS: Six patients affected by early breast cancer previously treated with mantle radiation for HD underwent BCS associated with full-dose intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT). RESULTS: A total dose of 21 Gy (prescribed at 90% isodose) in five cases and 17 Gy (at 100% isodose) in one case were delivered directly to the mammary gland without acute complications and with good cosmetic results. After an average of 30.8 months of follow up, no late sequelae were observed and the patients are free of disease. CONCLUSION: In patients previously irradiated for HD, ELIOT can avoid repeat irradiation of the whole breast, permit BCS and decrease the number of avoidable mastectomies	
1	3108	Comparative treatment planning between proton and X-ray therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	Aged, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, Risk, Sweden, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage X-rays and protons for medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of X-rays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord	
1	136	Comparative treatment planning between proton and x-ray therapy in esophageal cancer	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage x-rays and protons for five patients with esophageal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of x-rays. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, a Phase II clinical trial of C-ion RT with a total dose of 66 GyE in 20 fractions was performed on 175 patients with prostate cancer, and the correlations of clinical and dosimetric parameters with the incidence of late GI toxicity in 172 patients who survived for more than 18 months were investigated. RESULTS: Although no Grade 3-4 late morbidities of the rectum were observed, Grade 1 and 2 morbidities developed in 23 (13%) and 4 (2%) patients, respectively. Dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the percentage of rectal volume receiving 50% of the prescribed dose (V50) was significantly higher in patients with rectal toxicity than without toxicity (13.2 +/- 5.6% with toxicity; 11.4 +/- 4.0% without toxicity, p = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.010) and rectal V50 (p = 0.012) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of Grade 1-2 late GI toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although C-ion RT with hypofractionation yielded favorable results regarding late GI complication, dosimetric parameter was a very important factor in the occurrence of rectal bleeding after C-ion RT as well as photon beam RT. Our results provide useful information for physicians applying charged particle RT in the treatment of prostate cancer

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, 175 patients received C-ion RT using a recommended dose fractionation (66.0 GyE/20 fractions) established from prior studies. C-ion RT alone was performed for 33 patients constituting a low-risk group (Stage < or =T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml and Gleason score < or =6); the remaining 142 high-risk patients received an additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and bNED rates were 91% and 87%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all but one patient. The 4-year bNED rates were 87% in the low-risk group and 88% in the high-risk group. In very advanced diseases (Stage > or= T3a or PSA > or= 20 ng/ml or Gleason score > or =8), there was significant difference in the bNED rate according to period of ADT administration (ADT > or =24 months: 93%, ADT <24 months: 73%, p<0.01). Grade 2 late toxicities developed in 4 patients (2%) for the rectum and 9 patients (5%) for the genitourinary system but no Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of C-ion RT for prostate cancer has been well confirmed. Based on these results, new study of a C-ion RT modified for the administration strategy of ADT according to the patient risk has been started by dividing patients into 3 groups, high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk

C-ion beams have a high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) resulting from the high linear energy transfer (LET). In terms of their physical characteristics, C-ion beams exhibit a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and make for a better dose distribution of the target volume by specified beam modulations. Between June 1994 and August 2005, a total of 2,371 patients with malignant tumors were registered in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II trials using C-ion beams generated at Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). In the initial dose-escalation studies, grade 3 or more late rectal complications had developed in some patients. However, the adverse effects were resolved because of the use of appropriate dose levels and modification of the radiation technique. C-ion beams can carry out hypofractionated radiotherapy with a large fraction dose and reduce the overall treatment times compared with conventional radiotherapy. They can also achieve better local tumor control even for radio-resistant tumors such as malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and bone and soft tissue sarcomas with minimal morbidity to the normal surrounding tissues.

First, we determined steady-state activity ratios of 232Th progeny from 13 autopsy cases and found them to be identical to those reported in German subjects. Second, we estimated the alpha dose rates in 206 subjects at autopsy from radioactivity measurements and terminal weights of the organs. Combining these results with measurements of exhaled 220Rn in survivors, we considered the representative dose rates at injection to be 0.22 Gy y-1. Additionally, our data suggest that deposition in the spleen has previously been overestimated. This is an error with some bearing on the evaluation of leukemia risks from alpha-particle irradiation

One patient had both cerebral andmyocardial infarcts and died at age 25 years. Necropsy disclosed both adventitial and intimal fibrosis of the left carotid artery and greater than 75 per cent cross-sectional area luminal narrowing of both the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries. The other patient, a 33 year old man, had no cerebral symptoms in life but total obstruction of the right carotid artery secondary to a thorotrastoma was found at necropsy. Vascular complications due to thorotrast appear to represent consequences of chronic alpha irradiation

Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages

On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

There is a lack of effective treatments for individuals with advanced disease. Many melanomas exhibit high levels of radioresistance. The direct consequence of gamma-irradiation for most melanoma cells is growth arrest at the G2-M phase of cell cycle. However, radiation-induced signaling pathways may affect numerous additional targets in cancer cells. We show in the present study that gamma-irradiation, as well as alpha-particle exposure, dramatically increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface TRAIL-receptor 1/receptor 2 (DR4/DR5) levels and to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface Fas levels. Additionally, increased dynamin-2 expression after irradiation is critically important in the translocation of death receptor to the cell surface. Moreover, sodium arsenite treatment may up-regulate expression of endogenous TRAIL and induces its translocation to cell surface and further down-regulates cFLIP levels in melanoma cells. We have evaluated the effects of sequential gamma-irradiation and arsenite treatment of melanoma cells for the induction of death signaling. Such treatment results in an efficient TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via a paracrine mechanism. These data highlight the efficacy of combined modality treatment involving radiation and arsenite in clinical management of this often fatal form of skin cancer

The study of tumors attributable to high LET irradiation would greatly augment our insights into the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Chronic low-dose-rate internal exposure to alpha-radiation from thorium dioxide deposits following intravascular administration of the radiographic contrast agent Thorotrast is known to markedly increase the risk of cancer development, especially that of hepatic angiosarcomas and cholangiocarcinomas. Although the mechanism is hypothesized to be via cellular damage, DNA being a major target, wrought by the high LET alpha-particles, the specific genes and the actual sequence of events involved in the process of transforming a normal cell into a malignant one are largely unknown. To shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of cancer development during a lifetime exposure to alpha-radiation, we analyzed the most commonly affected tumor suppressor gene in humans, p53, in 20 Thorotrast recipients who developed cancer, mostly of hepatic bile duct and blood vessel origin. Of the 20 cases, 19 were found to harbor p53 point mutations. Moreover, the accompanying non-tumor tissues from these patients also had p53 mutations, albeit at lower frequency. The distribution pattern of the point mutations was significantly different between the non-tumor and tumor tissues, with most mutations in malignant tissues located in the highly conserved domains of the p53 gene. Our results support the idea that p53 mutations are important in the genesis of Thorotrast-induced tumors but that these point mutations are a secondary outcome of genomic instability induced by the irradiation. Additionally, non-tumor cells harboring p53 mutations may gain some survival advantage in situ but mutations in the domains responsible for the formation of structural elements critical in binding DNA may be necessary for a cell to reach full malignancy

Moderate to severe losses were noted in patients producing voice with all types of alaryngeal modalities: tracheoesophageal, esophageal, and electrolaryngeal. Voice and speech losses were related to the impaired motility and vibratory capability of the esophageal wall and mucosa, to fibrosis of the submandibular region and to trismus. Tracheoesophageal and esophageal voice was recovered some weeks after completion of irradiation. No voice losses were observed in alaryngeal speakers who did not undergo voice restoration until after irradiation. All irradiated patients also showed various degrees of dysphagia during the treatment

The in-vivo MR spectra of malignant breast tissue of patients (n = 67) suffering from infiltrating ductal carcinoma are dominated by the water resonance, while the spectra of the unaffected contralateral breast tissue of these patients are mainly dominated by resonance arising from lipids which is similar to the spectra of normal breast tissue obtained from volunteers (controls, n = 16). In addition to the water and lipid peaks, in majority of the patients (approximately 80%) the water suppressed spectra showed a resonance at 3.2 ppm due to choline containing compounds (TCho) before treatment. In patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, absence/reduction in choline was observed in 89% of the patients. TCho was also observed in 2 of 14 benign lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of in-vivo MRS in detecting TCho in malignant tumours was 78% and 86%, respectively. Observation of TCho before treatment and its disappearance (or reduction) after treatment may be a useful indicator of response of locally advanced breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

First, an analysis of treatment angle combinations for 50 patients treated with conventional conformal radiation therapy is performed. In a second step, nine treatment plans for a hypothetical heavy ion gantry were prepared. Finally, cylindrical projections of the organs at risk are introduced as a tool to analyse the distribution of treatment angles as well as the treatment geometry for each patient. The results of the analysis for conventional therapy clearly show treatment angle combinations that are preferably used. These findings are also supported by the geometrical analysis using the cylindrical projections. The majority of treatment angles for heavy ions also seem to be confined to those regions. In one case, however, the sharp distal dose fall-off of the heavy ions allowed a beam direction outside these conventionally used regions. The advantages of a heavy ion gantry versus a fixed horizontal beam line are shown by comparison of treatment plans for both systems. Treatment angle combinations are suggested that should be accessible for any beam line design using either fixed beams or a gantry

All treatment plans are evaluated on the basis of biologically effective dose distributions. For therapy control, in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) and an online monitoring system for the beam intensity and position are used. The absence of a gantry restricts the treatment plans to horizontal beams. Most of the treatment plans consist of two nearly opposing lateral fields or sometimes orthogonal fields. In only a very few cases a single beam was used. For patients with very complex target volumes lateral and even distal field patching techniques were applied. Additional improvements can be achieved when the patient's head is fixed in a tilted position, in order to achieve sparing of the organs at risk. In order to test the stability of dose distributions in the case of patient misalignments we routinely simulate the effects of misalignments for patients with critical structures next to the target volume. The uncertainties in the range calculation are taken into account by a margin around the target volume of typically 2-3 mm, which can, however, be extended if the simulation demonstrates larger deviations. The novel TPS developed for scanned ion beams was introduced into clinical routine in December 1997 and was used for the treatment planning of 63 patients with head and neck tumours until July 2000. Planning strategies and methods were developed for this tumour location that facilitate the treatment of a larger number of patients with the scanned heavy ion beam in a clinical setting. Further developments aim towards a simultaneous optimization of the treatment field intensities and more effective procedures for the patient set-up. The results demonstrate that ion beams can be integrated into a clinical environment for treatment planning and delivery	
1	354	On the cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiation therapy for skull base chordoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary treatment costs and costs for recurrent tumors are estimated. The costs for treatment of recurrent tumors were estimated using a sample of 10 patients presenting with recurrent chordoma at the base of skull at DKFZ. Using various scenarios for the local control rate and reimbursements of Carbon ion therapy the cost-effectiveness of ion therapy for these tumors is analyzed. RESULTS: If local control rate for skull base chordoma achieved with carbon ion therapy exceeds 70.3%, the overall treatment costs for carbon RT are lower than for conventional RTI. The cost-effectiveness ratio for carbon RT is 2539 Euro per 1% increase in survival, or 7692 Euro per additional life year. CONCLUSION: Current results support the thesis that Carbon ion RT, although more expensive, is at least as cost-effective as advanced photon therapies for these patients. Ion RT, however, offers substantial benefits for the patients such as improved control rates and less severe side effects. [References: 18]

The ranges along various beam paths including artefacts were calculated from the TPS and compared to known calculations for phantoms without any insert. In the head phantom, beams intersecting the streak artefacts lead to errors in the range of around or below 1%, which is mainly due to a cancellation of various effects. Beams through the metal or close to it show an underestimation of 3.5% of the range for tungsten. For the pelvic phantom, a large underestimation of the range is observed for a lateral path through the metal insert. In the case of tungsten and steel, range errors of -5% and -18% are observed, respectively. Such beam paths are typically used for pelvic tumours in radiotherapy with ion beams. For beams in the anterior-posterior direction through the inserts, an overestimation of ion ranges of up to 3% for titanium and 8% for steel is expected, respectively. Beam paths outside the metal insert show a large cancellation for the lateral beams (leading to errors of around 1% only) and somewhat higher errors for anterior-posterior beams (around 3% for titanium and 6% for steel). The analysis of CT data of patients with dental implants of gold as compared to patients with healthy teeth also showed a significant effect of the artefacts on the distribution of HU in the data, namely a redistribution of HU to higher and lower values as compared to patients with healthy teeth. The corresponding mean range variation was a 2.5% reduction in the data with artefacts as compared to the data without artefacts. It is concluded that beam paths through metal implants should generally be avoided in proton and ion therapy. In this case, the underestimation of ion range due to artefacts alone may amount to 3% for dental fillings and up to 5% and 18% for hip prosthesis made of titanium and steel, respectively. It is important to note that the size of the metal inserts cannot be determined correctly from the images, so that a correction of the ranges in metal also leads to large uncertainties. Finally, it should be stressed that the stated relative deviations are strictly valid only for the investigated phantoms and can only give a rough estimate on the size of range uncertainties that may appear in real patients

This inhomogeneous spatial distribution of lesions can be visualized indirectly and rapidly in the form of radiation-induced foci using immunocytochemical detection or GFP-tagged DNA repair proteins. To analyze faster protein translocations and a possible contribution of radiation-induced chromatin movement in DNA damage recognition in live cells, we developed a remote-controlled system to obtain high-resolution fluorescence images of living cells during ion irradiation with a frame rate of the order of seconds. Using scratch replication labeling, only minor chromatin movement at sites of ion traversal was observed within the first few minutes of impact. Furthermore, time-lapse images of the GFP-coupled DNA repair protein aprataxin revealed accumulations within seconds at sites of ion hits, indicating a very fast recruitment to damaged sites. Repositioning of the irradiated cells after fixation allowed the comparison of live cell observation with immunocytochemical staining and retrospective etching of ion tracks. These results demonstrate that heavy-ion radiation-induced changes in subnuclear structures can be used to determine the kinetics of early protein recruitment in living cells and that the changes are not dependent on large-scale chromatin movement at short times postirradiation

The melanomas measured 7 to 15 mm at the tumor base and 2 t0 5 mm thick. First, photocoagulation using the green argon laser was aimed at closing the choroidal vascular supply of the tumor. In a second stage, tumor tissue was destroyed using the red krypton laser for confluent burns of long duration. Such treatment was supplemented by cryotherapy in peripherally located tumors or whenever photocoagulation alone did not result in tumor regression. Photocoagulation alone was used in ten eyes and combined wih cryotherapy in seven. After an average follow-up of 42 months, marked tumor regression was achieved in 12 eyes and some tumor regression in two. Tow eyes ultimately required proton beam irradiation, and one eye was enucleated. No metastasis occurred during follow-up

Post mortem two tumours were found in an enlarged liver: a cholangiocarcinoma and an angiosarcoma. Coincidentally, a hilar neurofibroma was found. The former two tumours most probably developed because of a lifelong endogenous alpha-irradiation by thorium disintegration. The exceptional latency period of 60 years' duration is emphasized

The last technique, though very expensive, provides improved dose distributions and dose localizations in the treatment of tumours adjacent to critical normal tissues. The technique of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is now being used at an increasingly large number of centers in the treatment of lesions in the brain, and the head and neck. This article describes the successful extension of the stereotactic technique to the treatment of ocular melanoma: an eye fixation aid is attached to a noninvasive, relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame together with a simple eye-movement tracking system. 2003 American College of Medical Physics

This paper describes the results of our attempt to demonstrate short-term changes associated with normal brain during and immediately following radiotherapy when the whole brain is irradiated for malignant conditions. No observable changes were found in the normal brain parenchyma in any of the patients (n = 8) in T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted images in the sequential scans in the first and second weeks and immediately following radiotherapy. Also, no changes were observed in the normal brain appearance at 2 mo (n = 6), up to 6 mo (n = 1), and up to 15 mo (n = 1) after completion of radiotherapy

Sometimes it is not possible either clinically or histologically to differentiate between a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and benign lymphoid hyperplasia. A series of 24 patients is reported. Nineteen were classified as having malignant NHL and 5 benign hyperplasia; 1 of these 5 later developed metastases, however. All patients had systemic work-up: 18 had Stage I, 1 had Stage II, and 5 had Stage IV disease. All patients received local radiation therapy with doses of 2400 to 2750 rad in 2-3 weeks for lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva, and between 3000 and 3750 rad in 3-4 weeks for retrobulbar lesions. The lens was shielded in all patients except in 2 who had NHL of the vitreous body. A method of shielding the lens with a lead block mounted on a "low vac lens" is described, and the dose distribution within the eye and orbit is presented. The dose to the ocular lens is reduced to about 10% of the tumor dose with this technique. Patients who were treated with doses higher than 3000 rad experienced conjunctivitis and skin erythema that resolved completely. No other effects of radiation on normal structures of the ocular adnexa were observed in the 20 patients who are alive and without signs of tumor 10-46 months with a median follow-up time of 22 months

These reactions may have acute or late character, may affect all structures of the hearing organ, and result in conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. Up to 40% of patients have acute middle ear side effects during radical irradiation including acoustic structures and about one-third of patients develop late sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Total radiotherapy dose and tumour site seem to be among the most important factors associated with the risk of hearing impairment. Thus, reduction in radiation dose to the auditory structures should be attempted whenever possible. New radiotherapy techniques (3-dimensional conformal irradiation, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) allow better dose distribution with lower dose to the non-target organs. Treatment of acute and late external otitis is mainly conservative and includes the anti-inflammatory agents (applied topically and systematically). Post-radiation chronic otitis media and the eustachian tube pathology may be managed with tympanic membrane incision with insertion of a tympanostomy tube (grommet), although the benefit of such approach is controversial and some authors advocate a more conservative approach. In these patients the functional deficit can be alleviated by application of bone conduction hearing aids such as, e.g., the bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA). There is no standard therapy for post-irradiation sudden or progressive SNHL yet corticosteroid therapy, rheologic medications, hyperbaric oxygen or carbogen therapy are usually employed (as for idiopathic SNHL), although controversial data on the efficacy of these treatment modalities have been published. In selected cases with bilateral profound hearing loss or total deafness, cochlear implants may prove effective. Further improvements in radiotherapy techniques and progress in otologic diagnostics and therapy may allow better prevention and management of radiation-related acoustic injury. [References: 126]

Our aim was to review the potential benefits and available clinical experience of particle beam therapy (hadrontherapy) in the treatment of these tumors. METHODS: A review of the literature was carried out through a MEDLINE search (publications between 1980 and 2005). RESULTS: A review of the available clinical data shows that particle beam therapy can offer several radiobiological and physical advantages over conventional photon radiotherapy: improved dose distribution permits dose escalation within the target and optimal sparing of normal tissue. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits to using hadrontherapy for tumors characterized by poor radiosensitivity and critical location. At present, the most used hadrons are protons and, as yet on an experimental basis, carbon ions. It is now well accepted that there are certain indications for using proton therapy for skull base tumors (chordoma and chondrosarcoma), paranasal sinus carcinomas, selected nasopharyngeal tumors, and neutron/ion therapy for salivary gland carcinomas (in particular, adenoid cystic tumors). Its viability in other cases, such as locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and bone sarcoma, is still under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Hadrontherapy can be beneficial in the treatment of tumors characterized by poor radiosensitivity and critical location. Further clinical and radiobiological studies are warranted for improved selection of patient population. [References: 80]

In the case of proton therapy, secondary neutrons generated in the accelerator head and inside the patient reach many areas in the patient body. Due to the improved efficacy of management of cancer patients, the number of long term survivors post-radiation treatment is increasing substantially. This results in concern about the risk of radiation-induced cancer appearing at late post-treatment times. This paper presents a case study to determine the effective dose from secondary neutrons in patients undergoing proton treatment. A whole-body patient model, VIP-Man, was employed as the patient model. The geometry dataset generated from studies made on VIP-Man was implemented into the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code. Two proton treatment plans for tumours in the lung and paranasal sinus were simulated. The organ doses and ICRP-60 radiation and tissue weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. Results show whole body effective doses for the two proton plans of 0.162 Sv and 0.0266 Sv, respectively, to which the major contributor is due to neutrons from the proton treatment nozzle. There is a substantial difference among organs depending on the treatment site

We have experimentally investigated the intra-fractional organ motion effects in lung IMRT treatments delivered by multi-leaf collimator (MLC). An in-house made motor-driven platform, which moves sinusoidally with an amplitude of 1 cm and a period of 4 s, was used to mimic tumour motion. Tumour motion was simulated along cranial-caudal direction while MLC leaves moved across the patient from left to right, as in most clinical cases. The dose to a point near the centre of the tumour mass was measured according to geometric and dosimetric parameters from two five-field lung IMRT plans. For each field, measurement was done for two dose rates (300 and 500 MU min(-1)), three MLC delivery modes (sliding window, step-and-shoot with 10 and 20 intensity levels) and eight equally spaced starting phases of tumour motion. The dose to the measurement point delivered from all five fields was derived for both a single fraction and 30 fractions by randomly sampling from measured dose values of each field at different initial phases. It was found that the mean dose to a moving tumour differs slightly (<2-3%) from that to a static tumour. The variation in breathing phase at the start of dose delivery results in a maximum variation around the mean dose of greater than 30% for one field. The full width at half maximum for the probability distribution of the point dose is up to 8% for all five fields in a single fraction, but less than 1-2% after 30 fractions. In general, lower dose rate can reduce the motion-caused dose variation and therefore might be preferable for lung IMRT when no motion mitigation techniques are used. From the two IMRT cases we studied where tumour motion is perpendicular to MLC leaf motion, the dose variation was found to be insensitive to the MLC delivery mode

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In prostate cancer it is estimated that annually about 300 patients and in gynaecological cancer about 50 patients, are candidates for proton beam therapy. Owing to major uncertainties, it has not been possible to give an estimate of the number of potential patients with urinary bladder cancer. [References: 61]

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT

RT consisted of 3600 to 4500 cGy external pelvic treatments on a 6-MeV linear accelerator followed by two intracavitary applications administering a total of 4000 mg hr of radium equivalent cesium. CT consisted of a course of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 iv bolus) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU; 1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the second week of external RT and another course of cis-platinum (CDDP; 75 mg/m2, 1-6 hr infusion) and 5FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the first intracavitary cesium application. Toxicity was acceptable and complete clinical response was obtained in all patients at the end of the regimen. Nine patients are alive (eight without disease) 6 to 37 months following initiation of treatment (median 20 months). One patient has developed lumbar spine bone metastases and another died of local and pulmonary disease at 28 months. This combination of 5FU/mitomycin C/CDDP and RT appears to be a practical, well-tolerated, and highly effective regimen for advanced cervical carcinoma

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Models of dynamic changes in cell number with time were used to develop a function for the remission time (T(rem)) after palliative radiotherapy: [See Equation], where BED is the biologically effective dose, t(1) the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of radiotherapy), K the daily BED repopulation equivalent, alpha the linear radiosensitivity parameter in the linear-quadratic model, and z the tumor regression rate. RESULTS: Simulations of clinical trials show marked variations in remission statistics depending on the tumor characteristics and are highly compatible with the results of clinical trials. Dose escalation produces both a higher proportion and extended duration of remissions, especially in tumors with high alpha/beta ratios and K values, but the predicted dose responses of acute and late side effects show that caution is necessary. The prospect of using particle beam therapy to reduce normal tissue radiation exposures or using hypoxic sensitizers to improve the tumor cell kill might significantly improve the results of palliative radiotherapy in carefully selected patients and could also be used for safer palliative re-treatments in patients with the potential for prolonged survival. The effect of tumor heterogeneity in determining palliative responses probably exceeds that in radical radiotherapy; as few as 100 patients in each treatment arm produce statistically unreliable results. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual trials of palliative radiotherapy can be useful to test the effects of competing schedules and better determine future strategies, including improved design of clinical trials as well as combinations of radiotherapy with other anticancer modalities

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The biologic effective dose concept is used to estimate the alpha/beta ratio and K (dose equivalent for tumor repopulation/d) for high-grade glioma patients treated in a randomized fractionation trial. The equivalent radiation dose of temozolomide (Temodar) chemotherapy was estimated from another randomized study. The method assumes that the radiotherapy biologic effective dose is proportional to the adjusted radiotherapy survival duration of high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS: The median tumor alpha/beta and K estimate is 9.32 Gy and 0.23 Gy/d, respectively. Using the published surviving fraction after 2-Gy exposure (SF2) data, and the above alpha/beta ratio, the estimated median alpha value was 0.077 Gy(-1), beta was 0.009 Gy(-2), and the cellular doubling time was 39.5 days. The median equivalent biologic effective dose of temozolomide was 11.03 Gy(9.3) (equivalent to a radiation dose of 9.1 Gy given in 2-Gy fractions). Random sampling trial simulations based on a cure threshold of 70 Gy in high-grade gliomas have shown the potential increase in tumor cure with dose escalation. Partial elimination of hypoxic cells (by chemical hypoxic cell sensitizers or carbon ion therapy) has suggested that considerable gains in tumor control, which are further supplemented by temozolomide, are achievable. CONCLUSION: The radiobiologic parameters for human high-grade gliomas can be estimated from clinical trials and could be used to inform future clinical trials, particularly combined modality treatments with newer forms of radiotherapy.

Between September 1988 and December 1997 a total of 973 patients (26,916 fields) had been treated on the 66 MeV p+Be isocentric neutron therapy system. Patients are currently being treated according to several protocols, including tumors of the head and neck, salivary gland and breast and soft tissue sarcomas, uterine sarcomas and paranasal sinuses. A multiblade post-collimator trimmer has recently being installed. This device provides improved neutron beam shaping capability. Between September 1993 and December 1997 a total of 243 patients (4008 fields) had been treated (mainly intracranial stereotactic irradiations) on the fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton therapy facility. The facility incorporates an innovative automatic patient positioning system. Two new fixed beam lines for proton therapy are presently being designed (horizontal and 30 degrees to the vertical) for an existing unused treatment vault. Spot scanning systems will be developed for both beam lines

The optimum time to use this modality for palliation of symptoms is unclear. Our department treated 44 evaluable patients with upper and lower halfbody radiation. Stratification according to a modified Karnofsky performance scale revealed an 86% response with a notable increase in median duration of survival in those patients exhibiting an initial performance scale of -1. The optimum benefit from halfbody irradiation is derived when administered at the earliest indicated time

The higher uptake by lymphomas of 67Gallium (67Ga) compared with monoclonal antibodies makes selective radiotherapy by the widely available 67Ga appealing. However, the gamma radiation of 67Ga used in scintigraphy is considered to be almost non-toxic to lymphoma cells. However, in addition to photon radiation 67Ga emits low energy Auger electrons and 80-90 keV conversion electrons which could be cytotoxic. The objective of the present study was the assessment of radiotoxicity of 67Ga on a lymphoid cell line: U937. Proliferation (MTT-assay) and clonogenic capacity (CFU-assay) were measured after 3 and 6 days incubation with 10, 20 and 40 microCi ml-1 67Ga. Growth inhibition was 36% after 3 days incubation and 63% after 6 days incubation with 40 microCi 67Ga ml-1. Clonogenic capacity was reduced by 51% after 3 days and 72% after 6 days incubation with 40 microCi ml-1 67Ga. A survival curve showed an initial shoulder and became steeper beyond 200-250 pCi cell-1 (low linear energy transfer type). Iso-effect doses of 67Ga and 90Yttrium (90Y) were determined. The iso-effect dose of 40 microCi 67Ga ml-1 (cumulative dose of conversion electrons 306 cGy) was 2.5 microCi 90Y ml-1 (cumulative dose 494 cGy) and the iso-effect dose of 80 microCi 67Ga ml-1 was 5.0 microCi 90Y/ml. The main cytotoxic effect of 67Ga seems to be induced by the 80 keV conversion electrons. We conclude that the conversion electrons of 67Ga have a cytotoxic effect on U937 cells and that in our experiments a 16-fold higher microCi-dose of 67Ga than of 90Y was needed for the same cytotoxic effect. We believe that 67Ga holds promise for therapeutic use

The unfavorable prognosis of this type of cancer was improved by a combined treatment, consisting of surgical tumor reduction and implantation of a transhepatic drainage, followed by external radiation and intracatheter brachytherapy. Nine patients were treated in this manner, seven died 6-67 months after operation, two are still alive 7 and 13 months postoperatively

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1989 and December 1993, 120 consecutive patients underwent linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery, and univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median survival time was 32 weeks. Progressive brain metastases, both local and regional, caused 25 of 104 deaths. Patients with two metastases (n = 30) or a solitary metastasis (n = 70) had equivalent actuarial survival times (P = .07; median, 37 weeks; maximum, 211+ weeks). Patients treated to three or more metastases (n = 20) had significantly shorter survival times (P < .002; median, 14 weeks; maximum, 63 weeks). Prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival included a pretreatment Karnofsky performance status > or = 70% and fewer than three metastases. Delayed radiation necrosis at the treated site developed in 20 patients and correlated with prior or concurrent delivery of whole-brain irradiation and the logarithm of the tumor volume. CONCLUSION: Survival duration is equivalent for patients with one or two brain metastases and is similar to that reported for patients with a solitary metastasis managed by surgical resection and whole-brain irradiation. Survival after radiosurgery for three or more metastases was similar to that reported for whole-brain irradiation	
0	3163	Genetic, cytogenetic, and carcinogenic effects of radon: a review. [Review] [87 refs]	Animals, Chromosome Aberrations, DNA, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Environment, Humans, Lung, Mutagenesis, Mutagenesis/re [Radiation Effects], Mutation, Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Neoplasms/ge [Genetics], Radon, Radon/ae [Adverse Effects], Rats, Research, Risk, Smoking, Time, Uranium	Radon exposure has been linked to lung carcinogenesis in both human and animal studies. Studies of smoking and nonsmoking uranium miners indicate that radon alone is a risk factor for lung cancer at the levels encountered by these miners, although the possibility exists that other substances in the mine environment affect the radon-induced response. The relevance of data from mines to the lower-exposure home environment is often questioned; still, a recent study of miners exposed to relatively low radon concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant increase for lung and laryngeal cancer deaths. In two major series of experiments with rats, the primary carcinogenic effect found was respiratory tract tumors, and evidence for an inverse exposure-rate effect was also noted. Although this inverse dose-rate effect also has been described in underground miner studies, it may not similarly apply to radon in the home environment. This observation is due to the fact that, below a certain exposure, cells are hit once or not at all, and one would not expect any dose-rate effect, either normal or inverse. Because some chromosome aberrations persist in cycling cells as stable events, cytogenetic studies with radon are being performed to help complete the understanding of the events leading to radon-induced neoplasia. Radon has been found to induce 13 times as much cytogenetic damage (as measured by the occurrence of micronuclei) than a similar dose of 60Co. A wide variety of mutation systems have demonstrated alpha-particle mutagenesis; recent investigations have focused on the molecular basis of alpha-induced mutagenesis. Gene mutations are induced by radon in a linear and dose-dependent fashion, and with a high biological effect relative to low-LET irradiation. Studies of the hprt locus show that approximately half of the alpha-induced mutations arise by complete deletion of the gene; the remaining mutations are split between partial deletions, rearrangements, and events not detectable by Southern blot or PCR exon analysis. Although other mutation systems do not show the same spectra as observed in the hprt gene (suggesting that the gene environment affects response), DNA deletions or multilocus lesions of various size appear to be predominant after radon exposure. As data emerge regarding radon-induced changes at the chromosomal and molecular level, the mechanisms involved in radon carcinogenesis are being clarified. This information should increase the understanding of risk at the low exposure levels typically found in the home. [References: 87]

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method

In all cases the diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory data, as well as radiographic images. Ten patients with false-negative CT scans had MRI confirming the presence of microadenomas less than 5 mm in size. The majority of patients (n = 51) were operated via transsphenoidal approach, transcranial route was utilized in 2 cases. Among the pathological findings, corticotropinomas were revealed in 49 cases, 4 patients were considered to have hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary without well demarcated adenoma. All patients were divided into 2 groups based on the history of previous treatment. Group 1 included 37 primary patients who had not been treated before admission. Group 2 included 16 patients treated surgically (e.g. neurosurgical operations, bilateral/unilateral adrenalectomy), or with irradiation therapy, including proton beam irradiation prior to admission. We came to conclusion that the following principles were essential in the management of Cushing's disease. 1. Properly interpreted clinical signs and symptoms along with biochemical data and radiographic imaging (including MRI) are extremely helpful in the preoperative evaluation of such patients. Our approach helped us reveal corticotropinomas with 98% accuracy. 2. Microsurgical removal was proved to be effective in up to 83% of patients, which was demonstrated by clinical and biochemical remission. 3. It should be emphasized that the results of treatment were significantly better in the first group versus the second one. In group 1, remission was reached in 91.1% of patients as compared to 62.5% in Group 2. 4. In primary patients, the trauma associated with surgical procedure is less and tumors demonstrate a less aggressive biological behavior

Comparable cytogenetic abnormalities have also been demonstrated in non-clonal cultures of alpha-irradiated primary human bone marrow, but a different pattern of delayed aberrations, mainly of chromosome-type, was found after X-irradiation in non-clonal cultures. In clonal analyses, delayed apoptotic cell death was evident after both X- and alpha-irradiation. It is suggested that the type of radiation exposure, the type of cell and its genetically determined susceptibility are factors that may influence the expression of delayed effects of radiation

We have extended these studies to human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines in order to establish an in vitro model system. The five cell lines analyzed, including one from a Fanconi anaemia patient, exhibited high levels of persistent chromatid aberrations up to approximately 40 cell generations after alpha-irradiation. The p53 status of the cell lines was defined according to whether cellular p53 levels were induced by irradiation, translocated to the nucleus and were able to bind a p53 DNA consensus recognition sequence in vitro. Together with the primary bone marrow cell studies, we conclude that alpha-particle induced chromosomal instability is independent of the p53 status of the cell as defined in these studies

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function

METHODS: Two patients initially diagnosed and treated for unilateral scleritis were referred for management of persistent inflammation. Additional evaluation uncovered underlying malignant processes. RESULTS: The first patient presented with scleritis initially responsive to systemic corticosteroids, with relapse one month later. Upon referral, peripheral fundus examination revealed elevated lesions. Additional studies confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The patient was treated with proton-beam irradiation. The second patient developed necrotizing scleritis unresponsive to systemic steroids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. A scleral biopsy disclosed an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma, likely metastatic. Exenteration was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis can present a diagnostic challenge. It is often the sole initial manifestation of an occult systemic problem. Treatment-resistant scleritis should raise the suspicion of an infectious or malignant masquerade

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1991, 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (stages IIB-IVA) were treated with a curative intent by external photon irradiation to the pelvis, followed by proton irradiation to the primary tumor, delivering a median total tumor dose of 86 Gy (range 71 Gy/26 Fr-101 Gy/46 Fr), and were followed for a median period of 139 months (range 11-184 months). RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 89% and 40%, respectively. Five-year local control rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 100% and 61%, respectively. Four percent of patients experienced severe (Grade 4 or more) late complications in the intestine or urinary bladder at 5 years. CONCLUSION: External photon and proton therapy is effective for those who are not eligible for intracavitary irradiation, and who otherwise have a poor prognosis. The results show that tumor control, survival, and morbidity are similar to those after conventional therapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new facility has a synchrotron with maximum energy of 250MeV and two rotational gantries. We treated 105 patients with 120 lesions with proton beams in the first year, beginning in September 2001. The most common lesion treated was primary liver cancer (40 lesions) followed by lung cancer, head and neck cancers, and prostate cancer. Concurrent X-ray radiotherapy was given for 38 of the 120 lesions. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 11 months (range, 1-19 months). Of the 105 patients, 97% had Grade 0-2 RTOG/EORTC acute morbidities, while the remaining 3% had Grade 3. Tumor response after irradiation was CR for 35% of the lesions, PR for 25%, SD for 22%, PD for 9%, and not evaluated for 9%. CONCLUSION: The proton beam therapy conducted at the new facility of the University of Tsukuba was safe and effective

A phase-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence was used to determine the temperature-related phase shifts during LITT. Temperature maps were displayed during therapy with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. Irradiation was discontinued as soon as the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm reached the margin of the tumor. A contrast-enhanced MRI study performed immediately after therapy showed a good correlation of the size of an enhancing rim around the lesion with the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm. The preliminary results of our study indicate that MRI guidance of LITT may be improved by temperature quantification based on the proton-resonance-frequency method

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus

The search for an underlying malignancy revealed a slightly enlarged cervical lymph node with Hodgkin's disease (HD). There was no evidence of a brain tumor despite nonspecific bright changes in proton density in the basal ganglia of the right hemisphere of the cerebellum, right cerebellar tonsil, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the right side of the medulla spinae as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as reactive lymphocytosis with slightly elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The findings suggested a cerebellar disorder, with main differential diagnosis between neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome (NPS) and HD involving the CNS. Based on limited experience with NPS and HD in the CNS, possible diagnostic and therapeutic options are discussed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I/II dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy. Fifty-seven patients with 64 sites of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for resection received carbon ion radiotherapy. Tumors involved the spine or paraspinous soft tissues in 19 patients, pelvis in 32 patients, and extremities in six patients. The total dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 gray equivalent (GyE) and was administered in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks (3.3 to 4.6 GyE/fraction). The median tumor size was 559 cm(3) (range, 20 to 2,290 cm(3)). The minimum follow-up was 18 months. RESULTS: Seven of 17 patients treated with the highest total dose of 73.6 GyE experienced Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 acute skin reactions. Dose escalation was then halted at this level. No other severe acute reactions (grade > 3) were observed in this series. The overall local control rates were 88% and 73% at 1 year and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. The median survival time was 31 months (range, 2 to 60 months), and the 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 82% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy seems to be a safe and effective modality in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not eligible for surgical resection, providing good local control and offering a survival advantage without unacceptable morbidity	
0	750	Radiation-induced brain metabolic changes in the acute and early delayed phase detected with quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy	Adult, Aged, Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Female, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Time Factors	OBJECTIVE: Quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed before and after radiation therapy to estimate its usefulness for evaluating radiation-induced metabolic brain changes. METHODS: Twenty patients with multiple brain metastases not having received any previous brain radiation were selected for the study. The total radiation dose varied from 40 (20 fractions) to 50 (25 fractions) Gy, with an opposition technique. MRS was performed just before irradiation, during the acute phase (n = 20, 8.5 +/- 4.6 days) and in the early delayed phase (n = 15, 3.6 +/- 0.5 months) after radiation. The concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), choline-containing substance (Cho), and creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) was quantified. RESULTS: The concentration of NAA decreased (P = 0.05 versus before radiation), and the concentration of Cho increased (P = 0.006 versus before radiation) during the early delayed phase. The concentration of Cr was not changed before or after radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced changes in brain metabolism were well detected with quantitative MRS in the early delayed phase. Quantitative MRS is a novel tool for estimating radiation-induced neurotoxicity

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At HIMAC, relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) values of therapeutic carbon beams were determined based on experimental results of cell responses, on values expected with the linear-quadratic model, and based on experiences with neutron therapy. We use fixed RBE values independent of dose levels, although this apparently contradicts radiobiologic observations. Our RBE system depends only on LET of the heavy-ion radiation fields. With this RBE system, over 2,000 patients have been treated by carbon beams. With data from these patients, the local control rate of non-small-cell lung cancer was analyzed to verify the clinical RBE of the carbon beam. The local control rate was compared with rates published by groups from Gunma University and Massachusetts General Hospital. Using a simplified tumor control probability (TCP) model, clinical RBE values were obtained for different levels of TCP. RESULTS: For the 50% level of the clinical TCP, the RBE values nearly coincide with those for in vitro human salivary gland cell survival at 10%. For the higher levels of clinical TCP, the RBE values approach closer to those adapted in clinical trials at HIMAC

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional CT sets for 10 lung cancer patients were used in this study. The internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) was obtained by combining the tumor volumes at different phases of the respiratory cycle. For each patient, we evaluated four planning strategies based on the following dose calculations: (1) the average (AVE) CT; (2) the free-breathing (FB) CT; (3) the maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT; and (4) the AVE CT in which the CT voxel values inside the IGTV were replaced by a constant density (AVE_RIGTV). For each strategy, the resulting cumulative dose distribution in a respiratory cycle was determined using a deformable image registration method. RESULTS: There were dosimetric differences between the apparent dose distribution, calculated on a single CT dataset, and the motion-corrected 4D dose distribution, calculated by combining dose distributions delivered to each phase of the 4DCT. The AVE_RIGTV plan using a 1-cm smearing parameter had the best overall target coverage and critical structure sparing. The MIP plan approach resulted in an unnecessarily large treatment volume. The AVE and FB plans using 1-cm smearing did not provide adequate 4D target coverage in all patients. By using a larger smearing value, adequate 4D target coverage could be achieved; however, critical organ doses were increased. CONCLUSION: The AVE_RIGTV approach is an effective strategy for designing proton treatment plans for mobile lung tumors

Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare neoplasm, even if its incidence has increased because of AIDS. Less than fifteen cases were described after organ transplantation. An intracranial localization is exceptional (five cases in the literature) and was never described after organ transplantation, to our knowledge. Our present report focuses on a 45-year-old immunocompromised patient, who received immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplantation. He suffered from atypical peri-orbital headaches six months after transplantation and a mass involving the cavernous sinus was identified. Surgical biopsy was performed. Histologic examination revealed a LMS. Epstein-Barr virus was identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the LMS. Immunosuppression was reduced, the patient received adriamycin and protontherapy was realized. He died two years after the transplantation because of tumor progression and kidney failure.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with meningioma of the skull base or spine were irradiated with helium charged particle radiotherapy at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (UCLBL) during the period 1981-1992. Twenty-six patients were treated for intracranial and three for spinal tumors. Total doses of 53.0-80.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) with a mean of 63 GyE were delivered using the helium ion beam. RESULTS: Ten-year local control and survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method were 84% and 80% respectively. Doses of 60.0 GyE were delivered with a low rate of complications. The only failures were in massive, recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: High doses using helium charged particle radiotherapy can be safely and effectively delivered to large residual or unresectable meningioma near radiosensitive structures

[Japanese]	Brachytherapy, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Informed Consent, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Male, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Quality of Life, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Relative Biological Effectiveness	Radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer has been developing dramatically during the past 10 years in Japan as well as in USA. There are several ways to treat prostate cancer by RT. As for external-beam RT (EBRT), a more sophisticated technique beyond 3-dimensional conformal RT called intensity modulated RT was developed and has been in use in many Japanese RT centers. It can raise the total radiation dose and is expected to increase the biochemical control rate. As for brachytherapy, a low-dose-rate seed implant using iodine-125 was initiated in 2003 and has become widespread throughout Japan in only a few years. High-dose-rate brachytherapy using iridium-19 2 has also been used in more advanced cases combined with EBRT. Brachytherapy offers an ideal RT dose concentration and can avoid rectal complications. As for particle therapy, we have carbon and proton in several institutions in Japan. Particles have the merit of good dose distributions and for carbons, relative biological effectiveness. Furthermore, some centers are considering the stereotactic hypofractionated RT due to the relatively low alfa-beta ratio of prostate cancer. Recent reports showed that after a certain period of followup, the biochemical control rate was similar either with external beam high-quality RT, brachytherapy, heavy ion RT and surgery. Therefore, the choice of treatment should depend on the adverse effects, quality of life, medical costs, and the lifestyle of the patient. The merits and demerits of each treatment modality were discussed. Longer follow-up is still necessary and informed consent is mandatory when choosing a treatment modality	
1	1964	A system for three-dimensional dosimetric verification of treatment plans in intensity-modulated radiotherapy with heavy ions	Arm, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Computer Simulation, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Reproducibility of Results, Water	The introduction of dynamic intensity modulation into radiotherapy using conventional photon beams or scanning particle beams requires additional and efficient methods of dose verification. Dose measurements in dynamically generated dose distributions with a single ionization chamber require a complete application of the treatment field for each single measurement. Therefore measurements are performed by simultaneous use of multiple ionization chambers. The measurement is performed by a computer controlled system and is comprised of the following steps: (a) automated positioning of the ionization chambers, (b) measurement at these points, (c) a comparison with the calculated dose from the treatment planning system, and (d) documentation of the measurement. The ionization chambers are read out by a multichannel electrometer and are densely packed into a mounting of polymethylmetacrylate, which is attached to the arm of a three-dimensional motor-driven water phantom. The measured and planned dose values are displayed numerically as well as graphically. The mean deviation between measured and planned doses as well as their standard deviation are calculated and displayed. Through printouts complete documentation of the measurement is obtained and a quick decision can be made whether the dose distribution is acceptable for the patient. The system is now routinely used for dose verification at the heavy ion therapy project at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. Up to now 242 measurements have been performed for heavy ion treatment of 30 patients. The system allows efficient verification and documentation of carbon ion fields and is in principle also applicable to intensity-modulated photon beams	
1	1965	Quality management of medical physics issues at the German heavy ion therapy project	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Calibration, Germany, Heavy Ions, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Physics, Quality Control, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Time Factors	For the commissioning and operation of the German Heavy Ion Therapy Project a quality assurance program was developed and successfully applied. The complete radiotherapy process using heavy ions was carefully analyzed and divided into three areas related to beam delivery and control, safety-interlock system and medical physics issues. In this paper, the medical physics issues are addressed. Since the irradiation with heavy ions is a nonstandard modality, new concepts and ion specific tests were developed. As far as possible, national and international standard specifications for radiotherapy were adopted. For each aspect, a performance characteristic and a corresponding acceptance test were introduced. In addition, test characteristics for the constancy tests were established. For all tests, intervention thresholds and test frequencies were specified. Using the described protocol of acceptance tests, the commissioning was passed successfully. The heavy ion irradiation facility was approved by the governmental authorities on the basis of these test results. During clinical operation, constancy tests are performed at the beginning of each treatment period, in order to maintain the quality found during the acceptance tests. Up to now, 48 patients have been treated within 6 treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The concepts used and the tests developed for the quality assurance program may serve as an example of how to introduce systematically a quality assurance program for a new treatment modality

[Review] [27 refs] [German]	Calibration, Carbon, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods]	Since December 1997, patients are treated with carbon ions at GSI (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung). Dose delivery is performed with the intensity-controlled raster-scanning technique, which allows a highly conformal treatment of the tumor. To meet the special requirements of dosimetry with heavy ion beams, new dosimetric measurement techniques were developed and introduced into clinical application by the DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum). The techniques comprise calibration of the irradiation monitor, checks of lateral and depth dose profiles, as well as verification of the beam delivery for complex three-dimensional dose distributions. The developed dosimetric methods are now integral part of clinical application and enable safe treatment with carbon ion therapy. [References: 27]

The distribution was determined for four nuclides: 232Th and its decay products, 228Ra and 228Th; and 230Th, a contaminant associated with Thorotrast. More than 90% of the activity was associated with the reticuloendothelial system. Approximately 32% of the total activity was found in the total skeleton (mineral bone and bone marrow), which is somewhat higher than expected from the literature. The 44% found in the liver and 12% in the spleen were somewhat lower than expected. This difference may be attributable, in part, to the initial deposition as influenced by colloidal particle size and to the radiation-induced hyposplenism, splenic atrophy, and slight hepatic atrophy observed at autopsy. In addition, roughly 3% of the activity was found in the Thorotrastoma and surrounding carotid artery tissue. Estimated lifetime absorbed doses from the 232Th series were 15 Gy to the liver, 121 Gy to the spleen, 4 Gy to the skeleton, and 16 Gy to the Thorotrastoma. Comparable dose equivalents to these tissues are 300, 2420, 80, and 320 Sv, respectively, assuming a quality factor of 20 for alpha irradiation

Thirty percent of them, along with 10 percent of patients who did not undergo operations, underwent radiation therapy. The result of external radiation monotherapy for local advanced pancreatic cancer is so poor that the 2-year survival rate and the median survival time have been reported in some papers to be approximately 10% and at most 13 months, respectively. Our results indicated that the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates and the median survival time after external radiation monotherapy for local advanced pancreatic cancer were 21%, 11%, 5% and 11.3 months, respectively. The reasons for the poor results are thought to be as follows: pancreatic cancer is very malignant, invades the surrounding tissues and metastasizes distantly in its earliest stages; it is mostly adenocarcinoma resistant to radiation therapy; and the pancreas borders closely the stomach and duodenum, which are very sensitive to radiation. Therefore, charged particle radiotherapy, especially heavy ion radiotherapy, is expected to bring about advances in the field of radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer because of its excellent potential for dose distribution and biological effect.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and February 1997, 24 patients with histopathologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were treated to 15 fractions within 5 weeks in a step-wise dose-escalation study. The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92% and 92%, 81% and 50%, and 81% and 25% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy appears safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional clinical studies using a larger subject group are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support continued investigation to confirm therapeutic efficacy

The system consisted of a conventional linear accelerator, invasive fixation head frame (RADFRAME, Mizuho Ika Kogyo), and a tungsten collimator. The RADFRAME was developed to be used with any linear accelerators and with any dose planning systems. The accuracy of the irradiation was assured to be within +/-1.5mm. Fifty-one patients with metastatic brain tumors were treated using the system. The overall median survival time was 10 months. No difference in survival was observed between patients with a single lesion and patients with two or three lesions. Complete, partial, and minimal responses were obtained in 16 (39%), 18 (41%), and 7 (16%) lesions. These were comparable to the reported results of gamma knife treatment. A maximum dose of 25 Gy was suggested to be more effective than lower doses. Local control rate was higher in tumors with a diameter of less than 2.0cm (87.5%) than in larger tumors (60%). No difference in tumor response was observed among various histopathologic types. In a patient with a 25mm cerebellar metastasis from an adenocarcinoma of the lung, autopsy at 5 months after STI showed fibrinoid degeneration and hyaline deposition without residual tumor at the Gd-enhanced region on MRI. The efficacy of linac stereotactic irradiation was equal to that of gamma knife radiotherapy for metastatic brain tumors

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290MeV/u), silicon (490MeV/u) and iron (200 and 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. PCC were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 min. RESULTS: The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components representing a rapid and a slow time constant. Chromatid breaks decreased rapidly during the first 10min after exposure, then continued to decrease at a slower rate. The rejoining kinetics were similar for exposure to each type of radiation. Chromatid exchanges were also formed quickly. Compared to low-LET radiation, isochromatid breaks were produced more frequently and the proportion of unrejoined breaks was higher for high-LET radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gamma-rays, isochromatid breaks were observed more frequently in high-LET irradiated samples, suggesting that an increase in isochromatid breaks is a signature of high-LET radiation exposure

PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 57 patients with a median age of 55 years. Management included plaque radiotherapy (14), proton beam radiotherapy (17), local resection (10), endoresection (6), and enucleation (10). Fifty-two tumours involved the choroid. The tumours had a mean diameter of 11.4 mm and a mean thickness of 5.2 mm. RESULTS: The follow-up period had a median of 267 days. Retention of the eye was achieved in all 47 cases who underwent conservative management. Ninety percent of patients retained a vision of counting fingers, with an acuity of 6/12 or better in 50%. CONCLUSION: This group of patients gives an indication of the results that can be expected when uveal melanoma is managed by a variety of conservative techniques in a specialised ocular oncology service

In the absence of metastases, eye-preserving treatment is possible in principle. Since 1984, Dutch patients are referred for eye-preserving treatment to Leiden University Hospital which consequently has gained great experience. Brachytherapy (with Ruthenium-106 applicators) is only suitable for uveal melanomas with a diameter < or = 15 mm and a prominence (thickness perpendicular to the sclera) < or = 5 mm; after 10 years, the eye was preserved in 80% of the patients; 75% retained a visual acuity > or = 0.25. Proton irradiation is being applied for large, strongly prominent melanomas in patients for whom enucleation is not acceptable, for instance with a melanoma in the only eye still functioning. The eyes could be preserved in 83.3% over a period of 5 years. Transpupillary thermotherapy combined with episcleral Ruthenium-106 application is called sandwich therapy; in a study involving 50 patients, 49 melanomas (98%) began to regress within 4 weeks and after a follow-up period of 12 months all tumours with a prominence < 5 mm had regressed completely.

[Review] [24 refs]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Combined Modality Therapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Giant Cell Tumors/rt [Radiotherapy], Giant Cell Tumors/su [Surgery], Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Remission Induction, Retrospective Studies, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome	Optimal treatment for giant cell tumors in the axial skeleton (GCTS) remains challenging. Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice, but the potential spinal cord injury may limit the extent of resection. We report the long-term results of treatment of six patients diagnosed with giant cell tumor of the spine treated with radiotherapy and review the literature regarding therapy. Between 1971 and 1995, six patients with GCTS were treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy. The surgery consisted of either biopsy or subtotal resection of tumor. The involved vertebrae were then irradiated with doses ranging from 3000 to 5400 cGy. The mean follow-up was 13 years, and three of six patients had follow-up of 17 or more years. Five of six patients are alive with no evidence of disease. One is alive with disease, although it is not clinically apparent. No patient was lost to follow-up. We conclude that radiotherapy is useful in the management of GCTS and that conservative surgery with local radiotherapy is a reasonable treatment alternative for tumors that cannot be completely excised or in which surgery would result in significant functional morbidity. Although there is no clear dose response, review of the literature suggests that doses ranging from 3500 to 4500 cGy are safe and effective in controlling giant cell tumor. [References: 24]

The AR was found to be present in cells pre-exposed to 3 cGy of X-rays in G0, G1 and S phase as well as with tritiated water (4 muCi/ml) when the 'challenge' dose was given in G2. There was no AR after prior exposure of the cells in S phase to secondary irradiation from 70 GeV protons. The AR was not observed after preliminary X-irradiation of the lymphocytes in G0 and G1 and 'challenge' irradiation in G1. Cells from 6 patients with Down's syndrome were tested. At least 5 of them did not show the AR. The AR is considered to be a phenomenon of the antimutagenic aftereffect

This tremor has been considered to result from the lesions in the vicinity of the red nucleus in the midbrain. There has been no systematic analysis of the surgical target in the Holmes' tremor so far of nucleus ventrointermedius (Vim) or globus pallidus interna. This 26 year old man gradually developed a disabling midbrain tremor involving both the distal and proximal parts of the left upper arm. Additional neurological findings included oculomotor palsy and ataxia of the left arm. On the radiological studies, a mass lesion (germinoma) was found on the midbrain tegmentum, which was treated by conventional radiation therapy. Although there was improvement in the radiological imaging, his midbrain tremor became intolerable despite medical treatment. The authors performed MR guided stereotactic Vim thalamotomy. With radiofrequency lesioning in the right Vim, his resting, postural, and action tremors were much alleviated in both the distal and proximal parts of the left upper extremity. The authors consider that Vim thalamotomy is still an effective means of controlling midbrain tremors involving the proximal upper limb

Most patients had large melanomas; no eyes containing small melanomas developed anterior segment neovascularization. The mean onset of glaucoma was 14.1 months (range, 7-31 months). The incidence of anterior segment neovascularization increased with radiation dosage; there was an approximately three-fold increase at 80 GyE versus 60 GyE of helium ion radiation (23% vs. 8.5%) (P less than 0.05). Neovascular glaucoma occurred more commonly in larger tumors; the incidence was not affected by tumor location, presence of subretinal fluid, nor rate of tumor regression. Fifty-three percent of patients had some response with intraocular pressures of 21 mmHg or less to a combination of antiglaucoma treatments

A modified linear accelerator was used in a moving field technique with multiple pendulum planes to apply single doses between 8 and 28 Gy by means of stereotaxis into the angiographically determined target volume. The medium follow-up is 23 months. The latency of radiogenic effects is between one and two years. Radiological controls with an interval of more than 18 months after therapy are available in 17 out of 41 patients. Angiographic investigation showed complete obliterations of pathological vessels in six out of these patients and partial obliterations in six patients; five patients remained unchanged. There were no acute complications. Seven patients presented neurological deficiencies with a latency of 6 to 12 months, however, in all cases but one they regressed completely. Even taking into consideration the small number of patients and the short time of observation, a comparison with the results of other radiotherapeutical proceedings allows to draw the conclusion that the presented technique of stereotaxic convergent-beam irradiation represents a relatively simple, reliable and, in case of precise indication, efficient method for the therapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations

In 72% of the patients a palliative effect was seen with considerable or complete pain relief. The median survival times of the patients with and without remote metastases were 7 and 15 months, respectively. Radiobiological experience leads us to expect a higher degree of efficacy when using highly ionising radiation such as neutrons. The relatively poor physical parameters of conventional neutron generators were optimised by means of a novel irradiation technique developed at the German Research Centre in Heidelberg. Using this technique, a study was started for the combined photon/neutron irradiation in recurrent sacral tumours. 14 MeV neutrons of a DT (deuterium-tritium) generator ("KARIN" supplied by Haefely) were applied as boost. 26 patients have so far been treated by this method. Palliative results are excellent and the results obtained so far have been so encouraging that an extension of the study is under consideration

There are rare cases showing progressive space-occupying radiation necrosis (PSORN). It is very difficult to control PSORN by conservative treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early diagnosis of those cases and the timing of surgery for patients with PSORN. METHOD: We have experienced some cases where quality of life was improved by the removal of PSORN after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases. Therefore, we evaluated retrospectively the diagnosis and treatment of six cases of symptomatic PSORN at approximately 6-12 months after SRS for metastatic brain tumours. FINDINGS: In all six cases, on Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Gd contrast material (Gd-MRI), PSORN was revealed as a ring-like enhanced mass with large perifocal oedema coupled with the appearance of neurological deficit. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) enabled us to differentiate PSORN from recurrence of metastases in all six cases. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography with thallium-201 chloride (201TlCl-SPECT) enabled us to do this in four cases of the six. In four cases of the six, lesionectomy of the ring-like enhanced mass (PSORN) was performed, and in two of these cases the removal was performed within 4 weeks from the time when conservative treatment became ineffective, and the neurological deficit and perifocal oedema was improved as was the quality of life. However, in the other two patients who were left for more than 16 weeks, the deficit was gradually progressive. The two patients who did not receive lesionectomy were treated by conservative means with steroids and/or heparin and warfarin and they had progressive neurological symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Although, the number of patients is small in this study, and more data will be needed, it is recommended that lesionectomy is performed at an early stage, if possible, when conservative management has failed

METHODS: Forty patients with a total of 47 metastatic brain tumors were evaluated. The primary lesion was identified in all cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery was effective in 37 lesions. All patients were examined using Gd-enhanced MR imaging before and after SRS. Thalium-201 chloride was administered to 27 patients with 34 tumors and SPECT images were obtained. Proton MR spectroscopy was performed in 36 patients who harbored 43 tumors. On Gd-enhanced MR images, a decrease in the volume of the Gd-enhanced lesion and a change in the enhanced effect in the lesion after treatment were recognized as showing the effectiveness of SRS between 1 and 3 months or more (mean 8.54 +/- 3.58 weeks). In 201TlCl-SPECT studies, the ratio of lesion to normal brain decreased from 2 weeks to 2 months (mean 5.03 +/- 2.77 weeks) after radiosurgery. On 1H-MR spectroscopy images a high choline (Cho) peak and a lipid-dominant (Lip) peak were observed in 25 lesions and a high Cho peak and a lactate-dominant (Lac) peak were observed in 12 lesions before SRS. A decrease in the Cho peak, a disappearance of the Lac peak, and an increase in the Lip peak were observed between 1 week and 1 month (mean 2.76 +/- 1.62 weeks) after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on histopathological findings obtained at autopsy or at surgery, we assume that a high Cho peak may be observed in viable tumor tissue and a Lip peak in areas of necrosis. The results indicate that 1H-MR spectroscopy is potentially a more sensitive tool in evaluating the response to SRS than 201TlCl-SPECT or Gd-enhanced MR imaging and that it can be used earlier for this purpose than those other imaging methods

In all of these patients, the micronucleus frequency increased after BNCT; the number of micronuclei per 1000 binucleated T-lymphocytes after BNCT increased by 33.0 +/- 12.2 for brain tumor patients and 22.8 +/- 10.3 for head-and-neck cancer patients. In 14 thyroid cancer patients who were administered radioiodine (3.3-5.6 GBq) treatment, the frequency of micronuclei after internal radioiodine therapy increased to 105.0 +/- 30.5 per 1000 binucleated T-lymphocytes. The increased micronucleus frequency of BNCT patients was less than one-third that seen for thyroid cancer patients after radioiodine treatment. These results demonstrate the usefulness of BNCT for selective high-LET radiotherapy, in association with a low irradiation effect of cytological radiation damage after BNCT, which provides a high tumor target dose for each cancer patient

METHODS: We studied the effects of interstitial brachytherapy on the brains of healthy monkeys and in humans with glioblastoma multiforme. The effects of radiation therapy on normal brain tissue in monkeys were assessed with sequential proton MR spectroscopic studies 1 week to 6 months after brachytherapy. Proton MR spectroscopy was also performed in five patients with residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (three of whom had radiation necrosis after brachytherapy), seven patients with newly diagnosed untreated glioblastoma multiforme, and 16 healthy volunteers, who served as a control group. RESULTS: In monkeys, the ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr) and the ratio of choline-containing compounds (Cho) to Cr of the reference point were significantly lower 1 week after brachytherapy than before treatment. The ratio of NAA to Cho of the irradiated area tended to be higher 1 week after brachytherapy than before irradiation. These peak metabolic ratios showed characteristic changes 6 months after treatment. In two of three monkeys, lipid signal was elevated 6 months after irradiation. In the clinical study, the ratio of NAA to Cho in the area of radiation necrosis was significantly different from that in glioblastoma multiforme when compared with the contralateral hemisphere after irradiation. In addition, lipid signal was detected in all patients with radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: It might be possible to use proton MR spectroscopy to differentiate radiation necrosis from residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme on the basis of comparisons with the contralateral hemisphere after radiation therapy

In this high risk group of patients, total body irradiation (TBI) has been proposed as a systemic adjuvant. To aid in the design of a clinical TBI protocol, we have studied the in vitro radiation response of two established cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma and human bone marrow CFUc. The Ewing's lines showed a larger Do (1.26 Gy, 2.04 Gy) and n (6.0, 3.2) compared to the bone marrow CFUc (Do = 0.86 Gy, n = 1.2). No repair of potentially lethal radiation damage (PLDR) was found after 4.5 Gy in plateau phase Ewing's sarcoma cells. A theoretical split dose survival curve for both the Ewing's sarcoma lines and human bone marrow CFUc using this TBI schedule shows a significantly lower surviving fraction (10(-4)-10(-5] for the bone marrow CFUc. Based on these in vitro results, two 4.0 Gy fractions separated by 24 hours is proposed as the TBI regimen. Because of the potentially irreversible damage to bone marrow, autologous bone marrow transplantation following the TBI is felt to be necessary. The details of this clinical protocol in high risk Ewing's sarcoma patients are outlined

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 76-year old patients who presented a diffuse centroblastic high malignant NHL recurrence in the left scrotal sac was examined with 31-P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before, during and after megavoltage radiotherapy to a total dose of 56 Gy. RESULTS: The 31-P MRS spectrum of the tumor showed before starting irradiation, intensive phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals that overlapped the inorganic phosphate (Pi) signal. After 26 Gy irradiation, the Pi peak appeared and revealed an intratumoral pH of 7.08 very close to that in the normal testis (pH of 7.02). After 56 Gy the tumor disappeared and a complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. 31-P MRS is sensitive to the changes in the tumor metabolic activity after irradiation with a dose of 26 Gy. 2. Pi and PME peaks could be good pathological markers in the steady-state response to irradiation. 3. MRI could confirm the radiation induced tumor regression and the achieved clinical complete remission

Proton beam irradiation of the uterus was combined with gamma-beam therapy of the zones of regional metastatic spreading. Postradiation reactions were unobserved in the adjacent bladder and rectum in patients receiving combined therapy and irradiation alone. The clinical efficacy of proton beam irradiation was confirmed by the treatment of 160 patients

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases

Heavy-ion therapy has been applied for various solid tumors including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Although the local control rate of carbon ion radiotherapy for esophageal cancer has revealed better rates than that of conventional radiotherapy, some patients have shown resistance to the treatment. No study has evaluated whether anti-cancer drugs can enhance the anti-tumor effect of heavy carbon-ion beam irradiation. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of docetaxel, fluorouracil, cisplatinum, doxorubicin and gemcitabine to enhance the anti-tumor effects of heavy carbon-ion beam irradiation on human esophageal SCC cells in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Fluorouracil, cisplatinum, doxorubicin and gemcitabine showed only additive anti-tumor effects. On the other hand, growth suppression was significantly potentiated by the combined treatment with heavy carbon-ion beam and docetaxel as compared to that treated with either agent alone. These data suggest that heavy carbon-ion beam irradiation combined with docetaxel may be a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for locally advanced esophageal SCC

[Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities, Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The indications for curative treatment with proton therapy were investigated by the clinical results of 31 cancer patients treated with proton beams between 1983 and 1985 at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center of Tsukuba University. Many locally extended, radioresistant lesions, lesions with large volume and small radiocurable lesions in this series revealed sufficient improvement without definite late damage in the surrounding normal tissues. This clinical result suggests that proton beam treatment could be applied to lesions in a much wider range for curative purposes as compared with conventional radiotherapy. This study is to be continued further

Conventional MR imaging, however, cannot always depict treatment-induced transient WM abnormalities. We investigated the ability of diffusion-tensor (DT) MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy to detect the treatment-induced transient changes within normal-appearing WM. METHODS: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed in 8 patients treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for brain tumors (17 examinations) and 11 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, fractional anisotropy (FA) value, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio were obtained from 27 hemispheres with normal-appearing WM in the patients. We divided the datasets of isotropic ADC, FA, and NAA/Cr, on the basis of the time period after completion of radiation therapy, into 4 groups: group 1 (0-2 months; n = 10), group 2 (3-5 months; n = 5), group 3 (6-9 months; n = 7), and group 4 (10-12 months; n = 5). We compared averages of mean isotropic ADC, mean FA, and NAA/Cr of each patient group with those of the control group by using a t test. RESULTS: In the group 2, averages of mean FA and NAA/Cr decreased and average of mean isotopic ADC increased in comparison with those of the control group (P = .004, .04, and .0085, respectively). There were no significant differences in the averages between the control group and patient groups 1, 3, and 4. CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy can provide quantitative indices that may reflect treatment-induced transient derangement of normal-appearing WM	
0	1497	Three-dimensional intrafractional movement of prostate measured during real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy in supine and prone treatment positions	Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Fourier Analysis, Gold, Humans, Japan, Male, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prone Position, Prostate, Prostate/re [Radiation Effects], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Supine Position, Time, Uncertainty	PURPOSE: To quantify three-dimensional (3D) movement of the prostate gland with the patient in the supine and prone positions and to analyze the movement frequency for each treatment position. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) system was developed to identify the 3D position of a 2-mm gold marker implanted in the prostate 30 times/s using two sets of fluoroscopic images. The linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the gold marker was located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. Ten patients with prostate cancer treated with RTRT were the subjects of this study. The coordinates of the gold marker were recorded every 0.033 s during RTRT in the supine treatment position for 2 min. The patient was then moved to the prone position, and the marker was tracked for 2 min to acquire data regarding movement in this position. Measurements were taken 5 times for each patient (once a week); a total of 50 sets for the 10 patients was analyzed. The raw data from the RTRT system were filtered to reduce system noise, and the amplitude of movement was then calculated. The discrete Fourier transform of the unfiltered data was performed for the frequency analysis of prostate movement. RESULTS: No apparent difference in movement was found among individuals. The amplitude of 3D movement was 0.1-2.7 mm in the supine and 0.4-24 mm in the prone positions. The amplitude in the supine position was statistically smaller in all directions than that in the prone position (p < 0.0001). The amplitude in the craniocaudal and AP directions was larger than in the left-right direction in the prone position (p < 0.0001). No characteristic movement frequency was detected in the supine position. The respiratory frequency was detected for all patients regarding movement in the craniocaudal and AP directions in the prone position. The results of the frequency analysis suggest that prostate movement is affected by the respiratory cycle and is influenced by bowel movement in the prone position. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have confirmed that internal organ motion is less frequent in the supine position than in the prone position in the treatment of prostate cancer. RTRT would be useful in reducing uncertainty due to the effects of the respiratory cycle, especially in the prone position	
0	1331	Tumor location, cirrhosis, and surgical history contribute to tumor movement in the liver, as measured during stereotactic irradiation using a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system	Computer Systems, Fluoroscopy, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Hepatectomy, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Liver Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) intrafractional motion of liver tumors during real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 20 patients with liver tumors were analyzed. Before treatment, a 2-mm gold marker was implanted near the tumor. The RTRT system used fluoroscopy image processor units to determine the 3D position of the implanted marker. A linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker was located within a permitted region. The automatically recorded tumor-motion data were analyzed to determine the amplitude of the tumor motion, curve shape of the tumor motion, treatment efficiency, frequency of movement, and hysteresis. Each of the following clinical factors was evaluated to determine its contribution to the amplitude of movement: tumor position, existence of cirrhosis, surgical history, tumor volume, and distance between the isocenter and the marker. RESULTS: The average amplitude of tumor motion in the 20 patients was 4 +/- 4 mm (range 1-12), 9 +/- 5 mm (range 2-19), and 5 +/- 3 mm (range 2-12) in the left-right, craniocaudal, and anterior-posterior (AP) direction, respectively. The tumor motion of the right lobe was significantly larger than that of the left lobe in the left-right and AP directions (p = 0.01). The tumor motion of the patients with liver cirrhosis was significantly larger than that of the patients without liver cirrhosis in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.004). The tumor motion of the patients who had received partial hepatectomy was significantly smaller than that of the patients who had no history of any operation on the liver in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.03). Thus, three of the five clinical factors examined (i.e., tumor position in the liver, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver) significantly affected the tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction during stereotactic irradiation. Frequency analysis revealed that for 9 (45%) of the 20 tumors, the cardiac beat caused measurable motion. The 3D trajectory of the tumor showed hysteresis for 4 (20%) of the 20 tumors. The average treatment efficiency of RTRT was 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver all had an impact on the intrafractional tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction. This finding should be helpful in determining the smallest possible margin in individual cases of radiotherapy for liver malignancy

The 1st group (10 persons) was treated by combined therapy including preoperative irradiation with fast neutrons: 2 fractions a week at a dose of 1.2-1.4 Gy, total focal dose of 10 Gy corresponding to an equivalent dose of 40 Gy. Surgical intervention was performed in 10-15 days. In the 1st group during the post-operative period there were no complications, the period of wound healing was not increased as compared to that in the use of routine methods of combined therapy of tumors of the above site. In the 2nd group (6 persons) surgical intervention was performed 2-3 mos. after a radical course of combined neutron-photon therapy. The frequency of postoperative complications was 67%. The period of post-operative wound healing considerably increased

Twenty-five proton chemical shift imaging studies and conventional magnetic resonance images were performed on six patients with intracranial tumors. The peak areas of N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine, and lipids were calculated and normalized to N-acetylaspartate in the contralateral hemisphere. The spectra from the lesion before treatment showed a relatively high Cho peak, reported as a characteristic spectrum of tumors. Tumor size and Cho level after radiosurgery did not increase except in two cases. In these cases, radiation necrosis was observed with elevated Cho and a mobile lipid peak. Stable or decreased Cho seems to suggest a loss of tumor viability, and changes in Cho indicate the effectiveness of radiosurgery. Increasing Cho and the appearance of the mobile lipid peak may distinguish radiation necrosis from recurrent tumors, which cannot be distinguished by magnetic resonance imaging

We have treated such patients with stereotactic Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy and report the follow-up of 74 of the first 75, 2 to 16 years after treatment. Proton-beam therapy is intended to induce subendothelial deposition of collagen and hyaline substance, which narrows the lumens of small vessels and thickens the walls of the malformation during the first 12 to 24 months after the procedure. Two deaths from hemorrhage occurred in the first 12 months after treatment, but no lethal or disabling hemorrhages occurred after this interval. Seizures, headaches, and progressive neurologic deficits were in most cases arrested or improved. Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy appears to be a useful technique for treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations, especially those that are unsuitable for treatment by other methods

The irradiated cohort consisted of 167 patients treated at the Donner Pavilion (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley), and the comparison cohort was the population evaluated in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR). Survival analyses were performed comparing the two cohorts using three different sets of matching criteria, each more restrictive than the previous analyses. The three different strategies were (1) matched only on severity of diabetic retinopathy; (2) matched on severity of retinopathy and age; and (3) matched on severity of retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status. Tests of comparison were the log-rank test, the Wilcoxon test, and the likelihood ratio test. For the model matching only on severity of retinopathy, mean survival was 8.3 years for the WESDR group and 9.4 years for the ablated group (p > 0.05 for all three statistical tests). For the model matched on retinopathy and age, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 9.2 years for the ablated group (p=0.05 log-rank test, 0.32 Wilcoxon test, and 0.06 likelihood ratio test). For the model matching on retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 11.6 years for the ablated group (p=0.72 log-rank test, 0.08 Wilcoxon test, and 0.82 likelihood ratio test). These data are compatible with the notion that pituitary ablation, and therefore induced pituitary growth hormone deficiency, may not decrease survival in those with severe diabetic retinopathy	
1	595	Peripheral doses from pediatric IMRT	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	Peripheral dose (PD) data exist for conventional fields (> or = 10 cm) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery to standard adult-sized phantoms. Pediatric peripheral dose reports are limited to conventional therapy and are model based. Our goal was to ascertain whether data acquired from full phantom studies and/or pediatric models, with IMRT treatment times, could predict Organ at Risk (OAR) dose for pediatric IMRT. As monitor units (MUs) are greater for IMRT, it is expected IMRT PD will be higher; potentially compounded by decreased patient size (absorption). Baseline slab phantom peripheral dose measurements were conducted for very small field sizes (from 2 to 10 cm). Data were collected at distances ranging from 5 to 72 cm away from the field edges. Collimation was either with the collimating jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC) oriented either perpendicular or along the peripheral dose measurement plane. For the clinical tests, five patients with intracranial or base of skull lesions were chosen. IMRT and conventional three-dimensional (3D) plans for the same patient/target/dose (180 cGy), were optimized without limitation to the number of fields or wedge use. Six MV, 120-leaf MLC Varian axial beams were used. A phantom mimicking a 3-year-old was configured per Center for Disease Control data. Micro (0.125 cc) and cylindrical (0.6 cc) ionization chambers were appropriated for the thyroid, breast, ovaries, and testes. The PD was recorded by electrometers set to the 10(-10) scale. Each system set was uniquely calibrated. For the slab phantom studies, close peripheral points were found to have a higher dose for low energy and larger field size and when MLC was not deployed. For points more distant from the field edge, the PD was higher for high-energy beams. MLC orientation was found to be inconsequential for the small fields tested. The thyroid dose was lower for IMRT delivery than that predicted for conventional (ratio of IMRT/conventional ranged from 0.47-0.94) doses approximately [0.4-1.8 cGy]/[0.9-2.9 cGy]/fraction, respectively. Prior phantom reports are for fields 10 cm or greater, while pediatric central nervous system fields range from 4 to 7 cm, and effectively much smaller for IMRT (2-6 cm). Peripheral dose in close proximity (< 10 cm from the field edge) is dominated by internal scatter; therefore, field-size differences overwhelm phantom size affects and increased MU. Distant peripheral dose, dominated by head leakage, was higher than predicted, even when accounting for MUs (approximtely factor of 3) likely due to the pediatric phantom size. The ratio of the testes dose ranged from 3.3-5.3 for IMRT/conventional. PD to OAR for pediatric IMRT cannot be predicted from large-field full phantom studies. For regional OAR, doses are likely lower than predicted by existing "large field" data, while the distant PD is higher

1	3260	Photoneutrons from high energy medical linear accelerators: measurement of the spectrum and dose using a miniature proportional counter	Humans, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Pressure, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: A new method of measuring photoneutron dose to the patient during treatment with high energy photon or electron beams is presented. This method has the advantage of providing not only the dose, but the microdosimetric spectrum at the same time. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A miniature cylindrical gas proportional counter (0.5 mm diameter by 0.5 mm height) has been used to measure scatter radiation from a 20 MV teletherapy photon beam. At atmospheric pressure, filled with propane base tissue equivalent gas, this counter simulates a unit density tissue region of approximately 0.9 microns. We present here single event microdosimetric spectra measured outside the primary beam 1.4 m from the target. This technique allows a single measurement to determine the scattered dose due to gammas and photoneutron contamination, as well as the quality factor of the photoneutrons. RESULTS: Spectral components from scattered photons and the photoneutrons are easily separated, and dose contributions can be estimated. The ratio of photoneutron dose measured by the proportional counter to photon dose at isocenter is 0.75 x 10(-4). CONCLUSIONS: Neutron dose was also measured using a bubble neutrometer. The proportional counter and neutrometer agree within experimental errors. This type of instrument is shown to be a viable technique for determination of exposure of patient and also personnel to photoneutrons, providing not only a dose determination, but also a spectrum that can be used to estimate quality factors for equivalent dose. Its main drawback is that it requires a lengthy (several hours) measurement because of low count rate of the neutrons

The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

An additional 30 tumors in the total patient population were treated with 100 kVp x-rays to assess comparative effects on skin nodules and 8 patients received additive photon or electron radiation to pion-treated portals. Of 52 evaluable tumors in 20 patients treated with pions only and followed for 3 to 22 months, 81% (42 tumors) completely regressed; 6% (3 tumors) partially regressed; and 13% (7 tumors) did not respond, although 5 of the 7 have shown no growth for 10 months. Of eight tumors in seven patients treated with a combination of pions and conventional radiation, three tumors showed complete response and five tumors showed partial response, though the resected specimens in two (one with complete and one with partial response) revealed no tumor microscopically. Reactions in normal tissues have been mild, with some patients exhibiting no normal tissue reaction, as compared with relatively marked tumor response

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 24 children treated between 1986 and 1994, no head fixation was applied and boost irradiation was not based on individual radiation treatment planning. Since 1995, boost irradiation has been assisted by CT-based individual radiation treatment planning and ORFIT head fixation in 59 patients. The influence of various factors including age, sex, tumor location, extent, type of surgery, risk group, radiation dose to posterior fossa and spinal axis, and the effect of head fixation and CT-assisted radiation treatment planning on 5-year relapse-free and 5-year overall survival was investigated. RESULTS: Overall and relapse-free survival rates for all 83 patients were 73.5% and 60.7%. Univariate analysis identified metastatic disease (p = 0.034) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.013) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Relapse-free survival rates were influenced by metastatic disease (p = 0.028) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.009). On multivariate analysis, metastatic disease (p = 0.04) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.045) were significant factors for overall and relapse-free survival (p = 0.036 and p = 0.041) as well. CONCLUSION: Metastatic disease appears to be correlated with a worse prognosis in this analysis. Individual radiation treatment planning and head fixation have a positive impact on survival. For postoperative radiotherapy of the posterior fossa, the application of head fixation and individual CT-based radiation treatment planning is considered indispensable in each case	
1	1526	[Evaluation of chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of rectal cancer]. [Review] [24 refs] [Japanese]	Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/dt [Drug Therapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Quality of Life, Radiotherapy, Rectal Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate	Chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of primary rectal cancers has been regarded as an effective adjuvant for surgical procedures. It has been expected to reduce local recurrence, increase the chance of sphincter-preserving operation and improve survival. However, recent advances in surgical technique for rectal cancers have reduced the local recurrence rate to no more than 10%, where the question may arise of whether adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is indeed necessary. Another matter to be elucidated is why adjuvant chemoradiotherapy does not necessarily improve overall survival for rectal cancers even when the local recurrence rate is reduced. In the treatment of locally recurrent lesions, either heavy ion radiotherapy or proton beam therapy is expected to be an effective alternative to the surgical procedure. [References: 24]

DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 consecutive incident cases were treated at the Biomedical Cyclotron Centre (Nice, France) from June 1991 to December 1997. Overall, metastasis-free, local recurrence-free, and enucleation-free survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 78.1% (SE: 3.7%). A largest basal tumor diameter (LTD) below 10 mm and female sex were independently associated with a better prognosis. The 5-year metastasis-free survival rate was 75.6% (SE: 3.6%). Only an LTD above 10 mm and ciliary body involvement were independently associated with metastasis. Ten patients (4.5%) had a local recurrence, which was correlated with the risk of metastasis (P =.045). The 5-year enucleation-free survival rate was 69.6% (SE: 4.0%). Once again, an LTD below 10 mm and female sex were predictive of a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our results with proton-beam therapy correspond to those reported in the literature. This treatment strategy is safe and yields predictably good results. In addition to the two independent prognostic factors for survival and metastasis, namely LTD and ciliary body involvement, sex also had a significant impact in our case series, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown

No abnormality was found in plain CT scan, but a ring-like enhanced mass was disclosed behind the right posterior clinoid process in enhanced CT scan. MRI revealed a low intensity mass in T1-weighted image and a ring-like enhanced mass in gadolinium-DTPA enhanced image. It was a circumferential high intensity mass in T2-weighted image and an isointensity mass in proton image. Cerebral angiography indicated that it was avascular. Preoperative diagnosis was trigeminal neurinoma or petroclival meningioma. The tumor was removed almost completely by orbitozygomatic infratemporal approach. Histologically, it was low grade chondrosarcoma. Postoperatively, neither radiation therapy nor chemotherapy was added. Differential diagnosis and treatment was discussed. It was suggested that MRI was the most useful diagnostic tool to distinguish chondrosarcoma from other skull base tumors

The glucose analog fluorine-18 fluorodeoxy-glucose(FDG) and amino acid analog 11C-L-methionine is the most commonly used PET tumor tracer. This time we compare with 1H-CSI and PET in gliomas and metastatic brain tumor with computer-assisted fusion images. We experienced some cases of the brain tumor. One case is metastatic brain tumor after radiation therapy, localized in right parietal hemisphere, with hemorrhage, and slightly accumulated Gd-DTPA in tumors. 11C-methionine PET demonstrates defects in tumors, but slight accumulated surrounding tumors. Accumulation of PET lesion is not elevated choline in CSI, but lactate is accumulated in tumors. Choline signal elevation seen in brain neoprasms, associated with increased cellular proliferation. Accumulation of PET and another accumulation of lactate in tumor are not demonstrate recurrence. Fusion image of PET and CSI is useful in understanding metabolism of brain tumor

Dose calculations in the body for treatment planning are converted to dose distributions in water, and the converted calculations are then generally evaluated by the dose measurements in water. In this paper, proton dose calculations were realized for a phantom simulating a clinical heterogeneity. Both dose calculations in the phantom calculated by two dose calculation methods, the range-modulated pencil beam algorithm (RMPBA) and the simplified Monte Carlo (SMC) method, and dose calculations converted to dose distributions in water by the same two methods were verified experimentally through comparison with measured distributions, respectively. For the RMPBA, though the converted calculations in water agreed moderately well with the measured ones, the calculated results in the actual phantom produced large errors. This meant that dose calculations in treatment planning should be evaluated by the dose measurements not in water but in the body with heterogeneity. On the other hand, the results calculated in the phantom, even by the less rigorous SMC method, reproduced the experimental ones well. This finding showed that actual dose distributions in the body should be predicted by the SMC method

Radiation therapy using a Rokus-M installation or a Saturn linear accelerator was performed in 26 cases, chemoradiation treatment--14 and cytostatic therapy alone--in 79 patients. Single focal dose used was 2 Gy, while total dose was as high as 51-70 Gy in cases receiving radiation alone and 35-40 Gy in the combined therapy group. Various combinations of carminomycin, bleomycin, cisplatinum, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil, allopurinol and cyclophosphamide were employed. Radiation and chemoradiation treatment proved effective in 67.5% of cases. Mean survival time for patients suffering primary cancer was 15.8 +/- 4.3 months, and for those with metastatic tumor--8.3 +/- 1.6 months. Remission was registered in 14, while stabilization--in 31 out of 79 patients who had received chemotherapy. The symptomatic effect was observed in 38%

Imbalance of components of the glucose-alanine cycle, expressed in hypoalaninemia and raised concentration of aminoacids with a bifurcated lateral chain, was detected against a background of marked hypercorticotropinemia and hypercorticolism. Single irradiation of the pituitary gland with a proton beam at absorbed doses of 100-120 Gy in the maximum of a deep field resulted in remission and normalization of aminograms of blood plasma (suggesting pathogenicity of proton-beam therapy) for 6-12 mos. The authors discussed probable mechanisms of the interrelationship of protein-amino-acid and carbohydrate metabolic derangements and their correlation with a type of changes in the hormonal balance

A high alpha 1-antitrypsin level and a normal alpha 2-macroglobulin level were found in all the breast cancer patients. An increase in both blood serum inhibitors was detected in hypophyseal adenoma. The dependence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin content on a subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spread was revealed in the course of 2 years following "hypophysectomy" in the patients with disseminated breast cancer. In the hypophyseal adenoma patients the activity of both inhibitors returned to normal 1 year after treatment and remained within normal during 3 years of follow-up. It was regarded as a positive therapeutic effect. The above findings make it possible to propose the determination of the activity af alpha 1-antitrypsin in breast cancer and alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in hypophyseal adenoma as an additional test for the evaluation of the results of proton "hypophysectomy"

The specific aim of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of proton beam radiation compared with current state-of-the art therapy in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Materials and METHODS: A Markov model was informed with cost, freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), and utility data obtained from the literature and from patient interviews to compare the cost effectiveness of 91.8 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) delivered with proton beam versus 81 CGE delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The length of how many years the model was run, patient's age, probability of FFBF after treatment with proton beam therapy and IMRT, utility of patients treated with salvage hormone therapy, and treatment cost were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Analysis at 15 years resulted in an expected mean cost of proton beam therapy and IMRT of $63,511 and $36,808, and $64,989 and $39,355 for a 70-year-old and 60-year-old man respectively, with quality-adjusted survival of 8.54 and 8.12 and 9.91 and 9.45 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to be $63,578/QALY for a 70-year-old man and $55,726/QALY for a 60-year-old man. CONCLUSION: Even when based on the unproven assumption that protons will permit a 10-Gy escalation of prostate dose compared with IMRT photons, proton beam therapy is not cost effective for most patients with prostate cancer using the commonly accepted standard of $50,000/QALY. Consideration should be given to limiting the number of proton facilities to allow comprehensive evaluation of this modality

This system was based on a Leksell stereotactic head frame and a Neptun 10p linear accelerator. We performed 624 radiosurgery treatments with this system between 1991 and 2000. Our objective was to increase the reliability of operation and to extend the applicability of our radiosurgery system. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We modified our stereotactic floor stand with specially designed adapter plates to make it compatible with the Mevatron KD and Neptun 10p linear accelerators and other stereotactic head frames (Riechert-Mundiger, CRW and BrainLab). We made a new tertiary collimator holder attachable to the Mevatron KD linac. The range of treatable cerebral lesion was increased from 10-30 mm to 5-42.5 mm with additional collimator inserts. With the above modifications our radiosurgery system is compatible simultaneously with the Neptun 10p and the Mevatron KD linear accelerators. This way we were able to increase the reliability of operation of the system, as the treatment can be performed with the Neptun 10p linac in case of breakdown of the Mevatron KD linac after fixation of the head frame to a patient's skull. RESULTS: The measured diameter of the radiation isocenter defined by the new radiosurgery collimator was less than 1 mm with the Mevatron KD linac. According to the Lutz-test the distance between the radiosurgery isocenter and the rotation axis of ZIV treatment table was less than 0.5 mm. Results of phantom test showed that the overall spatial precision of our modified radiosurgery system was better than 1.3 mm with Leksell head frame. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of experiences with 662 patients' radiosurgery treatments, the extension of our first cerebral radiosurgery system to Mevatron KD linear accelerator resulted in a more reliable operation. In accordance with our phantom tests the extension of the original system did not worsen its overall spatial precision

The mean age of patients was 37 years, the male/female ratio 1:1.1. The most frequent complaints were diplopia with oculomotor disorders (51%), headache (31%), and decreased hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus with statoacusticus dysfunction (21%). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 27 months. The chondrosarcomas were located in the petrosal bone in 37% (47 cases), in the occipital bone and clivus in 23% (30 cases), in the sphenoid bone in 20% (25 cases) and to a lesser extent in frontal, ethmoidal, and parietal bones (14%). In 6% (eight cases) the primary location was in dural tissue. Radiological examinations showed bone destruction and variable calcification (CT), involvement of neuronal and vascular structures (MRI), and mostly hypovascularity on angiography. On histological examination 51% of tumours were classified as grade I, 11% grade II, 30% mesenchymal, and 8% myxoid. The mesenchymal type was the most malignant as illustrated by a strong tendency to intradural and cerebral growth and possibly occurrence in younger age groups. The treatment of choice until recently was surgery because of the critical location and local aggressive nature. Regrowth of tumour after surgery occurred in 53% of the patients (average after 32 months). Charged particle irradiation gave a five year survival of 83-94% and a local control rate of 78%-91%. Both in surgery and radiotherapy there is treatment related morbidity and mortality that should be considered when offering these therapies. Recent promising results imply that charged particle radiotherapy, in combination with surgery, may be the therapeutical choice of the future. [References: 46]

[German]	Adolescent, Child, Combined Modality Therapy, Germany, Humans, Knowledge, Leukemia/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prospective Studies, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Registries, Retrospective Studies	BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is an integral component in the management of childhood malignancies and undergoes a continuous process of optimization within the prospective trials of the GPOH. At present there are approximately 20 active protocols, some specifying radio-oncological study questions, in which about 500 to 600 children annually are given radiotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Pediatric Radiation Oncology Working Group (APRO) of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) represents the organizational link between GPOH and DEGRO. Their activities range from phrasing guidelines of radio-oncological therapy, through writing a protocol for a prospective study on radiation-induced late effects (RISK--in co-operation with GPOH, 695 patients registered so far) and organizing meetings for information transfer, to implementing radio-oncology within the prospective studies of the GPOH by establishing study chairs for radio-oncology when radio-oncological questions are a primary focus and/or to function as a reference institution for quality assurance. These activities also include individual case consultations outside the study proper. Twice annually the members of the APRO meet for an update on current knowledge and future directions where a representative of the GPOH is invited to contribute special aspects of pediatric oncology. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, modern technology (intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, inclusion of imaging in treatment planning) will be part of disease management in pediatric oncology. A working group for modern radiotherapy technology was established to enhance this development. Prospective studies of the GPOH with primary or secondary radio-oncological questions require the implementation of corresponding tasks (documentation, monitoring, etc.) in order to meet future demands on clinical trials and to achieve the aims of the protocol. Consequently adequate financial support is indispensable

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients (48 lesions) and nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were applied in the carbon dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 gray equivalents (GyE) by a 10% increment and from 68.4 to 79.2GyE by a 5% increment, respectively. The radiation target consisted of primary tumor. Image analysis of the patients with local recurrence was systematically performed after the treatment by focusing attention on the enhanced thin slice CT images of the primary lesion. By superimposing the dose distribution on the planning CT image and marking the anatomically identified loci of recurrence, it was possible to establish the relationship between the dose distribution and the incipient loci of recurrence and to classify the recurrence patterns from the differences in the recurrence loci. RESULTS: Local recurrence was found in 19 (23.2%) out of a total of 82 lesions. It is possible to distinguish between three recurrence patterns: Pattern 1 representing marginal recurrence and patterns 2a and 2b, which are both instances of in-field recurrence. In pattern 1, four recurrences take place from a region on the upper tumor margin. In pattern 2a, 13 recurrences take place from the center of the tumor. In pattern 2b, two recurrences take place from the near-center of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: For the 15 in-field recurrence lesions (patterns 2a and 2b) after excluding the four marginal recurrence lesions (patterns 1), we have established that the local control shows dose-dependence. Based on this, we have determined the optimal therapeutic dose

Dosimetric factors are used for prediction of the occurrence of RP after XRT. Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CRT) is a promising modality because of its excellent dose localization and high biological effect on tumors. This study aims to analyze the relationship between dosimetric factors developed for XRT and the incidence of RP in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after CRT. We examined 80 inoperable patients with NSCLC. The ranges of the daily fraction sizes and the total doses were from 3.3 to 8.8 GyE and from 59.4 to 95.4 GyE, respectively. These doses were successfully delivered with acceptable toxicity; >or= grade 2 RP was observed in 8 patients (10%). The severity of RP was graded within 6 months of the initiation of CRT using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. These results indicate the excellent dose distribution of CRT. We then compared the dosimetric data of the 8 patients developed >or= grade 2 RP with those of 72 patients developed <or= grade 1 RP. Dosimetric factors useful for predicting RP in XRT, such as the percentage of the computed tomography-defined total lung volume receiving > 5, > 20, and > 30 GyE, and mean lung dose, were not predictive factors for RP after CRT. The dosimetric factors used for XRT are not applicable for CRT in patients with NSCLC. The dosimetric factors for CRT remain to be developed

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]	
1	1278	An intra-patient dose-escalation study of disodium pamidronate plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of osteolytic metastases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 42 patients with solitary lytic metastasis in weight-bearing bones were studied. Primary endpoints were the mean value and energy of gray-level histogram in plain radiographs (MVGLH and EGLH) and relative electron density (RED) of CT scans in bone lesions. In eleven patients (group A) the DP dose was increased stepwise from 90 up to 180 mg (flat dose), while in other 15 patients (group B) a flat dose of 180 mg was administered intravenously in 2 h. In both groups, the first session of DP was given concurrently with local radiotherapy (30 Gy in ten fractions, 5 days a week). Another 16 patients (group C) underwent radiotherapy only. RESULTS: Morbidity related to pamidronate was mild. Significant differences from the baseline (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) were recorded for MVGLH, EGLH and RED values, regarding all groups. Improvement was significantly higher in patients of group B versus A, while the results of pamidronate groups (A and B) were superior to group C, concerning the above indices (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, pamidronate groups had significantly lower skeletal morbidity than group C. CONCLUSION: The 2-h infusional flat dose of 180 mg every 4 weeks seems to be tolerable and superior to 90 mg regarding palliation and mainly recalcification of osteolytic lesions. Radiotherapy alone is effective but inferior to the combined treatment. Last but not least, the findings of MVGLH, EGLH and RED indicate an important increase in bone mass and bone formation, which was difficult to be identified visually by the experts

Treatment planning techniques involving therapeutic beam characteristics are described here. The vertical (140 MeV/u) and horizontal (170 MeV/u) carbon ion beams from the synchrotron at the NIRS were shaped, using the passive beam delivery system, to irradiate the target volume. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with a region of uniform HMV-I cell killing. The apertures and range compensators were designed for individual patients. A commercial treatment planning system, which was customized to our general carbon ion therapy, was tested for applicability to this treatment. Dose distributions were calculated with either a broad beam or a pencil beam algorithm using parameters determined by measurements and calculations. We evaluated the accuracy of the system software features, and replaced or added some other features to the software. The system was used for 12 patients during the past year. For nine patients two-port treatment was assessed to be more effective than mono-port therapy and these patients were treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs	
1	1227	Proton beam therapy with high-dose irradiation for superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Esophageal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: With the aim of improving the results of treatment for esophageal carcinoma, we have investigated the efficacy and toxicity associated with the use of a 250-MeV proton beam for radical radiation therapy in esophageal carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four patients with fully excised, Stage I breast cancer treated with adjuvant proton 3D-CPBI had treatment plans generated using the mixed-modality, photon-electron 3D-CPBI technique. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, planning target volumes (PTVs; lumpectomy site plus 1.5-2.0 cm margin) and prescribed dose (32 Gy) were held constant. Plans were optimized for PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Proton and mixed-modality plans both provided acceptable PTV coverage with 95% of the PTV receiving 90% of the prescribed dose in all cases. Both techniques also provided excellent dose homogeneity with a dose maximum exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose in only one case. Proton 3D-CPBI reduced the volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose by an average of 36%. Statistically significant reductions in the volume of total ipsilateral breast receiving 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the prescribed dose were also observed. The use of protons resulted in small, but statistically significant, reductions in the radiation dose delivered to 5%, 10%, and 20% of ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart. The nontarget breast tissue dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI were not dependent on tumor location, breast size, PTV size, or the ratio of PTV to breast volume. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to photon-electron 3D-CPBI, proton 3D-CPBI significantly reduces the volume of irradiated nontarget breast tissue. Both approaches to accelerated partial breast irradiation offer exceptional lung and heart sparing

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation

An intensity-controlled magnetic raster scanner together with a synchrotron allowing fast energy variation enable a unique method of purely active dose shaping in three dimensions. This contribution describes the necessary steps to establish a treatment planning system for this novel modality. We discuss the requirements for the physical beam model and the radiobiological model. Based on these we chose to implement a home-grown pencil beam model to describe the ion-tissue interaction and the Local Effect Model to calculate the RBE voxel-by-voxel. Given the large number of degrees of freedom biological dose optimization must be achieved by means of inverse treatment planning. All ion-related aspects are collected in our TRiP98 software. Biological dosimetry measuring cell survival in two dimensions turns out to be a good way to verify the model predictions as well as the actual irradiation procedure. We show a patient example and outline the future steps towards a dedicated clinic facility for all light ions

These include gamma units using cobalt-60; beams of protons, helium ions and neutrons; and modified cobalt-60 or linear accelerator units. These techniques allow delivery of a high dose of radiation in a single fraction to a small and well-defined intracranial volume, without delivering significant radiation to adjacent normal tissue. The most usual targets for radiosurgery are arteriovenous malformations. It is occasionally used for acoustic neuromas and primary or metastatic brain malignancies as well. Although radiosurgery is not a new procedure, its use is becoming more widespread. Nurses, as critical members of radiosurgery teams, must be informed about all aspects of the procedures and associated nursing care skills. [References: 7]

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

Physical selectivity and high relative biologic efficiency (RBE) represent the rationale for using ions in the treatment of tumours. The clinical results are very promising and justify the construction of new centres. We present the main characteristics of CNAO (Centro Nazionale Adroterapia Oncologica) and its possible integration in a nationwide network. The Italian project started in 1991 thanks to the activity of the TERA Foundation and was financed by the Italian Government in 2002. The CNAO will be built in Pavia to start clinical activity in 2007. The equipment will include a synchrotron and 3 treatment rooms mainly devoted to carbon ions but able to deliver also protons. The Centre should be able to deliver up to 20,000 fractions / year. The realization of CNAO is part of a more ambitious project to set up an integrated national network. The need of hadrontherapy centres is defined by epidemiological studies based on Italian tumour registries showing that almost 900 patients can be electively treated with protontherapy and about 10,000 could be included in clinical trials. Considering that ions could be used for radioresistant tumours that affect about 25,000 new patients/year, we estimate that 10-15%, i.e. 3000-4000 patients would benefit from ion therapy. The realization of a nationwide network possibly linked to a larger European network will be very helpful in making available hadrontherapy for a large part of the population

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We considered posterior-central, nasal, and temporal tumor locations, with straight, intrarotated, or extrarotated eye positions. Doses of 46 cobalt grey equivalent (CGE) to gross tumor volume (GTV) and 40 CGE to clinical target volume (CTV) (2 CGE per fraction) were assumed. Using three-dimensional planning, we compared isodose distributions for lateral, anterolateral oblique, and anteromedial oblique beams and dose-volume histograms of CTVs, GTVs, lens, lacrimal gland, bony orbit, and soft tissues. RESULTS: All beam arrangements fully covered GTVs and CTVs with optimal lens sparing. Only 15% of orbital bone received doses > or =20 CGE with a lateral beam, with 20-26 CGE delivered to two of three growth centers. The anterolateral oblique approach with an intrarotated eye resulted in additional reduction of bony volume and exposure of only one growth center. No appreciable dose was delivered to the contralateral eye, brain tissue, or pituitary gland. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy achieved homogeneous target coverage with true lens sparing. Doses to orbit structures, including bony growth centers, were minimized with different beam arrangements and eye positions. Proton therapy could reduce the risks of second malignancy and cosmetic and functional sequelae

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients treated between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients presented with locally recurrent (n = 17), T2 (n = 20), high-grade (n = 26), or incompletely resected tumors (n = 11). All patients underwent limbsparing surgery and IORT (median dose of 15 Gy) given either with high-dose-rate brachytherapy or a linear accelerator. 25 patients received additional EBRT with a mean of 50.6 Gy (range: 30.6-60 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-5.6 years). RESULTS: The 5-year overall and distant disease-free survival rates were 66% and 54%, respectively. The overall actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years is 16% (95% CI: 1%, 31%). The crude rate after 8 years is 18%. Surgical margin status, primary versus recurrent tumor and tumor stage did not show any statistically significant influence (univariate analysis) on local recurrence rates. Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas, IORT +/- EBRT after limb-preserving surgery achieves high local control rates. The risk of normal tissue toxicities is comparable to conventional limb-sparing treatment

A second set of lateral lasers was mounted approximately 20 cm below the isocentre allowing patient positioning at an ergonomical height. A small randomised study involving 16 heavy patients treated for pelvic malignancies demonstrated that using the lower lasers for patient set-up is not only likely to reduce strain on staff but also speed up the set-up process

The most common histological types are adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas and malignant mixed tumors. The results of conventional radiotherapy are suboptimal in inoperable or incompletely resected salivary gland tumors and in recurrent disease. The pooled data of some international series for low linear energy transfer radiation show a local control of 28%. Especially in advanced tumors neutron therapy can improve local control and should be the treatment of choice. The clinical data from different therapy centers in Europe show local control of 67% in gross disease. [References: 44]

BSRT is a description of an emerging radiation oncology procedure, where simulation, CT scan, treatment planning, and radiation treatment are synchronized with voluntary breath-hold, forced breath-hold, or breathing gating. The BSRT system consists of a breathing monitoring system (BMOS) and a linear accelerator gating hardware and software package. Two methods, a video camera-based method and the use of wraparound inductive plethysmography (RespiTrace), generate the BMOS signals. The BMOS signals and the synchronized fluoroscopic images are simultaneously recorded in the simulation room and are later analyzed to define the ideal treatment point (ITP) where organ motion is stationary. The BMOS signals at ITP can be used to gate a CT scanner or a linear accelerator to maintain the same organ configuration as in the simulation. The BSRT system allows breath-hold or gating. This dual role allows the system to be applicable for a variety of patients, i.e., the breath-hold method for those patients who can maintain and reproduce the ITP, and the forced breath-hold or gating method for those who are not ideal for voluntary breath-hold

After a 2 to 4 year follow-up, primary cancer was found to be controlled in 59 patients, a recurrence was noted in 16 patients but 12 patients had died without precise information concerning recurrence. We examined the correlation between recurrence and seven prognostic factors. Among these factors, the tumor volume, age, and the red blood corpuscle sedimentation rate showed a relatively strong correlation. A multivariable analysis (quantification methods II) was undertaken in order to integrate these prognostic factors and the score that was calculated from this analysis showed a strong correlation to local control. We believe that this score can be used for predicting recurrences and can be applied to the selection of patients for new treatments like hyperthermia or high LET irradiation

Because lupus erythematosus tumidus (LET) has rarely been documented in the literature and is often difficult to differentiate from other photodermatoses such as polymorphous light eruption, we performed photoprovocation tests in 60 patients with LET according to a standardized protocol. Areas of uninvolved skin on the upper back were irradiated with single doses of UV-A (100 J/cm2) and/or UV-B (1.5 minimal erythema dose) daily for three consecutive days. Interestingly, patients with LET are more photosensitive than those with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and in our study experimental phototesting revealed characteristic skin lesions in 43 patients (72%). Because of the latency period in developing positive phototest reactions, it might be difficult for these patients to link sun exposure with their skin lesions. Furthermore, our data revealed a positive correlation of antinuclear antibodies and positive provocative phototest reactions in these patients as seen for other forms of LE. In conclusion, the high incidence of positive phototest reactions in correlation with the clinical findings, history of photosensitivity and antinuclear antibodies enable the classification of LET as the most photosensitive type of LE

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival

This study examines the usefulness of portal MU subtraction in radiation therapy. For 11 prostate cancer patients treated with 23 MV photons, dose to prostate due to portal filming with 6 MV photons was determined. In all 11 patients subtraction of portal MU values from the actual treatment MUs resulted in a small underdosing of the prostate with an average treatment error of -0.5%. Portal filming without MU subtraction would cause small overdosing of the prostate with an average treatment error of 1.2%. The results of this study indicate that the benefits of portal MU subtraction are in doubt if (a) the energy of treatment x-rays is much higher than that of the portal x-rays and/or (b) when radiotherapy is performed with physical wedges. Based on the obtained results, we argue against unconditional use of the portal MU subtraction method to eliminate the dose from portal imaging

The new model was verified by comparing measured and calculated wedge factors for the standard set of wedge angles (i.e., 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees), different symmetric and asymmetric fields, and two different photon energies. The maximum difference between calculated and measured wedge factors is less than 2%. The average absolute difference is within 1%. The obtained results indicate that the suggested model can be useful for independent dose calculation with enhanced dynamic wedges

Clinical and dosimetric characteristics of a linear accelerator of this design that are distinguished by a high penetrating power, a high dose gradient along the beam edge, were studied in the Central Research Roentgeno-Radiological Institute. Its main distinctive feature is an ability to exercise programmed control over a depth dose field in the static and moving irradiation regimens by measuring the dose rate. Computed depth dose fields demonstrated an opportunity to use effectively the accelerator for irradiation of deep foci. Ten patients with head, chest and pelvic tumors were irradiated. Short-term positive results were obtained. Radiation complications hampering radiotherapy, were absent. The shortcomings are as follows: a small rotation angle of the irradiator, small movement rates of the diaphragm blocks and the adjustment of a light field, absence of a functionally fixed shaft. The accelerator has been shown to meet medical and technical requirements

A Komai stereotactic ring was used to locate the target coordinates. The patient was laid on the Linac treatment table and held in the head fixation system. Irradiation was given in five positions. The dose profile by film dosimetry and Rando phantom was satisfactory. Seventeen tumors in 14 patients were treated. Clinical or histological diagnoses were nine metastases, one benign and two malignant gliomas, one meningioma, and one craniopharyngioma. Tumor sizes were between 8 and 30 mm. Doses were between 12 and 30 Gy. Computed tomographic evaluation after 3 months of 12 tumors in 11 survivors showed one complete remission, three partial remission, six no change, and two partial deterioration. For progressive tumors, Linac radiosurgery results are excellent

This is obviously valid for conventional low linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiations when the dose contributions from various beam components are associated with the same relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value of unity. However, this is not the case for the new generation of charged particle beams whose RBEs have been shown to vary significantly with depth. A concept of effective dose, defined as the mathematical product of physical dose and RBE value evaluated for an effect level, is developed for the treatment planning of these high-LET particle radiations. Based on radiobiological results in mixed radiation experiments, it is shown that these effective doses are linearly additive like physical doses and hence, can be used directly for general treatment planning using linear algorithms already developed for the use of physical doses. This is illustrated using examples of simplified one-dimensional plans for the TRIUMF pion beam

Three fractions of 1.80 Gy, 4 h apart, were given on three treatment days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and the tumour dose was taken to 59.40 Gy in 33 fractions in 24-25 days. Acute mucosal reactions were generally quite severe, but a split was avoided by providing the patient with intensive support, often as an in-patient, until the reactions settled. Late radiation effects have been comparable to those obtained with conventional fractionation. The probability of local-regional control was 47% at 3 years for 69 previously untreated patients, whereas it was only 12% at one year for 20 patients treated for recurrence after radical surgery. Fifty-eight previously untreated patients with tumours arising in the upper aero-digestive tract were analysed in greater detail. The probability of local-regional control at 3 years was 78% for 17 Stage III patients and 15% for 31 Stage IV patients. This schedule of continuous AFRT is feasible and merits further investigation

A total of 39 evaluable patients were treated with curative intent using either fast neutrons alone or in combination with low LET irradiation as part of a mixed beam fractionation scheme. Actuarial survival curves are presented for both the "neutrons alone" and the "mixed beam" treatment groups. There was no significant survival difference between these groups of patients. The projected survival at two years is less than 10%, which is comparable with megavoltage photon results for an unselected series of patients. The size of the primary lesion and the initial Karnofsky performance status were found to be the most important prognostic indications for prolonged survival. Sixteen of 39 patients were felt to have achieved local clearance of their tumor at some time during their follow-up with the median time until a local recurrence being 17 months. Treatment related complications and patterns of metastatic spread are discussed. In general, it appeared that the response of large tumors to neutron irradiation resulted in necrosis and fistula formation. In many cases this was accompanied by persistent/recurrent tumor within the high dose radiation volume

The results based on 84 treatments indicate that average monthly doses in the range 12-19 mrem can be expected for 30 daily treatments similar to those monitored. It was also found that 76% of the in-room dose was due to activated components in the treatment head, the balance of the in-room dose being due to activated concrete. Other statistics were obtained on patient in-room times and technologist times and doses outside the treatment room. Although the monthly film dosimetry records show no detectable doses for technologists working with these particular machines, in the spirit of ALARA, steps have been taken to reduce residual activities even further by choice of material less susceptible to activation

The spectrum of therapeutic modalities is limited. The renaissance of the use of (224)Ra-radium chloride for AS treatment, however, gives rise to concern which should result in the reconsideration of (224)Ra dosimetry and in the discussion of the risks associated with this treatment. The present study introduces new dosimetric calculations for alpha and beta/gamma rays performed according to the model proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). After a treatment schedule of 10 intravenous injections, each with 1 MBq of (224)Ra, the absorbed doses were calculated to be highest on the bone surface of the patient (4.4 Gy) with a resulting effective dose of 2.5 Sv

METHODS: Blood from 4 healthy donors was irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays and the dose response of induced micronuclei in binucleate lymphocytes following cytokinesis block was determined. Micronucleus frequency was ascertained before and at intervals during radiotherapy treatment in 6 patients with various tumors in the pelvic region. Equivalent whole body doses (physical doses) at these times were calculated from radiation treatment plans and cumulative dose volume histograms. RESULTS: Linear dose response relationships were found for induced micronucleus frequency in lymphocytes resulting from both in-vitro and in-vivo irradiation. Doses resulting from in-vivo irradiation (biological doses) were estimated by substitution of micronucleus frequency observed in radiotherapy patients into the dose response curve from in-vitro irradiation of blood. The relationship between the biologically estimated dose (BD) and the calculated equivalent whole body dose (PD) was BD = 0.868 (+/- 0.043)PD + 0.117 (+/- 0.075). CONCLUSION: The micronucleus assay appears to offer a reliable and consistent method for equivalent whole body radiation dose estimation, although our findings should be confirmed using lymphocytes from radiotherapy patients with tumors at anatomical sites other than the pelvis. Except at doses lower than about ).4 Gy, the method yields dose estimates acceptably close to "true" physically determined doses. The assay can be performed relatively rapidly and can be used as a "first line" biological dosimeter in situations where accidental exposure to relatively high radiation doses has occurred	
1	4654	Update on radiation therapy in prostate cancer. [Review] [88 refs]	Brachytherapy, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Patient Selection, Patients, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time	Higher doses of radiation result in improved clinical control of prostate cancer,and the recent advances in prostate cancer radiotherapy are designed to escalate dose while minimizing toxicity. To achieve this goal, tighter treatment margins are needed, which require more accurate delineation of the prostate target and normal tissue at the time of treatment planning and before actual daily treatments. Modem radiation therapy techniques can deposit conformal dose virtually anywhere in the body; however, this precise therapy is of no value if it is not accurately hitting the target. Whether dose escalation is achieved by external beam techniques (eg, IMRT, protons) or brachytherapy, these ba-sic planning and delivery considerations are essentially the same. Future directions in prostate radiation therapy will use even higher radiation doses,alternative fractionation patterns, intraprostatic targets (eg, prostate tumor seen on MRI), and improved patient selection regarding which patients will benefit the most from these advanced techniques.

1	1986	Comparison of proton therapy and conformal X-ray therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)	Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Physics, Planning Techniques, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Research, Risk, X-Ray Therapy	This study compares the performance of one proton and four conformal X-ray planning techniques in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

METHODS: Thirty patients previously treated for intracranial lesions with the BrainLAB mMLC underwent retrospective replanning. Three collimator optimization strategies were compared for a simulated SRS treatment plan, as follows: Strategy 1, static collimation fixed at 90 degrees throughout arcs; Strategy 2, static collimator settings optimized for each arc; and Strategy 3, dynamic collimator settings optimized every 10 degrees throughout treatment arcs. Dose-volume histograms for a 0.7-cm shell of healthy peritumoral tissue were quantitatively compared. Collimator optimization schemes (Strategies 2 and 3) significantly decreased the volume of peritumoral tissue that is irradiated when compared with static collimation at 90 degrees (Strategy 1). The volume was reduced by 40.6% for Strategy 2 (95% confidence interval [CI] +/- 11) and by 47.1% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 8.1) at the 95% isodose; by 28.4% for Strategy 2 (95% CI +/- 4.9) and 39.1% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 6) at the 90% isodose; and by 18.2% for Strategy 2 (95% CI +/- 8.1) and 25.4% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 7.1) at the 80% isodose. Serial collimator optimization throughout the treatment arcs (Strategy 3) reduced the mean volume of peritumoral tissue irradiated when compared with static collimator optimization (Strategy 2), by 16.1% (95% CI +/- 1.5) at 95% isodose, by 11.7% (95% CI +/- 1) at 90% isodose, and by 8.2% (95% CI +/- 1.2) at 80% isodose regions. In specific cases, linear or polynomial functions were formulated to optimize collimator settings dynamically throughout treatment arcs. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic collimator optimization during arc-based SRS decreases the volume of healthy peritumoral tissue treated with high doses of radiation and appears to be an effective method of improving target conformality. This study is the first step toward determination of a smoothing function algorithm to allow for true dynamic collimation during SRS

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. RESULTS: In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors	
1	3370	A comparison of proton and megavoltage X-ray treatment planning for prostate cancer	Humans, Male, Patient Selection, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectum, Research, X-Ray Therapy	Conformal photon and proton therapy plans for prostate cancer have been compared in an attempt to quantify the potential advantages of using protons. Two X-ray plans (3-field, 6-field) and a 2-field proton plan were made and compared for each of 20 T3 prostate patients with the aid of the 3D planning system VOXELPLAN. Dose distributions were analysed in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVH). Tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were computed using our own and the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models, respectively. The study shows that on average the proton technique results in the best dose distribution, giving the lowest rectal complication probability, and also that the 3-field X-ray technique is more effective than the 6-field X-ray technique in sparing the rectum. At 5% rectal NTCP, the predicted proton average TCP for the 20 patients is 2% (in absolute terms) greater than that obtained using 3-field X-ray therapy. For 7 of the patients the gain in TCP is more than 3%. For the same rectal NTCP as the 3-field X-ray plan with a 64 Gy mean target dose, the use of protons increases the TCP by 2% on average, but for 5 of the patients the increases are greater than 4%. The result is in general positive towards the use of protons but a few patients do not benefit from it and this indicates the importance of patient selection for maximum clinical benefit

We measured chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes before, during, and after radiotherapy, using the techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chemically induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC). Twenty-two lung cancer patients treated at HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) entered the study and signed an informed consent. Frequencies of lymphocytes with chromosomal aberrations at the end of carbon-ion therapy varied among the patients. This frequency was significantly correlated to the radiation field size and weakly correlated to the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes during the treatment. As a result, we have found that chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients treated for lung cancer by carbon-ions were dependent on target volume, possibly reflecting the increased involvement of lymph nodes in the target field	
1	6	Proton beam therapy for posterior pole circumscribed choroidal haemangioma	Adult, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hemangioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology]	BACKGROUND: Macular and juxtapapillary circumscribed choroidal haemangiomas (CCH) have always posed a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

Sixty-one radiation and 97 surgical ovarian ablations, performed from 1972 to 1977, were assessed. Rigid criteria were used to classify response. Over-all response was similar for the surgical and irradiation groups. Survival from the time of ovarian ablation was greater in both groups in those who responded positively than in those who did not. Factors other than estrogen receptor status can determine the response of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast to ovarian ablation. These include the disease-free interval, menopausal status, weight and the presence of skeletal or ovarian metastases. The results indicate that clinical determinates and not the efficiency of one method over the other should be the main criteria for choosing between ovarian ablation by irradiation or by oophorectomy

[French]	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/td [Trends], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	We began intracranial stereotactic irradiation under the direction of O Betti 11 years ago. At the present time, we believe it is interesting to present the methodologies of the SALT (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon) group. Up to the present time we have irradiated 693 patients using a single fraction. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represented the majority (90%) of treated lesions. Irradiation protocol has little changed since 1986, and the localization of the target volume was performed in the neurosurgery department of St Anne Hospital, France. The stereotactic images (computerized tomography [CT], angiography) were sent to the radiotherapy department of Tenon Hospital through the French public digital network NUMERIS. Protocol was realized using the stereotactic ARTEMIS-3D/Dosigray TPS. The lesion volume was filled by one or more spherical or elliptical subvolumes using the "Associated Target Methodology". The interactive adjustment of subvolumes was based on the 3D graphical representations of the lesion. The direct optimization of the irradiation space was performed by managing parameters provided by the DDB (Dosimetric Data Base) such as the number of arcs, their angular position, as well as the starting and the ending point of each arc. The evaluation of the calculated dose distribution was made using quantitative parameters. The second method of optimization was based on the minibeam intensity modulation using a mathematical theory of inverse problems and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. At the present time, due to technical reasons, linear accelerators do not permit the modulation of intensity of arctherapy. Thus we transformed the profiles of irregular forms into rectangular profiles of modulated ponderation, with each optimized plan being evaluated before its implementation. The criteria of evaluation were derived from the differential and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH). The DVHs permitted the evaluation of the volumes of underdosage and overdosage inside the lesion and in the healthy tissue, respectively. Using DVHs, we have defined parameters such as the conform factor and the homogeneity index. We stress that the methodology of protocol optimization is valid for single or multiple fractions as well as for intra- and extra-cranial irradiation

A progressive reduction in glandular volume (of low, medium, and high grade) was observed in 48/50 patients respectively within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and 6-9 months after treatment. After 9 months only lesser modifications were observed. A statistically significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between volume decrease percentage and histologic grading of the tumor, but not with its stage. Within the groups of patients affected with similar-grade neoplasms, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) was observed, relative to the decrease rate of prostatic volume, between the patients with complete response and those with partial or no response. US monitoring of prostatic volume after radiotherapy, if correlated with histologic grading, can yield early predictive elements as to treatment outcome, thus contributing to select non-responsive patients to submit to biopsy and, if necessary, to therapeutic alternatives or combinations. Longer-term studies are needed to prove its effectiveness, to prognostic purposes, in the single patient

Dose-effect relationships were obtained for each child by taking blood at different times during exposure. In vitro dose-effect relationships for chromosome aberrations in children and adults were obtained by exposing blood under the same conditions as the children. Exposure in vivo and in vitro yielded similar linear-quadratic dose-effect relationships for dicentric aberrations. The response in vitro was slightly greater than in vivo, but the difference was not very large. It is concluded that the dose-effect relationship for dicentric chromosome aberrations obtained in vitro for adults can be used for biological dosimetry in irradiated children. Some of the children displayed a high number of "rogue cells" before exposure; this may be due to the malignant disease as it was not found in the healthy controls

Basing on the measurement of the prostate in 3 directions in patients with different stages of disease (T1-2-24, T3-29 and T4-20), a conclusion was made that a prostate size was not enough to determine a stage of disease though a tendency to an increase in prostate size corresponded to the growing T index. However, stages T1-2 and T4 could be determined for sure within a certain range of prostate size values

The positions of markers, recognizable on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images, at known locations on the skin of a patient's head are related to the site of the lesion seen on the images. The markers' positions are determined by a BSM device, incorporating six video cameras coupled to a computer. A transformation from a coordinate system, defined by the CT or MR images, to another coordinate system, that of the BSM device, allows the proton beam to be directed towards the lesion. Markers used in this work were solid steel spheres for CT and plastic spheres containing oil for MR images

It is characterized by high signal on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Radiation-induced endothelial cell damage resulting in blood-nerve barrier breakdown is hypothesized to produce this pattern, but histologic evidence of this in the optic nerve is lacking. We attempted to evaluate the effect of radiation on endothelial cells in the optic nerve. DESIGN: Case-controlled histologic study. METHODS: We studied the optic nerves of 16 enucleated eyes from patients with uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation, 6 from normal eyes and 5 from eyes with unirradiated uveal melanomas. Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) lectin was used to identify endothelial cells in single paraffin sections. Transverse and longitudinal sections of vessels were counted in masked fashion. RESULTS: There were 49.4+/-6.9 transversely sectioned endothelial cells per millimeter of nerve in 6 optic nerves exposed to 0 to 1000 cGyE ("low-dose") compared with 17.3+/-5.3 in 10 nerves exposed to 5500 to 7000 cGyE ("high-dose") (P = 0.002). Longitudinally sectioned vessels stained with UEA-I were separately identified, with 11.5+/-2.1 in the low-dose group and 5.6+/-1.6 in the high-dose group (P = 0.044). The thickness and staining of the endothelial cell layer appeared greater in the high-dose group. Endothelial cell counts did not correlate with age, gender, acuity, or interval after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased radiation dosage to the optic nerve correlates with smaller numbers of endothelial cells	
1	1642	The rush to judgment: Does the evidence support the enthusiasm over three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and dose escalation in the treatment of prostate cancer?.[see comment].

METHODS: We first define 3D-CRT in comparison to standard radiation therapy and discuss the assumptions on which the technology of 3D-CRT and dose escalation are based. We then examine the evidence on the benefits and limitations from the current most commonly cited studies on dose-escalation trials to treat prostate cancer. RESULTS: The assumption that 3D-CRT can provide a tighter margin around the tumor area to allow for dose escalation is not yet proven by studies that show continual difficulty in defining the planning treatment volume because of extrinsic and intrinsic difficulties, such as imaging variabilities and patient and organ movement. Current short-term dose-escalation studies on the use of 3D-CRT to treat prostate cancer are limited in their ability to prove that increasing dose improves survival and does not incur potential long-term complications to normal tissue. CONCLUSION: Although 3D-CRT is a promising technology that many radiation oncologists and clinics are quickly adopting to treat such tumors as prostate cancer, the long-term evidence on the benefits and limitations of this technology is still lacking. Until we have solid long-term evidence on the true clinical potential of this new technology, let us not rush to judgment, but exercise caution, diligence, and thoughtfulness in using this new technology to treat our patients.

This paper describes the procedures for selection of patients, the treatment protocol, and the neurological and neuroradiological responses to stereotactic radiosurgery in this age group. The volumes of the treated AVMs ranged from 265 mm3 to 60,000 mm3. The results are favorable: thus far, 20 of 25 patients have experienced greater than or equal to 50% obliteration of their AVMs within 1 year after treatment, and 14 of 18 patients have experienced total obliteration of the AVM by 2 years after treatment. Two patients hemorrhaged from radiosurgically treated AVMs within 12 months after treatment, but none thereafter. Complications include vasogenic edema and arterial occlusion; three patients have had neurological worsening as definite or possible sequelae of treatment. The strengths and limitations of the method are discussed

In the great majority of the 475 patients treated for pituitary tumors, marked and sustained biochemical and clinical improvement was observed. Variable degrees of hypopituitarism developed in about one-third of patients treated solely with radiosurgery. In the earlier years of the program, 365 patients underwent radiosurgery to treat selected systemic diseases by inducing hypopituitarism. Focal temporal lobe necrosis and cranial nerve injury occurred in about 1% of patients who were treated with doses less than 230 Gy	
0	3397	Computed tomography slice-by-slice target-volume delineation for stereotactic proton irradiation of large intracranial arteriovenous malformations: an iterative approach using angiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging	Angiography, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Angiography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Methods, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: Target-volume delineation for stereotactic irradiation is problematic for large and irregularly shaped arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The purpose of this report is to quantify modifications in the target volume that result from iterative treatment planning that incorporates multimodality imaging data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stereotactic neuroimaging procedures were performed for 20 consecutive patients with AVM volumes > 10 cm3. Angiographically defined extrema were transformed into computed tomography (CT) space. The resulting target contours were then modified by a multidisciplinary treatment planning team after iterative review of angiographic, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Volumes of interest and dose-volume histograms for proton irradiation were calculated before and after iterative target delineation. RESULTS: Initial (angiographically defined) target volumes ranged from 15.3 to 96.1 cm3 (mean, 43.6 cm3). Final (iteratively defined) target volumes ranged from 10.7 to 114.0 cm3 (mean, 38.4 cm3). The volume of presumed normal tissue excluded by iterative planning ranged from 2.6 to 47.0 cm3 (mean, 15.5 cm3). Initially untargeted AVM, most commonly obscured by embolization material, was identified in all cases (range, 0.3 to 57.8 cm3; mean, 10.3 cm3). Corresponding dose-volume histograms demonstrated marked differences regarding lesion coverage and sparing of normal tissue structures. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative target-volume delineation resulted in significant modifications from initial, angiographically defined target volumes. Substantial amounts of apparently normal tissue were excluded from the final target, and additional abnormal vascular structures were identified for incorporation. We conclude that an iterative multimodality approach to target-volume delineation may improve the overall results for stereotactic irradiation of large and complex AVMs	
1	1991	Stereotactic radiosurgery--the role of charged particles. [Review] [21 refs]	Biomedical Research, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], California, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Macular Degeneration/su [Surgery], Pituitary Gland/su [Surgery], Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Universities	Stereotactic radiosurgery using charged-particle beams has been the subject of biomedical research and clinical development for more than 50 years. Charged particles of proton mass or greater manifest unique physical properties that can be used to place a high dose of radiation preferentially within the boundaries of a deeply located intracranial target volume. Since 1954, nearly 10000 patients have been treated using this technique. Treated disorders include pituitary tumors, vascular malformations, primary and metastatic brain tumors, and subfoveal neovascularization. Charged-particle radiosurgery is particularly advantageous for the conformal treatment of large and/or irregularly shaped lesions, or for the treatment of lesions located in front of or adjacent to sensitive brain structures.

METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention

The long term success of the treatment, however, is severely limited by restenosis. Recently, different investigators have begun to study the possibility of radiation therapy in restenosis prevention and have shown promising results. However, an optimal radiation delivery device for delivering a highly localized radiation dose to the arterial medial layer while preserving the viability of the artery has yet to be established. In this article, we discuss the development of a unique mixed gamma/beta brachytherapy source capable of delivering high radiation dose to a 0.5 mm thick vessel wall by proton-beam activating an existing nickel titanium stent to produce vanadium-48. The dose distribution of the activated stent is determined by computer simulation using MCNP Monte Carlo code and is verified by radiochromic film measurement

We developed an efficient leaf sequencing method to eliminate leaf end abutment for segmental IMRT delivery. Our method uses simple matrix and sorting operations to obtain a solution that simultaneously minimizes total monitor units and number of segments without leaf end abutment between segments. We implemented and demonstrated our method for multiple clinical cases. We compared the results of our method with the results from exhaustive search method. We found that our solution without leaf end abutment produced equivalent results to the unconstrained solutions in terms of minimum total monitor units and minimum number of leaf segments. We conclude that the leaf end abutment fields can be avoided without affecting the efficiency of segmental IMRT delivery. The major strength of our method is its simplicity and high computing speed. This potentially provides a useful means for generating segmental IMRT fields that require high spatial resolution or complex intensity distributions

Based on the microdosimetric specific energy spectrum in cell nuclei, a model to evaluate the biological effect induced by the internally emitted particles from a beta-delayed particle decay beam has been developed. In this paper, using this model the additional contributions to the cell-killing effect due to the emitted particles from stopping 9C ions were incorporated in the design of spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBP) for radioactive 9C beams. For this purpose, a simulated annealing algorithm was employed to optimize the superposing weighting fractions of all monoenergetic beams so that a uniform cell survival level could be realized across the SOBP within an acceptable deviation of 5%. SOBPs with different widths and at different cell survival levels were designed for both therapeutic 9C and 12C beams for comparison. The potential use of the 9C beam in radiotherapy compared to the 12C beam, which is commonly adopted in the practices of current heavy-ion therapy, is shown systematically in terms of the distributions of biological effective dose and cell survival along the beam penetration

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1066-1070

OBJECTIVE: To compare various methods of modeling the relationship between tumor dimension and metastatic death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1204 patients with primary choroidal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between January 1985 and December 1998. Largest basal diameter and largest perpendicular basal diameter were recorded at the time of surgical placement of tantalum rings used for tumor localization during proton treatment. The height of the tumor and the axial diameter of the eye were measured by ultrasonography prior to treatment. Using proportional hazards regression, we compared the prognostic influence of different indices of tumor size with estimated risk ratios and death rates according to tumor basal area and largest basal diameter. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up annually through June 30, 2000. Of the 1204 patients analyzed, 193 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up among survivors was 7.9 years. The 5- and 10-year metastatic death rates were 12.8% and 20.7%, respectively. Among various approaches for modeling tumor dimension, the logarithm of tumor basal area had the highest log-likelihood and performed better than other approaches in 85% of the simulations. Based on this model, the covariate-adjusted rate ratio for any doubling in tumor basal area was 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.28). CONCLUSION: Tumor basal area is a better prognostic indicator than largest tumor diameter and tumor volume in the prediction of metastatic death after proton beam irradiation for uveal melanoma

In spite of the most aggressive therapies, the control of metastatic prostate cancer remains an elusive objective and many patients die of secondary disease. Targeted alpha-therapy is an emerging therapeutic modality whereby a labeled protein selectively targets cancer cells and delivers a lethal payload, which can kill cancer cells in transit or preangiogenic cell clusters. Recent studies show that targeted alpha-therapy is highly cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells in vitro and can inhibit tumor growth in animal models. This review will consider alpha-emitting radionuclides and current in vitro and in vivo studies with alpha-radioconjugates, and will focus on cell-surface target antigens and targeting vectors for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck is a criterion of treatment for these patients. But some authors suggest to prophylactically irradiate the the whole neck. This study was to analyze and compare long-term outcomes of the N0-NPC patients treated by prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck and to the whole neck, and explore radiotherapy on neck for N0-NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 178 N0-NPC patients, proved by pathology, were treated in our hospital from Jul. 1998 to Dec. 1999. Of the 178 patients, 88 received prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck (upper neck group), 90 received prophylactic irradiation to the whole neck (whole neck group). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze and compare survival rate of the 2 groups. Cox model was used to study prognostic factors of N0-NPC. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 90.9%, and 80.7% in upper neck group, and 97.8%, 80.0%, and 71.1% in whole neck group (P = 0.224). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 93.2%, 80.7%, and 77.3% in upper neck group, and 85.6%, 68.9%, and 64.4% in whole neck group (P = 0.163). The incidence of cervical lymph nodes recurrence was 1.14% in upper neck group, and 1.09% in whole neck group (P> 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, and short-term outcome were independent prognostic factors of N0-NPC. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic irradiation to upper neck is recommended for N0-NPC patients

The treatment is delivered using a carefully calibrated 10 MV machine and the Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW) system. The precision of the method as well as its quality assurance is described. Eight patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) received irradiation from August 1990 to November 1991. The prescribed dose at the periphery of the AVM was 8 Gy per session, with six patients receiving two sessions and two patients receiving one session. The field size, encompassing the 90% isodose, ranged from 20 mm to 35 mm. In four patients, follow-up angiography was performed one year after the full course of therapy; total obliteration of the AVM was noted in three (75%) with a partial response in the other. In the other four patients, follow-up angiography was not performed; one patient, who had only one session of irradiation, experienced rebleeding six months later and died, and the other three patients had no further episodes of bleeding during their follow-up of 28, 18 and 14 months, respectively. Linear accelerator-based stereotactic focal radiotherapy can attain a precisely defined and reproducible dose distribution. The effects of this treatment may take one to two years to develop. Our preliminary study suggests that it is an effective alternative treatment for surgically inaccessible lesions. Patients with a small cavernous sinus dural AVM appear to have a better and more rapid response. [References: 18]

We demonstrate the clinical value of MR spectroscopy in monitoring chemotherapy in a patient with recurrent glioma after stereotactic radiotherapy. Diagnostic imaging before and after chemotherapy included contrast-enhanced MRI, single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H MRS), (1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ((1)H SI), and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET). A significant decrease in choline signal intensity was observed 2 months after chemotherapy indicating tumour chemosensitivity, in line with tumour shrinkage on MRI and decreased uptake of FDG. Assessment of early response by MRS may help to improve treatment protocols in other patients

Thirty-four patients with histologically proven astrocytoma WHO II-IV after treatment by FSRT and a new suspect lesion in the follow-up were included in this study. Data were analysed by three independent radiologists with different experience in 1H SI: Data were verified by clinical follow-up (PT, progressive tumour; nPT, non-progressive tumour) and a kappa analysis was performed. Sensitivity and specificity of T1 weighted (w) and T2w MRI was compared (imaging at radiotherapy and follow-up) using further follow-up controls as gold standard and the additional benefit of 1H SI (imaging at follow-up) was calculated. Mean interval between last irradiation and detection of a suspicious lesion was 37 +/- 32 months. Time to clinical evaluation was 13 +/- 8 months. Interobserver agreement was significantly high in all analyses (kappa always >0.8, P < 0.05). T2w imaging proved to be superior to contrast enhanced T1w imaging in sensitivity (87.5 vs 81.25%) and specificity (85.7 vs 57.1%). Solitary 1H SI had similar results as T2w (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 71.4%). Taking all techniques into account, all PT were correctly diagnosed. Radiologists' experience had no significant influence on correct interpretation of a suspicious lesion. We conclude that 1H SI is helpful in characterising new suspicious lesions in irradiated gliomas, particularly if pre-MRI is not available for evaluating follow-up

Threshold values to indicate the probability of a progressive tumor were also calculated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with histologically proven gliomas showing a suspicious brain lesion in MRI after stereotactic radiotherapy were evaluated on a 1.5 Tesla unit (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using 2D proton MRSI (repetition time/echo time = 1500/135 msec, PRESS; voxel size 9 x 9 x 15 mm (3)). A total of 274 spectra were analyzed (92 voxel were localized within the suspicious brain lesion). Relative signal intensities Cho, Cr and NAA were measured and their ability to discern between PT and nPT was assessed using the linear discrimination method, logistic regression, and the cross-validation method. PT and nPT were differentiated between on the basis of clinical course and follow-up by MRI, CT and positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The Cho parameter and the relative signal intensity ratios of Cr and NAA were most effective in differentiating between PT and nPT. The logistic regression method using the parameter ln(Cho/Cr) and ln(Cho/NAA) had the best predictive results in cross-validation. A sensitivity of 93.8 % and specificity of 85.7 % were achieved in the differentiation of PT from nPT by proton-MRSI. CONCLUSION: (1)H-MRSI has a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between therapy-related effects and the relapse of irradiated gliomas. This method allows for assessment of the probability of radiotherapy response or failure

In the United States, POHS is an important cause of loss of central visual acuity in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years. A number of treatment options for subfoveal and juxtafoveal CNVMs in POHS have been under investigation, including laser photocoagulation, surgical excision of the CNVM, and radiation therapy. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old women was referred to our office reporting decreased depth perception and finger-counting vision in the right eye for the duration of 1 month. A diagnosis of POHS with subfoveal CNVM was made and the patient was referred for an experimental protocol of proton-beam irradiation. Four months after her initial visit, the patient returned, reporting blurry vision with a blind spot in her left eye. A subfoveal CNVM in the left eye was subsequently treated with irradiation as well. Seven months after the initial treatment, visual acuities were 20/20 in each treated eye. CONCLUSION: Although is currently an experimental procedure, proton-beam irradiation appears to be a promising treatment for subfoveal CNVM in patients with POHS

We report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery in nine patients with ten glomus tumors. All patients were treated either with frame based LINAC or Cyberknife with doses ranging from 1600 cGy to 2500 cGy. Three patients received no previous therapy and one patient received additional external beam radiation for concomitant treatment of carotid body tumors. Patients were then followed for post treatment side effects in addition to change in tumor size by MRI evaluation. The median clinical follow-up time was 26 months (mean 54 months), median radiographic follow-up was 21.5 months (mean 46 months), with a range from 3 to 126 months. The results from our center demonstrated nine of ten tumors to be stable in size by MRI exam, and one tumor which regressed in size.

1	988	Efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Cranial Nerve Diseases/et [Etiology], Cranial Nerve Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Cranial Nerve Injuries/et [Etiology], Databases,Factual, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glomus Jugulare Tumor/co [Complications], Glomus Jugulare Tumor/su [Surgery], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Multiple Primary/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Complications/ep [Epidemiology], Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Safety	OBJECT: Since the mid-1990s the use of radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors has grown in popularity. Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings continue to support radiosurgery as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors that results in low rates of morbidity	
1	1996	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: repeat treatment with conformal proton therapy--dose-volume histogram analysis	Adult, Aged, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	PURPOSE: To analyze control, survival, and complication rates of conformal proton radiation for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated	
1	1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses	
0	3407	Influence of microdosimetric quantities on observed dose-response relationships in radiation therapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Photons, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Sweden, Weights and Measures	The steepness of dose-response curves in radiation therapy depends to a large extent on the statistics of cell killing. This is so if the last few clonogenic tumor cells have to be hit or eradicated by other means to cure the patient. The steepness is dependent on the number of clonogenic cells in the tumor and the possible variation in their sensitivity. However, the uniformity of the dose distribution is also important and a decreased slope may result when the delivery of the dose is nonuniform or statistically uncertain. The variance in the energy imparted at the microdosimetric level to individual cell nuclei constitutes the ultimate limit of the variance in delivered dose at a given mean tumor dose. Considering all dosimetric variances it is shown that for low-LET beams the conventional microdosimetric variance will dominate, while in neutron and high-LET beams in general the microdosimetric variance may contribute significantly to the observed dose-response relationship. As a result the normalized slope of the dose-response curve for tumor control and normal tissue complications with neutrons and other high-LET beams will be reduced compared to that with photons. This conclusion is found to be in quantitative agreement with available data from clinical trials with neutron therapy. Finally, it is pointed out that for beams with a very high RBE and LET it may be favorable to deliver a fraction of the total dose in the form of conventional low-LET radiation. This addition of low-LET radiation may be desirable to ensure a dose to all clonogenic tumor cell nuclei that is sufficiently high and uniform to achieve a high probability of tumor control

Ten patients were irradiated after a radical thymectomy, three after partial resection and eleven after histologic diagnosis alone The patients were treated by different irradiation methods, mostly with the photons of a Co60 unit and a 43 MeV betatron. The average focal dose was 45 Gy which were administered within five weeks. The observation period was five years on an average. The general five year survival probability was 54%; some partial collectives were evaluated individually. These studies show that by unique radiotherapy, too, a two-year survival rate of 100% and a five-year survival rate of 50% as sell as a local recurrence rate of about 20% can be reached. Patients under fourty years with epithelial thymomas and a dose of less than 40 Gy have a less favorable prognosis. Compared to other authors, a relatively high rate of remote metastases was observed which necessitated extensive follow-up measures and suggests an adjuvant chemotherapy	
1	3410	Long-term results of helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Glaucoma,Neovascular/ep [Epidemiology], Helium, Humans, Ions, Melanoma, Melanoma/ep [Epidemiology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	Between 1978 and 1988, 307 patients with uveal melanoma were irradiated using helium ions at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The length of follow-up ranged from 1-115 months (median 42 months). The 5-year actuarial treatment results were: local control rate, 96.8%, determinate survival rate, 81%, freedom from distant metastases, 76%, eye retention rate, 83%, and risk of developing neovascular glaucoma, 36%. Long-term vision outcome was analyzed in 81 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Forty-seven percent of patients retained vision of 20/200 or better. The median change in vision was a loss of four lines on the standard eye chart. Thirty-eight percent of patients had visual acuity either improve or remain within two lines of their pretreatment vision. A multivariate analysis identified tumor size as the only independently significant risk factor affecting survival, development of neovascular glaucoma, or the risk of enucleation; no risk factor correlated with local recurrence. Tumor size, tumor-fovea distance, and pretreatment visual acuity were independently significant risk factors influencing vision outcome. These results confirm that helium ion irradiation is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma which combines high rates of local control, survival, and eye retention with a substantial likelihood of long-term vision preservation	
1	3412	Vision following helium ion radiotherapy of uveal melanoma: a Northern California Oncology Group study.[see comment]	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Helium, Humans, Ions, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	One hundred eighty-six uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium ion radiotherapy at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and followed for at least 6 months. (Follow-up times ranged from 6 to 90 months; median 26.4 months.) At last examination, 92 of 186 patients (49%) had visual acuity of 20/200 or better in the treated eye. Univariate statistical analysis revealed that post-treatment vision correlated with tumor size, distance between tumor and optic disc, distance between tumor and fovea, pretreatment visual acuity, dose delivered to the optic disc, and dose delivered to the fovea (p less than .05). Neither the maximum tumor dose nor site of tumor origin (ciliary body vs. choroid) correlated with post-treatment vision on a univariate basis. However, multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the strongest independent risk factors influencing vision outcome (p less than .05) were tumor size, pretreatment visual acuity, tumor-fovea distance, and maximum tumor dose. Neither the fovea dose nor the dose to optic disc appeared to significantly affect vision outcome when other variables were taken into account. These results suggest that post-treatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better can be achieved in one-half of uveal melanoma patients treated using helium ion irradiation. Several independent risk factors affecting vision outcome have been identified	
1	3413	Comparison of helium-ion radiation therapy and split-course megavoltage irradiation for unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Final report of a Northern California Oncology Group randomized prospective clinical trial	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Aged, Arm, California, Californium, Clinical Trials as Topic, Female, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Photons, Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Random Allocation, Research, Survival, Universities	Forty-nine patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the pancreas were treated in a randomized, prospective study comparing definitive helium ion radiation therapy with conventional split-course megavoltage photon irradiation. Patients in each treatment arm underwent exploratory staging laparotomy followed by concurrent radiation therapy and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Patients treated with photons received 6,000 cGy over a period of 10 weeks; patients treated with helium irradiation received a 6,000-7,000-cGy-equivalent dose over a period of 8-9 weeks. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients in the two treatment arms (P = .29). Patients treated with helium ions had a slightly longer median survival (7.8 months) than the photon-treated patients (6.5 months). Local control rates were slightly higher in the helium-treated patients (10% vs 5%). Complications included one chemotherapy-related death. Four of the five helium-treated patients who survived longer than 18 months died of local failure without distant metastases. These results suggest that more aggressive local therapy could result in improved survival in helium-treated patients	
1	3414	Neon ion radiotherapy: results of the phase I/II clinical trial	California, Californium, Cell Cycle, Drug Evaluation, Head, Humans, Ions, Lung, Male, Neck, Neon, Neon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oxygen, Prostate, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Retrospective Studies, Sarcoma, Survival, Survivors, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	Neon ion radiotherapy possesses biologic and physical advantages over megavoltage X rays. Biologically, the neon beam reduces the oxygen enhancement ratio and increases relative biological effectiveness. Cells irradiated by neon ions show less variation in cell-cycle related radiosensitivity and decreased repair of radiation injury. The physical behavior of heavy charged particles allows precise delivery of high radiation doses to tumors while minimizing irradiation of normal tissues. In 1979 a Phase I-II clinical trial was started at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory using neon ions to irradiate patients for whom conventional treatment modalities were ineffective. By the end of 1988 a total of 239 patients had received a minimum neon physical dose of 1000 cGy (median follow-up for survivors 32 months). Compared with historical results, the 5-year actuarial disease-specific survival (DSS5) and local control (LC5) rates suggest that neon treatment improves outcome for several types of tumors: a) advanced or recurrent macroscopic salivary gland carcinomas (DSS5 59%; LC5 61%); b) paranasal sinus tumors (DSS5 69%; LC5 69% for macroscopic disease); c) advanced soft tissue sarcomas (DSS5 56%, LC5 56% for macroscopic disease); d) macroscopic sarcomas of bone (DSS5 45%; LC5 59%); e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas (DSS5 90%; LC5 75%); and f) biliary tract carcinomas (DSS5 28%; LC5 44%). Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, lung, and advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer has been less successful; results for these tumors appear no better than those achieved with conventional x-ray therapy. These findings suggest that Phase III trials using the neon beam should be implemented for selected malignancies

Radiosurgery using the gamma knife is a non-invasive stereotactic neurosurgical procedure. Radiosurgery, as microsurgery, must be evaluated not only early, but also the late effect after the treatment some years. Evaluation of the results is therefore an ongoing process and results of the first year with the 5-year follow up are presented. At this time radiosurgery has a zero treatment mortality and the present morbidity with regard to the diagnosis 0-10%

All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma. Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation. The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed

Tumors of the same histology and TNM stage were compared after different treatments. Prior to this comparative study tumor volume changes and halving time were tested for judging the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment of 765 patients with lung metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor volume was determined by CT planimetry before and after radiotherapy in 56 tumor patients (42 lung tumors, 14 thyroid tumors). The rate of regression, i.e., the halving time was calculated on the basis of exponential curve. Fourteen thyroid tumor patients given telecobalt and photon irradiation for post-operative recurrence formed a separate group of patients. Halving time was determined at 30-day intervals, the values were qualified as "fast", "moderately fast", "moderately slow" and "slow". RESULTS: Partial remission rate of patients treated by telecobalt irradiation was not higher than 60%, accompanied by fast halving time. With those receiving photon irradiation, however, partial remission reached even 70%, also with a fast halving time. In both groups minimal remission was associated with moderately fast halving time. The partial remission of recurring thyroid tumor patients receiving telecobalt irradiation was partly fast, partly moderately fast. Their minimal remission data developed with a moderately fast halving time, although chemotherapy subsequent to radiotherapy did not result in regression. CONCLUSION: Appraisal of radiotherapeutic efficacy is based on the simultaneous monitoring of decrease in tumor volume (%) and halving time. It is to be stressed that neither the planimetric volume determination nor the halving time data can be taken as absolute values, since they are subject to other factors. In authors opinion, the most effective methods of the following of the tumor regression is the planimetric volume measurement calculated by CT, in the clinical praxis in recent time

Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the "stable" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness	
1	296	A knowledge-based imaging informatics approach for managing proton beam therapy of cancer patients	Brain/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Computational Biology, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Knowledge, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Patient Care Planning, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Research	The need for a unified patient-oriented information system to handle complex proton therapy (PT) imaging and informatics data during the course of patient treatment is becoming steadily apparent due to the ever increasing demands for better diagnostic treatment planning and more accurate information. Currently, this information is scattered throughout each of the different treatment and information systems in the oncology department. Furthermore, the lack of organization with standardized methods makes it difficult and time-consuming to navigate through the maze of data, resulting in challenges during patient treatment planning. We present a methodology to develop this electronic patient record (ePR) system based on DICOM standards and perform knowledge-based medical imaging informatics research on specific clinical scenarios where patients are treated with PT. Treatment planning is similar in workflow to traditional radiation therapy (RT) methods such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which utilizes a priori knowledge to drive the treatment plan in an inverse manner. In March 2006, two new RT objects were drafted in a DICOM-RT Supplement 102 specifically for ion therapy, which includes PT. The standardization of DICOM-RT-ION objects and the development of a knowledge base as well as decision-support tools that can be add-on features to the ePR DICOM-RT system were researched. This methodology can be used to extend to PT and the development of future clinical decision-making scenarios during the course of the patient's treatment that utilize "inverse treatment planning." We present the initial steps of this imaging and informatics methodology for PT and lay the foundation for development of future decision-support tools tailored to cancer patients treated with PT. By integrating decision-support knowledge and tools designed to assist in the decision-making process, a new and improved "knowledge-enhanced treatment planning" approach can be realized

Xerostomia is a serious, permanent, and ubiquitous sequelae in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This study was designed to investigate the severity of xerostomia and its impact on the quality of life in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated by conventional radiation therapy in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, were surveyed by interview at the outpatient. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analysis of xerostomia and xerostomia-related problems. RESULTS: Of 136 patents, 73.5% of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. 82.4% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate speech; 92.6% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate chewing and swallowing; 91.2% of the patients changed their feeding pattern (can eat only mashed food); 61.3% of the patients had to wake up to drink water because of dry mouth; 75.0% of the patients had teeth deteriorated. CONCLUSION: 73.5% of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. Xerostomia has a significant impact on the patient's speech, deglutition, sleep, and increases the morbidity rate of the tooth

This study was to investigate clinical value of submandibular salivary gland transfer in preventing radiation-induced xerostomia of NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 70 eligible patients with NPC were recruited, and divided into test group (36 patients) and control group (34 patients). In test group, the submandibular glands were transferred to the submental spaces before conventional radiotherapy. The submental spaces were shielded during radiotherapy. Oral cavity mucous membrane reaction during radiotherapy, submandibular gland function and salivary fluid before and after radiotherapy, and questionnaire of xerostomia 3 months after radiotherapy were compared between test group and control group. RESULTS: Acute oral cavity mucous membrane reaction was severer in control group than in test group; the incidence of stage III reaction was significantly higher in control group than in test group ( 8/34 vs. 3/36, P = 0.007). Three months after radiotherapy, trapping and excretion functions of the transferred submandibular glands were significantly better than those of the untransferred submandibular glands in test group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.000); trapping and excretion functions of the submandibular glands were significantly better in test group than in control group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.000). The mean weight of salivary fluid after radiotherapy was heavier in test group than in control group (1.41 g vs. 0.71 g). Incidence of moderate to severe degree of xerostomia was significantly higher in test group than in control group (76.5% vs. 13.9%, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Submandibular gland transfer may be used to prevent radiation-induced xerostomia of NPC patients, and may improve life quality of the patients	
0	3425	Chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by neutron irradiation	Cell Survival, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Effects, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage	In vitro dose--response curves of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes have been obtained for neutron spectra of mean energies 0-7, 0-9, 7-6 and 14-7 MeV. The aberration yields have been fitted to the quadratic function Y = alphaD + betaD2, which is consistent with the single-track and two-track model of aberration formation. However with high-LET radiation, the linear component of yield, corresponding to damage caused by single tracks, predominants, and this term becomes more dominant with increasing LET, so that for fission spectrum neutrons the relationship is linear, Y = alphaD. At low doses, such as those recieved by radiation workers, limiting r.b.e. values between 13 and 47 are obtained relative to 60Co gamma-radiation. At higher doses, as used in radiotherapy, the values are much lower; ranging from 2-7 to 8 at 200 rad of equivalent gamma-radiation. Both sets of r.b.e. values correlate well with track-averaged LET but not with dose-averaged LET. When the numbers of cells without aberrations are plotted against radiation dose, curves are obtained which are similar in shape to those for conventional cell-survival experiments with comparable neutron spectra. The Do values obtained in the present study are close to those from other cell system

Focussed accelerated helium ion beams derived from charged-particle cyclotrons are stereotactically directed into the brain to obliterate abnormal shunts. Treated patients demonstrate delayed changes in brain anatomy and function that occur months to years after radiosurgery. The underlying mechanisms of the brain's delayed reaction to charged-particle radiosurgery involve complex perturbations in cerebrovascular and metabolic function. This report describes the wide range of delayed reactions that may occur in the brain after radiosurgery, including hemodynamic changes, blood-brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema, metabolic suppression, and parenchymal necrosis.

The experimental results show that the profiles function defined as the relative dose-rate across the radiation beam is useful for this purpose, and it is sufficient to determine the profile function only at one depth and for one field size.

Temozolomide has shown antineoplastic activity against malignant gliomas and more recently was beneficial in one patient with gliomatosis cerebri. To make an objective assessment of the effect of long-term temozolomide administration in a patient with gliomatosis cerebri we used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural MRI. A 46-year-old man with gliomatosis cerebri was treated with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 28 days). Twenty cycles of temozolomide resulted in a marked reduction in choline and scyllo-inositol content, as detected using brain proton MR spectroscopy, indicating reduced tumor cellularity and/or growth rate. Neurochemical improvements were associated with normalization of the signal intensity in most of the previously affected cerebral regions and regression of mass effect on MRI. A left pyramidal syndrome, present at the start of the treatment, disappeared. Our observation lends support to larger clinical trials evaluating the use of temozolomide to treat this brain tumor

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy

Twenty one patients were treated for cerebrovascular abnormalities and 23 patients were treated for intracranial tumors. Fifteen of the 23 patients treated for intracranial tumors had received previous radiotherapy. The range of doses given by radiosurgery was 1000-2500 cGy. Nausea and vomiting occurred in seven patients within six hours of treatment. The incidence and symptoms were correlated with the dose of radiation to the vomiting center (area postrema) with the median dose to the postrema in symptomatic patients being 618 cGy compared to a range of less than 5 to 184 cGy in the remaining 36 asymptomatic patients. Temporary alopecia occurred in a single patient who received 400 cGy to the scalp. Alopecia did not occur in the remaining 43 patients who received from less than 5 to 175 cGy. Two patients treated for arteriovenous malformations developed an enhancing lesion on CT scanning (one with cerebral edema) on follow-up CT scanning six and twenty-eight months following radiosurgery. The location of these enhancing lesions corresponded to the volumes treated. In one patient, the enhancing pattern and edema disappeared within 18 months of treatment and no neurological deficits developed. Aphasia occurred in one patient treated for a recurrent glioma two hours following treatment to the left temporal lobe and cleared within 12 h of radiosurgery. One patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the pons developed weakness of the contralateral arm and leg six weeks following treatment and this has slowly resolved over the last 12 months. In conclusion, the complications to date have been self-limited and appear to be directly related to the dose and area of brain treated. Prior radiation therapy has not been associated with increased risk of complication in patients treated with radiosurgery for recurrent tumors to date	
0	3435	Role of stereotactic radiosurgery with a linear accelerator in treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children	Adolescent, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebral Angiography, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Massachusetts, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Between 1986 and 1988, 16 children were treated for 10 arteriovenous malformations and 6 recurrent intracranial tumors with stereotactic radiation therapy using a modified Clinac 6/100 linear accelerator. The median age of our patients was 10.5 years. For the group with arteriovenous malformation, follow-up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (median was 20 months). No patient bled during the follow-up period. Five of eight patients with follow-up longer than 12 months have achieved complete obliteration of their arteriovenous malformation by angiogram. The four remaining patients who have not achieved a complete obliteration are awaiting their 2-year posttreatment angiogram. The other patient has been treated within the year and have not yet been studied. Five of the six recurrent tumor patients are alive with a median follow-up of 8 months. The remaining patient was controlled locally, but he died of recurrent disease outside the area treated with radiosurgery. The radiographic responses of these patients have included three complete responses, two substantial reductions in tumor volume (greater than 50%) and one stabilization. Despite previous radiotherapy, there have been no significant complications in these patients. We conclude that stereotactic radiation therapy using a standard linear accelerator is an effective and safe technique in the treatment of selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children. In addition, stereotactic radiosurgery may have unique applications in the treatment of localized primary and recurrent pediatric brain tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system for the exchange of radiotherapy data between different commercial planning systems and a specially developed planning system for proton therapy has been developed through the use of the PAPYRUS diagnostic image standard as an intermediate format. To ensure the cooperation of the different TPS manufacturers, the number of data sets defined for transfer has been restricted to the three core data sets of CT, VOIs, and three-dimensional dose distributions. As a complement to the exchange of data, network-wide application-sharing (video-conferencing) technologies have been adopted to provide methods for the interactive discussion and assessment of treatments plans with one or more partner clinics. RESULTS: Through the use of evaluation plans based on the exchanged data, referring clinics can accurately assess the advantages offered by proton therapy on a patient-by-patient basis, while the practicality or otherwise of the proposed treatments can simultaneously be assessed by the proton therapy center. Such a system, along with the interactive capabilities provided by video-conferencing methods, has been found to be an efficient solution to the problem of patient assessment and selection at a specialized treatment center, and is a necessary first step toward the full electronic integration of such centers with their remotely situated referral centers

Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, base-of-skull sarcomas, low-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and para-nasal sinus tumors. In addition, we have treated bone sarcomas in the neck and trunk--mainly in the sacral area--as well as prostate cases and some soft tissue sarcomas. PTV volumes for our treated cases are in the range 20-4500 ml, indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating lesions of all types and sizes. The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of fluence modulated Bragg peaks delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 000. With the current delivery rate of roughly 3000 Bragg peaks per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to 20-25 min. Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about 10% of delivered spots have a weight of more than 10% of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for optimizing the number of spots delivered per field. Field specific dosimetry shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within +/-1 mm (1 SD) orthogonal to the field direction and to within 1.5 mm in range. With our current delivery system the mean widths of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 mm (sigma) for all energies, indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be made. In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg peaks shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg peaks over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of penetration. This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast re-scanning on second generation scanning gantries

Most published studies on radiation toxicity have been performed retrospectively. Our prospective study was launched in 1996 to measure the in vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes before treatment with radical radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer, and to assess the early and the late radiation skin side effects in the same group of patients. We prospectively recruited consecutive breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy after breast surgery. To evaluate whether early and late side effects of radiotherapy can be predicted by the assay, a study was conducted of the association between the results of in vitro radiosensitivity tests and acute and late adverse radiation effects. METHODS: Intrinsic molecular radiosensitivity was measured by using an initial radiation-induced DNA damage assay on lymphocytes obtained from breast cancer patients before radiotherapy. Acute reactions were assessed in 108 of these patients on the last treatment day. Late morbidity was assessed after 7 years of follow-up in some of these patients. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) morbidity score system was used for both assessments. RESULTS: Radiosensitivity values obtained using the in vitro test showed no relation with the acute or late adverse skin reactions observed. There was no evidence of a relation between acute and late normal tissue reactions assessed in the same patients. A positive relation was found between the treatment volume and both early and late side effects. CONCLUSION: After radiation treatment, a number of cells containing major changes can have a long survival and disappear very slowly, becoming a chronic focus of immunological system stimulation. This stimulation can produce, in a stochastic manner, late radiation-related adverse effects of varying severity. Further research is warranted to identify the major determinants of normal tissue radiation response to make it possible to individualize treatments and improve the outcome of radiotherapy in cancer patients

1	60	[Point of view of the neurosurgeon]. [French]	Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods]	Stereotactic radiosurgery, a term introduced by Leksell, was born more than 40 years ago, but has made great strides for the last 15 years. There is no consensus among neurosurgeons as to the best device (gamma knife, linear accelerator), the treatment doses, and the clinical indications of stereotactic radiosurgery. Therefore, this report is the viewpoint of one neurosurgical team only. In the radiosurgery literature, there is no clear evidence of better results with the gamma-knife or the linear accelerators. With regard to clinical applications, cerebral arteriovenous malformations are the more widely accepted indications of radiosurgery, since a cerebral angiography can confirm the disappearance of the nidus of an arteriovenous malformation treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Usually, small and deep arteriovenous malformations can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery only. Nevertheless, the treatment of the other arteriovenous malformations more often require procedures including one or several of the following treatment methods: microneurosurgery, interventional neuradiology, stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery in acoustic schwannomas, skull base meningiomas, especially those involving the cavernous sinus, brain metastases, and pituitary tumors seem attractive. Contrary to arteriovenous malformations, the lack of criteria for cure requires a long follow-up and carefully controlled trials to confirm the efficiency of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors. On the other hand, experience of stereotactic radiosurgery for astrocytomas and glioblastomas is limited, and few publications are available. Furthermore, because of the infiltrating growth, a major impact of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors is presumably not to be expected. Lastly, a close multidisciplinary approach seems absolutely necessary to define the best indications of stereotactic radiosurgery and to improve its clinical results

Twelve patients received silicone tubes and were compared to a control group of 12 patients with irradiated nasal tumors without silicone tubes. Symptoms of nasolacrimal duct obstruction and epiphora were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. All patients had nasolacrimal duct irrigation. Patients intubated before irradiation maintained patency (11 of 12), whereas those in the control group did not (zero of 12) (P less than .0014); ten of 12 control patients had closure of both superior and inferior puncta. No significant difference in symptoms of epiphora was observed between the two groups

1	2006	Evaluation of polymer gels and MRI as a 3-D dosimeter for intensity-modulated radiation therapy	Biophysics, Calibration, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Film Dosimetry, Gels, Germany, Glass, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Polymers, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Time	BANG gel (MGS Research, Inc., Guilford, CT) has been evaluated for measuring intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose distributions. Treatment plans with target doses of 1500 cGy were generated by the Peacock IMRT system (NOMOS Corp., Sewickley, PA) using test target volumes. The gels were enclosed in 13 cm outer diameter cylindrical glass vessels. Dose calibration was conducted using seven smaller (4 cm diameter) cylindrical glass vessels irradiated to 0-1800 cGy in 300 cGy increments. Three-dimensional maps of the proton relaxation rate R2 were obtained using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) and correlated with dose. A Hahn spin echo sequence was used with TR = 3 s, TE = 20 and 100 ms, NEX = 1, using 1 x 1 x 3 mm3 voxels. The MRI measurements were repeated weekly to identify the gel-aging characteristics. Ionization chamber, thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD), and film dosimetry measurements of the IMRT dose distributions were obtained to compare against the gel results. The other dosimeters were used in a phantom with the same external cross-section as the gel phantom. The irradiated R2 values of the large vessels did not precisely track the smaller vessels, so the ionization chamber measurements were used to normalize the gel dose distributions. The point-to-point standard deviation of the gel dose measurements was 7.0 cGy. When compared with the ionization chamber measurements averaged over the chamber volume, 1% agreement was obtained. Comparisons against radiographic film dose distribution measurements and the treatment planning dose distribution calculation were used to determine the spatial localization accuracy of the gel and MRI. Spatial localization was better than 2 mm, and the dose was accurately determined by the gel both within and outside the target. The TLD chips were placed throughout the phantom to determine gel measurement precision in high- and low-dose regions. A multidimensional dose comparison tool that simultaneously examines the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement was used to evaluate the gel in both low-and high-dose gradient regions. When 3% and 3 mm criteria were used for the comparisons, more than 90% of the TLD measurements agreed with the gel, with the worst of 309 TLD chip measurements disagreeing by 40% of the criteria. All four MRI measurement session gel-measured dose distributions were compared to evaluate the time behavior of the gel. The low-dose regions were evaluated by comparison with TLD measurements at selected points, while high-dose regions were evaluated by directly comparing measured dose distributions. Tests using the multidimensional comparison tool showed detectable degradation beyond one week postirradiation, but all low-dose measurements passed relative to the test criteria and the dose distributions showed few regions that failed

This study presents a technique that overcomes these difficulties, reduces scatter to the contralateral breast, and improves setup reproducibility. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients are set up with both arms raised superiorly on a breast board. A precise field-match is achieved by rotating the couch and collimator of the tangents, while the supraclavicular field is half-beam blocked using an independent jaw. The posterior borders of the tangents are conformally defined by multileaf collimation. Measurements were performed to verify the field matching and evaluate scatter doses. RESULT: A smooth dose transition was found at the match line at all depths. Corner blocks and lower wedges were not used, which reduced the scatter to the contralateral breast compared with our prior technique. CONCLUSION: The technique achieves a precise match while removing constraints on the tangents' length and decreasing scatter dose. Procedures for simulation, planning, and treatment have been devised, along with a new patient setup routine incorporating orthogonal setup films and tattoos. This technique has been successfully implemented in routine treatment since September 2001. A program calculating the setup parameters is available at our website

This study analyzes relapse and survival in a community-based population with L-SCLC according to age and comorbidity. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 174 patients with L-SCLC referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre, between January 1991 and December 1999. Patient and treatment characteristics, disease response, relapse, and survival were compared among three age cohorts: <65 years (n = 55, 32%), 65-74 years (n = 76, 44%), and > or =75 years (n = 43, 25%); and according to Charlson comorbidity scores 0, 1, and > or =2. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with treatment response and survival. RESULTS: Patient factors that significantly differed with age were functional status classified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and number of comorbidities. Increasing age was significantly associated with fewer diagnostic scans. Combined modality chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was given in 86%, 66%, and 40% of patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively, (p <0.0001). Thoracic irradiation use was comparable among the age cohorts (p >0.05), but chemotherapy use varied significantly with less intensive regimens, fewer cycles, and lower total doses with advancing age (p <0.05). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was used in 41 patients, only 3 of whom were age >70 years. Overall response rates to primary treatment significantly decreased with advancing age: 91%, 79%, and 74% in patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively (p = 0.014). Treatment toxicity and relapse patterns were similar across the age cohorts. Overall 2-year survival rates were significantly lower with advancing age: 37%, 22%, and 19% (p = 0.003), with corresponding median survivals of 17, 12, and 7 months among patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age and Charlson comorbidity scores were not significantly associated with treatment response and survival. Independent prognostic factors favorably associated with survival were good performance status, normal lactate dehydrogenase, absence of pleural effusion, and > or =four cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity. Older patients with L-SCLC were less likely to be treated with CRT, intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Treatment response and survival rates were lower with advancing age, but this may be attributed to poor performance status and suboptimal treatment rather than age. [References: 31]

Longterm follow-up after conventional high voltage radiation in 17 patients and proton therapy in 13 patients confirmed a similar reduction of GH levels in both groups. After 4.5 years a decrease of about 80% was achieved. After "conventional radiation" GH was normal in 8 (47%) and near normal in 6 (35%) while proton therapy resulted in normalization in 5 and improvement in 5 (38%). The slightly better results of "conventional radiation" must be attributed to lower pretreatment levels of GH. Side effects as additional pituitary deficits and oculomotor palsies were more often seen after proton treatment. Since the results of both radiation methods are similar and proton therapy has a tendency to more serious side effects we recommend "conventional radiation" as secondary treatment of acromegaly

METHODS: Retrospective review of the charts of patients with iris melanoma treated by proton beam therapy between April 1998 and September 2002. Ciliary body melanomas with iris involvement or tumours with extrascleral invasion were excluded. Treatment consisted of 60 Gy of proton beam irradiation delivered in four fractions to the tumour volume. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated, median follow-up of 33 months (8-72 months). 15 patients presented a lesion with documented growth. The median clinical diameter was 5 mm (2-8 mm), the median ultrasound diameter 4.8 mm (2-7.7 mm) The patients were 6% T1, 57.1% T2, and 14.3% T3 all N0M0. The iridocorneal angle was invaded by the tumour in 71.4% of patients. At the end of follow-up, all patients were alive with no proven metastatic disease except one patient with suspicious liver lesions. None of the patients showed tumour progression or ocular relapse. The tumour response at 2 years was a flat lesion for 6.3% of cases, partial regression in 75% and stable in 18.8%. None of the patients required secondary enucleation. The main complication was cataract (45% within 24 months of treatment). Raised intraocular pressure was observed in 15% of patients but no neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy shows potential utility for selected cases of localised iris melanomas allowing excellent local tumour control and eye preservation. Further follow-up on larger series is needed to confirm these results

METHODS: Data from a cohort of patients with uveal melanoma treated by proton beam irradiation between 1991 and 1994 were analysed. The presence of inflammation was recorded and evaluated. Kaplan-Meier estimates and statistical analysis of general and tumour related risk factors were performed. RESULTS: 28% of patients treated during this period presented with ocular inflammation (median follow up 62 months). Risks factors were essentially tumour related and were correlated with larger lesions (height > 5 mm, diameter > 12 mm, volume > 0.4 cm(3)). Multivariate analysis identified initial tumour height and irradiation of a large volume of the eye as the two most important risk factors. Ocular inflammation usually consisted of mild anterior uveitis, resolving rapidly after topical steroids and cycloplegics. The incidence of inflammation after proton beam irradiation of melanomas seems higher than previously reported and is related to larger lesions. Evidence of inflammation associated with uveal melanoma has been described and seems to be associated with tumour necrosis (spontaneous or after irradiation). The appearance of transient inflammation during the follow up of these patients may be related to the release of inflammatory cytokines during tumour necrosis. CONCLUSION: Inflammation following proton beam irradiation is not unusual. It is correlated with larger initial tumours and may be related to tumour necrosis

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a series of patients treated with proton beam irradiation between 1991 and December 1998. The data were analyzed to evaluate the local tumor control as well as the general progression and metastatic rate of the patients. Statistical analysis served to isolate risk factors for relapse or metastasis. RESULTS: We treated 1062 patients during the study period, with a median follow-up of 38 months. Local control was obtained for 97.1% of the patients. Tumors anterior to the equator were at risk for relapse. The survival rate was 92% at 2 years and 78% at 5 years. 73.1% of the 1062 patients died from metastasis, 6.1% of living patients presented with metastatic disease. The risk factors for death were the initial diameter, the age of the patient, and large tumor volume at diagnosis. Metastasis were essentially hepatic (94.6%). Risk factors for metastasis were: a large tumor volume, a lesion anterior or straddling the equator and the age of the patient. Ocular complications may induce a visual loss of 0.1 and less in 47% of the patients, due to optic nerve head and macular ischemia. 6% of the patients required secondary enucleation due to local complications (neovascular glaucoma). CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal melanoma allows good tumor control and eye retention. The survival prognosis is associated with the initial volume of the tumor. The functional results may be improved and new therapeutics are needed to treat metastatic disease

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

Proton radiation therapy has potential to reduce the risk of adverse events compared with conventional radiation, but it is associated with a higher treatment cost. The objective of the current study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of proton therapy compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma. METHODS: The consequences of radiation therapy were evaluated using a Markov simulation model. Children age 5 years with medulloblastoma were followed. The patients were at risk of several types of adverse events, including hearing loss, intelligence quotient (IQ) loss, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), osteoporosis, cardiac disease, and secondary malignancies. The patients also were at risk of death and were divided into risk groups for normal death, death due to tumor recurrence, treatment-related cardiac death, treatment-related subsequent tumor death, or treatment-related other death. A review of the literature was conducted to estimate the parameters in the model. RESULTS: The base-case results showed that proton therapy was associated with 23,600 in cost savings and 0.68 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The analyses showed that reductions in IQ loss and GHD contributed to the greatest part of the cost savings and were the most important parameters for cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated that proton radiation therapy can be cost-effective and cost-saving compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of children with medulloblastoma if the appropriate patients are selected for the therapy. However, there have been few long-term follow-up studies, and more much information on the long-term consequences of radiation therapy is needed. Copyright (c) 2005 American Cancer Society

Thirty-two cases of chronic radiation ulcer have been treated in the department since 1983. The cause, site, features and method of treatment were summarized. Thirty-one cases were cured, 26 cases healed by the first intention, 5 cases healed by the second intention. One died. It is emphasized that more knowledge should be gained for understanding and treatment of the chronic radiation ulcer. Different methods of debridement and repair should be performed according to the site, depth and pathologic features of the ulcer. To improve local circulation, an island flap is the first choice of treatment	
0	3461	In vivo diode dosimetry for total marrow irradiation	Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Calibration, Humans, Immobilization, Methods, Multiple Myeloma/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reading, Silicon, Skin, Time, Transplantation Conditioning, Umbilicus	PURPOSE: To describe a method and evaluate the efficacy of using a p-type silicon diode as an alternative to thermoluminescent dosimeters for verifying the accuracy of total marrow irradiation setups and calculations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A calibration factor has been measured for a 6 MV photon beam incident horizontally onto a polystyrene phantom inside an in-house built total marrow irradiation stand. Signal responses due to positioning and orientation of the diode with respect to the source were compared to a 0.6 cc cylindrical ionization chamber inside a polystyrene phantom. Procedures for predicting the diode reading and taking entrance measurements have been developed and action levels established to determine causes for discrepancies when ratios between predicted and actual values fell outside a +/- 5% tolerance range. Measurements were taken at the skin surface over the umbilicus calculation point for alternating 1.5 Gy anterior and posterior fractions given bidaily over a 3-day period. RESULTS: A total of 137 measurements taken from January to September 1994 for 23 patients were analyzed using a frequency histogram. The histogram indicated a mean reading of 1.002 +/- 2.6, and that three of the measurements fell outside the 5% tolerance. Investigation into the cause of the discrepancies showed that the diode had been improperly placed one time and that further patient immobilization needs to be considered. CONCLUSION: It is possible to use a diode as an in vivo dosimeter for a total marrow irradiation technique. The ease of implementation and immediate readouts make a diode system preferable to a thermoluminescent system for identifying systematic errors and verifying treatment configurations and monitor unit calculations

Our method uses a modified Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRS), CT-guided, stereotactic system and a 6 MV linear accelerator equipped with a special collimator (diameters of 12.5 mm to 30.0 mm projected to isocenter) located 23 cm from isocenter. Target localization via planar angiography has been added. Treatment consists of a series of arcing beams using both gantry and couch rotations. During treatment, the patient's head is immobilized independently of the radiotherapy couch and is precisely positioned without reference to room lasers or light field. A precise verification of alignment precedes each treatment. Extensive performance tests have shown that a target, localized by CT, can be irradiated with a positional accuracy of 2.4 mm in any direction with 95% confidence. If angiography is used for localization, the results are better. The dose 1.0 cm outside the target volume is less than 20% of the prescribed dose for a medium sized collimator

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

[Review] [14 refs]	Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced/mt [Methods], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Phantoms,Imaging, Sensitivity and Specificity	There is growing clinical evidence that the combination of radiation therapy and hyperthermia, when delivered at moderate temperatures (40 degrees-45 degrees C) for sustained times (30-90 minutes), is of benefit with regard to palliative relief of cancer, tumor response, local control, and survival. Adequate measurement of the temperature distribution achieved with the hyperthermia is a key element in successful therapy. Thermal dosimetry, even invasive dosimetry, is a complex topic when applied to the heterogeneous tissue of a tumor and associated organ systems. Imaging in hyperthermia therapy is performed primarily for estimation and control of temperature. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has unique parameter dependences that make it possible to monitor hyperthermia therapy by detection of proton resonant frequency changes or diffusion coefficient changes. In addition, MR imaging can be used to assess vascular parameters that not only allow selection of suitable patients for therapy but may also allow demonstration of response to therapy. Finally, as the use of thermally sensitive liposomes for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents is developed, MR imaging may allow determination of local drug dose. RSNA, 2007 [References: 14]

The localisation and locally-destructive growth require a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic concept early on. The goal of the present study was to present a reproducible strategy for quality assurance. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the hospital records of 10 consecutive patients (4 women and 6 men) whom we had treated during a period of 7 years. RESULTS: The first step in therapy was tumour resection in 9 cases. One patient initially underwent stereotactic radiation. Postoperative radiation was not included a priori, but discussed individually depending on the degree of resection, the patient's age and physical condition. After an average 5 years follow up, 100 % of patients are alive. In all patients, tumour control was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with chordomas of the skull base has improved considerably in recent years. New technologies like intraoperative navigation and improved radiation procedures have contributed to this improvement. The basis for treatment remains, however, the greatest possible surgical exstirpation with minimal surgical morbidity. Special attention should be paid in this connection to the stability of the cervical spine and the craniocervical transition border. In advanced tumour growth, complete resection is often not possible. Proton and heavy-ion radiation are promising new forms of therapy, which can also be applied after conventional radiation has been performed. A directed multidisciplinary procedure guarantees years of survival with good quality of life in many cases

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was performed between the Hungarian radiotherapy centers in order to compare the dose prescription methods. Then, treatment plans of 125 breast cancer patients treated in our department were evaluated. The irradiations were performed with cobalt unit, and with 6 and 9 MV photon beams of linear accelerators. The dose distributions were normalized to izocenter, then dose values in five points in central plane; local medial, lateral and central maximums (D(med), D(lat) and D(cent)); volumetric maximum and its location were determined. To characterize the dose to lung and to heart at left-sided tumors the central lung distance (CLD) and maximum heart distance (MHD) were used. Based on the results, estimation was made to assess the differences between delivered dose due to various dose prescriptions applied at the institutions. RESULTS: Four types of dose prescription are currently used in our country, and most frequently the isocenter is selected as a reference point. In the central plane the calculated dose in all but one points differed only a little from the dose to isocenter. The mean D(med), D(lat) and D(cent) were 107%, 107% and 101%, respectively. The volumetric maximum was on average 13% higher than the dose to isocenter. Regarding the beam qualities, this value was 16%, 13% and 11% for cobalt unit, 6 MV and 9 MV photon beams, respectively. The mean CLD and MHD were 1.9 and 0.8 cm, respectively. The difference between delivered doses at the institutions was 6% on average, but in extreme cases it can be as high as 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional treatment planning and plan evaluation are recommended at breast irradiation, especially for large breasts. Since the various dose prescriptions may result in significant differences in the delivered doses, use of a standard dose prescription protocol is recommended

[German]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Brain/bs [Blood Supply], Child, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy, Risk, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time	Arterio-venous malformations of the brain are accompanied by a risk of hemorrhages which increases in the course of time. Thus a therapy is indicated as soon as the arterio-venous malformation is discovered. If surgical treatment is contra-indicated, radiotherapy can be applied with a high rate of success (obliteration of the arterio-venous malformation after two years in up to 88% of cases). Percutaneous radiotherapy has to be performed with a stereotaxic technique under controlled conditions. The stipulations for this treatment are described on the basis of our own method. Between August 1982 and July 1983, twenty patients have been treated without any complications due to therapy or to the disease. This form of radiotherapy using the bremsstrahlung of a linear accelerator can be considered as an alternative method with respect to proton irradiation

Complications, due to therapy, did not occur. Suffering from convulsion was not affected. Five patients have died, one patient got a hemorrhage 36 months later. The angiographical analysis of the first 25 patients until 30 months after radiotherapy gave complete obliterations and reduction of volume in more than 50% with minor AVM's.

Chondroid mineralisation, a histological feature of chondrosarcoma, can be recognised on CT and is, together with the off-midline position of the tumour, the most characteristic finding. Differentiation is usually made by histological and immunocytochemical staining. Surgery, proton radiation therapy and stereotactic single high-dose irradiation have been used to treat patients with chondrosarcoma. It is worth mentioning that it was likely that the chondrosarcoma in our patient represented a malignant degeneration of an enchondroma that had been resected 30 years earlier	
0	1602	Cobalt 60 versus 15 MeV photons during total body irradiation: doses in the critical organs and complexicity of the procedure	Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Humans, Immunosuppression/mt [Methods], Lung, Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Photons, Poland, Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Thorax, Time, Whole-Body Irradiation/mt [Methods]	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to compare the doses in critical organs, treatment duration, patient comfort and personnel workload during total body irradiation carried out alternatively with a Cobalt 60 and with 15 MeV photons at linear accelerator. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients irradiated with a Cobalt unit and twenty irradiated with 15 MeV photons in a linear accelerator were used for comparison of the dose delivered. Each irradiation was repeated eight times during four consecutive days up to a total dose of 12.6 Gy in the whole body (below 10 Gy in the lungs). Lateral fields were used in six fractions, and anterior-posterior fields in two fractions. An electron boost to the thorax wall was added. Doses were calculated and measured in-vivo in ten transverse sections. RESULTS: For the patient taken as an example doses in the middle of the lungs were 10.7 Gy for Co-60 and 11.2 Gy for 15 MeV photons without compensators and 9.6 Gy, 9.6 Gy respectively when compensators were applied. Mean doses in the lungs in the group were 9.5 Gy for Co-60 and 9.7 Gy for X 15 MeV, respectively. Duration of the treatment was shorter with the use of the 15 MeV than that with Co-60 by about 20%. Repositioning of the patient during two fractions with the use of X 15 MeV could be eliminated and therefore the patient's comfort increased

Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University, for a ten-year period from 1976-1986. The overall incidence was 1.3% of all gynecologic malignancies. Twenty-four patients (83%) had squamous cell carcinoma and five (17%) had adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly located in the upper anterior and lateral vaginal vaults, whereas adenocarcinoma was found more often in the lower anterior and lateral vaginal vaults. The majority of the patients (96%) were managed by a combination of whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients had a recurrence in the vagina only, indicating the need for better local control. The overall survival rate was 48%. Patients with previous hysterectomy were more likely to develop serious treatment-related complications

For patients with unilateral lymphadenopathy, lateral oblique-opposed boost fields can be used to encompass the primary tumor and ipsilateral lymph nodes without junctioning through gross disease. When initial collimated lateral fields are also rotated with a gantry angle to produce oblique boost fields, however, the resulting matchline with a low anterior neck (LAN) boost field is no longer nondivergent. This can be corrected by manual adjustment of collimator and gantry angles for the LAN field using 3D treatment planning software. The goal of this study was to derive mathematical formulas to simplify this process. We used a transformation matrix to define formulas that could predict the appropriate modifications to the LAN boost field. Output from the formulas was (1) visually tested within 3D treatment planning software and (2) verified using a solid water head-and-neck phantom and radiographic film dosimetry to confirm that a nondivergent matchline was obtained in several clinical scenarios. When evaluated with 3D treatment planning software, the formulas accurately predicted the appropriate gantry and collimator angles of the LAN boost field for a variety of possible beam combinations. When evaluated with film dosimetry, the formulas were shown to accurately predict the appropriate gantry and collimator angles of the LAN boost field to within the +/- 2 mm/1 degrees tolerance specifications of the linear accelerator and acceptable for routine clinical use. The presented formulas are simple and geometrically precise. They predict the necessary manipulations of the LAN boost field to maintain a geometrically precise matchline, as verified by 3D treatment planning software, phantom dosimetry, and actual patient setups	
0	1110	The efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of intracranial ependymoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Disease-Free Survival, Ependymoma/mo [Mortality], Ependymoma/pp [Physiopathology], Ependymoma/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Salvage Therapy, Survival	OBJECTIVE: A retrospective analysis was performed to determine the outcome of patients with intracranial ependymoma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: Nine ependymoma patients have been treated with SRS (four with linear accelerator and five with Gamma Knife) since 1990. Two patients had WHO grade III tumors, and the remaining seven had WHO grade II tumors. Eight of nine patients received external beam radiation therapy at some point prior to radiosurgery to a total median dose of 54 Gy. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 14 to 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 35 years. Four patients developed progressive disease following radiosurgery, and two patients have died of progressive disease. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 55.6%. The 3-year overall survival was 71.1%. Patients treated with radiosurgery as a component of initial treatment (generally as a boost following external beam) had an improved relapse-free survival (100%) compared to those treated with radiosurgery to salvage an external beam local failure (20%). CONCLUSION: SRS is an effective treatment for intracranial ependymoma. Further clinical trials are warranted incorporating radiosurgery as a component of initial management in selected ependymoma patients

With this aim, they sought to determine the nature, thickness and position of the decelerating which should be used to obtain adequate flow and energy of the electron bundle. They then explain the technique of total body irradiation of the patients, and in particular the way in which the functions of the bundle are effected. Finally, in order to diminish under-dosage in regions of the human body irradiated tangentially, they suggest the use of a perspex screen of variable thickness

1	208	The impact of advanced technologies on treatment deviations in radiation treatment delivery	Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Prospective Studies, Quality Assurance,Health Care/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Technology,Radiologic/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic/st [Standards]	PURPOSE: To assess the impact of new technologies on deviation rates in radiation therapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment delivery deviations in RT were prospectively monitored during a time of technology upgrade. In January 2003, our department had three accelerators, none with "modern" technologies (e.g., without multileaf collimators [MLC]). In 2003 to 2004, we upgraded to five new accelerators, four with MLC, and associated advanced capabilities. The deviation rates among patients treated on "high-technology" versus "low-technology" machines (defined as those with vs. without MLC) were compared over time using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In 2003, there was no significant difference between the deviation rate in the "high-technology" versus "low-technology" groups (0.16% vs. 0.11%, p = 0.45). In 2005 to 2006, the deviation rate for the "high-technology" groups was lower than the "low-technology" (0.083% vs. 0.21%, p = 0.009). This difference was caused by a decline in deviations on the "high-technology" machines over time (p = 0.053), as well as an unexpected trend toward an increase in deviations over time on the "low-technology" machines (p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Advances in RT delivery systems appear to reduce the rate of treatment deviations. Deviation rates on "high-technology" machines with MLC decline over time, suggesting a learning curve after the introduction of new technologies. Associated with the adoption of "high-technology" was an unexpected increase in the deviation rate with "low-technology" approaches, which may reflect an over-reliance on tools inherent to "high-technology" machines. With the introduction of new technologies, continued diligence is needed to ensure that staff remain proficient with "low-technology" approaches

New symptoms and corresponding radiologic abnormalities developed 4-28 months after therapy. Five patients had similar patterns of white matter changes and mass effect on computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images. The abnormalities were centered in the radiation field. Gray matter changes and abnormal enhancement in the thalamus and hypothalamus outside the radiation field developed in one patient. This patient also had vasculopathic changes on angiograms. Rapidly progressive large vessel vasculopathy developed in another patient and caused occlusion of major vessels. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in the complications of heavy-ion radiosurgery

Twenty patients had high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). After treatment 18 of 20 AVMs (90%) showed a significant reduction in size on angiograms or MR images. Eleven of 20 (55%) had complete resolution on angiograms or MR images, 35% had partial resolution, and 10% showed no size change. Before treatment, the size range of the AVMs was 0.86-383 cm3 (median, 21.7 cm3). Smaller AVMs (less than 8 cm3) were more likely to resolve completely than medium-sized AVMs (8-64 cm3) or larger AVMs (greater than 64 cm3). Four additional patients had slow-flow vascular malformations: One had a venous angioma; one, a probable cavernous hemangioma; and two, malformations that were not seen on angiograms. CT proved inaccurate in demonstrating the boundaries of the AVM after treatment because it showed persistent contrast enhancement even when the AVM was completely obliterated on angiograms. MR imaging and angiography were complementary in the evaluation of therapeutic results and should be the primary modalities in the examination of patients with AVMs

Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

In the literature 220 cases of sweat gland carcinomas have been presented over the last three decades. The medium age is 57 years, with an equal male-to-female distribution. Topographically, the tumor is located at the lower limbs (32.9%), the upper extremities (28%), and the head (26%). Involvement of the trunk is rare. Diagnosis can be complicated as the carcinoma is a rare entity, with no correlation of its histologic classification and biologic presentation. This can only implicate the difficulties in treatment

[Russian]	Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Aged, Cushing Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Pituitary Irradiation, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The application of protons (heavy charged particles) for irradiation of the pituitary body has some essential advantages over other types of teletherapy: insignificant destruction of surrounding tissues, a possibility of a single therapeutic session as well as the absence of post-radiation effects. Proton beam therapy was given to 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease aged 15 to 40. Mild cases were treated by proton beam irradiation only while severe cases were managed using proton beam therapy combined with unilateral adrenalectomy or oral administration of ortho-para-DDD. Catamnesis duration varied from 3 to 5 years. In most cases the exposure dose was 80-90 Gy (50-110 Gy). The procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. A dynamic multipolar converting method with 15-20 entrance poles in the left temporal area was employed (with the beam energy of 200 MeV). Stabilization of the course of disease and some clinical improvement were observed in most of the patients 3-4 months after proton beam therapy. In 6-36 months after irradiation 90% of the patients showed normal biochemical indices and the absence of any clinical signs of the disease. Three-five years after treatment, 94% of the patients were in steady remission. A 24-hour ACTH and cortisol normalization pattern was observed in all the patients in parallel with an increase in GH and gonadotropin secretion and a decrease in the prolactin level. Sex function renewal appeared to be the first clinical sign of remission. Young patients aged 15 to 20 with a short duration of disease reached remission faster than patients of the other age groups. Thus the results of proton beam therapy of 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease after a follow-up of 3-5 years showed a high efficacy of this type of treatment. The method can be used alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy as well as with oral administration of ortho-para-DDD

The latter was mainly a result of partial irradiation of pituitary adenoma. Some patients after proton irradiation demonstrated signs of adenohypophyseal functional insufficiency, more marked in patients with a decreased level of Gy (over 5 ng/ml). A conclusion is that proton beam therapy is effective (provided all criteria for patients' eligibility are observed) and can be used as an independent method for the treatment of acromegalic patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and August 1998 we treated 35 patients with stage cT1-3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. Thirty-two patients with a follow-up of 12 to 28 months (median: 18 months) were evaluated. After ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of 4 non-parallel needles, CT based 3D brachytherapy treatment planning ("Offenbach system") was performed. All patients received 4 fractions brachytherapy using a fractional dose of 5 or 7 Gy. Time between each fraction was 14 days. After brachytherapy 3D external irradiation followed up to 39.6 or 45.0 Gy. All patients received androgen deprivation, starting 2 to 19 months before brachytherapy, ending 3 months after 3D external radiotherapy. RESULTS: Posttreatment PSA levels dropped to < 1.5 ng/ml in 29/32 patients (91%). In 25 patients PSA levels were < 0.5 ng/ml, in 4 patients 0.5 to 1.5 ng/ml. In 2 patients we noted biochemical relapse. Transrectal implantation was very well tolerated. Grade 3 acute urinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient. We noted no Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient developed a Grade 3 late urinary toxicity. No patient showed late gastrointestinal side effects. All 140 dose-volume histograms for 3D HDR brachytherapy were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The new 3D HDR brachytherapy technique, combined with 3D external irradiation and androgen deprivation, is a feasible, so far well-tolerated and effective treatment in the short-time follow-up of median 18 months

Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators

METHODS AND MATERIAL: The 3D dose distributions were analyzed in 85 patients with cervical vertebral tumors. Mean follow-up was 41.3 months. The mean prescribed dose was 76.3 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE = proton dose x RBE 1.1). Dose constraints to the center and the surface of the cervical cord were 55-58 CGE and 67-70 CGE, respectively. Dose parameters, DVH and EUD, were calculated for each patient. The spinal cord toxicity was graded using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late effects scoring system. RESULTS: Thirteen patients experienced Grade 1-2 toxicity. Four patients had Grade 3 toxicity. For the dose range used in this study, none of the dosimetric parameters was found to be associated with the observed distribution of cord toxicities. The only factor significantly associated with cord toxicity was the number of surgeries before irradiation. CONCLUSION: The data and our analysis suggest that the integrity of the normal musculoskeletal supportive tissues and vascular supply may be important confounding factors of toxicity at these dose levels. The results also indicate that the cervical spinal cord dose constraints used in treating these patients are appropriate for conformal proton-photon radiotherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients received a second course of PBRT. The mean interval between the first and the second PBRT course was 50.2 months (range, 8-165 months). Most patients (87%) received 70 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for both courses. Visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 30 patients initially and in 22 patients at the second treatment. The mean follow-up time after the second treatment was 50 months (range, 6-164 months). RESULTS: At the time of the last follow-up, 20 patients were classified as having no evidence of disease, defined as tumor regression or an absence of tumor progression. Nine eyes (29%) were enucleated because of local recurrence (n = 5) or intractable pain (n = 4). The 5-year eye retention rate was 55% (95% confidence interval: 25.2-77.4). Six of the 22 patients who retained the eye (27%) had useful vision (20/200 or better). CONCLUSIONS: A second course of PBRT for recurrent uveal melanoma to total doses between 118 and 140 CGE was associated with a relatively good probability of local control and a low enucleation rate. Although most patients lost vision, the majority were able to retain the reirradiated eye. Further evaluation is needed to assess metastasis-free survival of additional proton irradiation vs. enucleation after local recurrence

[Review] [39 refs]	Brachytherapy, California, Californium, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Fast Neutrons, Female, Humans, Neutrons, Oxygen, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Fast-neutron-beam therapy and low-dose-rate fast-neutron intracavitary therapy of cervical carcinoma are effective in producing regression of advanced tumors. However, effectiveness is critically dependent on the schedule by which they are used in combination with fractionated external low-linear-energy-transfer (LET) therapy. Neutron-beam therapy is now alternated frequently with fractionated external radiotherapy (mixed beam). Intracavitary neutron therapy, scheduled before fractionated external-beam photon therapy, was maximally effective. These findings indicate that traditional concepts developed for the use of conventional low-LET therapy may need to be altered to use neutrons for therapy and to achieve improved local control of advanced cancers.

Tandem and ovoids insertions were used and combinations of single and multiple applications along with high dose whole pelvic irradiation. Dosimetric analysis of treated cases for patterns of tissue dose were carried out. Tissue dose for Cf-NT was, in general, high for neutron components in the central pelvis only, and fell off rapidly with distance from the applicators. The majority and balance of therapeutic dose was contributed by low linear energy transfer (LET) high energy photon beam radiation to the whole pelvis. Comparison with fast neutron beam therapy (NBT) isodose curves showed that much more homogeneous neutron dose was delivered to the pelvic tumor and organs by NBT. Complication frequency has been reported to be higher for neutron beam therapy than for Cf-NT. It appears that the higher integral neutron biological dose to normal tissues for NBT compared to intracavitary Cf-NT probably contributed to the frequency of side effects

By revealing a decrease of the N-acetyl-aspartate/choline ratio in the pons, 1H MR spectroscopy anticipated lesions growth on MR imaging. In line with the results in four patients reported in the literature, our observation indicates that external radiation therapy is not effective for intracranial involvement in ECD

We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement

A 20-year-old patient with NF2 presenting deafness due to bilateral acoustic neurinomas and unilateral amaurosis due to a meningioma of the optic nerve developed a pigmented parapapillary choroidal tumor. Despite signs indicating the diagnosis of a melanoma, periodic observation was chosen in order to postpone functional amputation following optic nerve irradiation. The tumor growth was slow during the 5 years that followed, and once progression became rapid, the tumor was treated by accelerated proton beam radiotherapy. One year later, visual acuity diminished due to actinic optic neuropathy and was stabilized at 0.3 for the 2 following years. The tumor presented objective signs of regression, and no sign of metastatic disease was observed. The therapeutic approach in this case provided local control of the tumor while preserving useful visual function

We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor; perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact. All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Another patient had progressive enhancement and low relative cerebral blood volume and flow; biopsy showed necrosis and inflammation. One patient had progressive enhancement and high choline levels (proved anaplastic astrocytoma). In another, T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis); enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up). CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor

The AVM was then treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up angiography 2 years later revealed that the AVM had disappeared completely without neurological deficit. The combination of embolization and proton-beam radiosurgery was curative in this patient with a pontine AVM associated with an aneurysm on the feeding artery, showing that these techniques can be used to treat inoperable vascular lesions safely

Through experience we know that naturally aged ones have higher metabolism than the non-aged ones. Also, the same effect as natural aging can be obtained in various types of spirits or wines by the treatment for a period of time with soft ultrasonic wave (US). In this study, we compared ethanol metabolism in human subjects dosed with non-treated white wine (control = CON) and with US treated wine. Ethanol levels in human sera were followed by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy after administration of wine doses. Experimental results indicated that ethanol metabolism was enhanced 18% in subjects when US treated wine was used rather than when non-treated (CON) was used. Other experiments using rabbits showed that a 20% ethanol-aqueous solution was absorbed 18% more rapidly by the group dosed with US wine than by the CON group. From these experimental facts, it was theorized that ethanol metabolism depends on the rapidity of ethanol absorption in the human body. And it can be concluded that US treatment brings about the same effect on spirits or wines as natural aging

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers

In contrast, the proton beam has Bragg peak, which limits distribution of the beam. The aim of this study was to prove the usefulness of proton irradiation for HCC. METHODS: The proton irradiation was performed in 32 nodular lesions in 24 patients with HCC who had unresectable tumors or serious complications; the proton irradiation was performed either as monotherapy (15 lesions) or as combination therapy to insufficient Lipiodol-targeted chemotherapy (Kodama Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (17 lesions). The energy was 250 MeV, and 50-87 Gy (76.5 +/- 9.5, mean +/- SD) in total was irradiated for a time period of 17-69 days. RESULTS: After 1 year, size reduction was seen in 12 out of 13 lesions (92%) in the monotherapy group and 9 out of 9 lesions (100%) in the combination therapy group; after 2 years, size reduction was seen 4 out of 5 lesions (80%) in the monotherapy group and 5 out of 5 lesions (100%) in the combination therapy group. Local tumor control has being assured for 2 years of the observation, which is continuing for another 2 years. None of the patients have experienced any serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that proton irradiation is a new, safe, and effective therapeutic option in cases of HCC, even in patients with unresectable tumors or those with serious complications

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 394 1H MR spectra were acquired from 100 patients (age 19-74 years; mean and median age, 43 years) before and during 2 years after radiation therapy (the mean absorbed doses calculated for the averaged spectroscopy voxels are similar and close to 20 Gy). RESULTS: Oscillations were observed in choline-containing compounds (Cho)/creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and center of gravity (CG) of the lipid band in the range of 0.7-1.5 ppm changes over time reveal oscillations. The parameters have the same 8-month cycle period; however the CG changes precede the other by 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the oscillative nature of the brain response to irradiation, which may be caused by the blood-brain barrier disruption and repair processes. These oscillations may influence the NMR results, depending on the cycle phase in which the NMR measurements are performed in. The earliest manifestation of radiation injury detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the CG shift

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using multi-leaf collimators (MLC) and helical tomotherapy (HT) are becoming popular modes of treatment delivery and their application and effectiveness continues to be investigated. Presently, there are several treatment planning systems (TPS) that can generate and optimize IMRT plans based on user-defined objective functions for the internal target volume (ITV) and organs at risk (OAR). However, the radiobiological parameters of the different tumours and normal tissues are typically not taken into account during dose prescription and optimization of a treatment plan or during plan evaluation. The suitability of a treatment plan is typically decided based on dosimetric criteria such as dose-volume histograms (DVH), maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation of the dose distribution. For a more comprehensive treatment plan evaluation, the biologically effective uniform dose (D) is applied together with the complication-free tumour control probability (P(+)). Its utilization is demonstrated using three clinical cases that were planned with two different forms of IMRT. In this study, three different cancer types at different anatomical sites were investigated: head and neck, lung and prostate cancers. For each cancer type, a linac MLC-based step-and-shoot IMRT plan and a HT plan were developed. The MLC-based IMRT treatment plans were developed on the Philips treatment-planning platform, using the Pinnacle 7.6 software release. For the tomotherapy HiArt plans, the dedicated tomotherapy treatment planning station was used, running version 2.1.2. By using D as the common prescription point of the treatment plans and plotting the tissue response probabilities versus D for a range of prescription doses, a number of plan trials can be compared based on radiobiological measures. The applied plan evaluation method shows that in the head and neck cancer case the HT treatment gives better results than MLC-based IMRT in terms of expected clinical outcome P(+) of 62.2% and 46.0%, D to the ITV of 72.3 Gy and 70.7 Gy, respectively). In the lung cancer and prostate cancer cases, the MLC-based IMRT plans are better over the clinically useful dose prescription range. For the lung cancer case, the HT and MLC-based IMRT plans give a P(+) of 66.9% and 72.9%, D to the ITV of 64.0 Gy and 66.9 Gy, respectively. Similarly, for the prostate cancer case, the two radiation modalities give a P(+) of 68.7% and 72.2%, D to the ITV of 86.0 Gy and 85.9 Gy, respectively. If a higher risk of complications (higher than 5%) could be allowed, the complication-free tumour control could increase by over 40%, 2% and 30% compared to the initial dose prescription for the three cancer cases, respectively. Both MLC-based IMRT and HT can encompass the often-large ITV required while they minimize the volume of the organs at risk receiving high doses. Radiobiological evaluation of treatment plans may provide an improved correlation of the delivered treatment with the clinical outcome by taking into account the dose-response characteristics of the irradiated targets and normal tissues. There may exist clinical cases, which may look dosimetrically similar but in radiobiological terms may be quite different. In such situations, traditional dose-based evaluation tools can be complemented by the use of P(+)--D diagrams to effectively evaluate and compare treatment plans

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer	
1	868	Epidemiological aspects of hadron therapy: a prospective nationwide study of the Austrian project MedAustron and the Austrian Society of Radiooncology (OEGRO)	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Austria, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research	BACKGROUND: The planned MedAustron hadron therapy facility is designed to compare proton and carbon ion beam therapy under the same technical conditions. For the calculation of the number of potential patients for hadron therapy so far, only epidemiological estimations on cancer incidence are available without inclusion of the percentage of patients routinely referred to conventional radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationwide prospective survey to collect disease and treatment related data on patients receiving conventional radiotherapy at all 12 treatment facilities. Epidemiological cancer incidence (Statistic Austria 1999) were correlated with the number of patients receiving conventional radiotherapy. Based on published clinical and experimental results on proton and carbon ion therapy, a calculation of patient's subgroups suitable for hadron therapy was performed at five European University hospitals involved in the HICAT, CNAO, ETOILE and MEDAustron project. Using the mean values of the University specific percentages per tumour site, the number of potential patients was estimated. RESULTS: In Austria, a total of 3783 patients started radiotherapy during the study period of 3 months resulting in an approximated number of 15132 patients per year. The number of potential patients was estimated to 2044 per year, representing 5.6% of all newly diagnosed cancer patients and 13.5% of all irradiated cancer patients. CONCLUSION: There is a clear place for a hadron therapy facility in Austria, based on pattern of care in radiotherapy, cancer incidence and indications	
0	120	A preliminary comparative treatment planning study for radiotherapy of age-related maculopathy	Electrons, Humans, Macula Lutea/ra [Radiography], Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Macular Degeneration/ra [Radiography], Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Optic Chiasm/ra [Radiography], Optic Chiasm/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve/ra [Radiography], Optic Nerve/re [Radiation Effects], Photons, Protons, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: We present a comparative planning of different approaches for external radiotherapy in age-related maculopathies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calculated dose distributions and dose-volume histograms for (a) bilateral irradiation with 6 MV photons, (b) a single lateral-oblique beam using either photons, electrons or protons and (c) an anterior circular proton beam. RESULTS: For lateral photon or electron beams the dose to the lens is usually lower than 10% of the dose to the macula. The entrance doses for bilateral photon beams are about 50% which increase up to 100% at the orbital bone. About 5 mm of optic nerves are irradiated at the maximal dose while the optic chiasma is spared. A single photon beam gives 50% of the dose to the fellow eye. The electron beam spares the fellow eye but gives a rather inhomogeneous dose to the target volume. For a lateral proton beam, 4 mm of optic nerve receives 90% of the dose, the skin dose is at least 70% of the dose to the macula and the lens and the fellow eye are spared. An anterior proton beam gives 90% of the dose to 1 mm of optic nerve and the 50% isodose approaches the periphery of the lens. CONCLUSION: Doses to the critical structures can be dramatically diminished for all the techniques by reducing the beam size, but only if very precise set-up techniques are used. Proton beams are an attractive solution, but the impact of such a choice on the use of proton facilities and on the national health system should be carefully evaluated, as well as the risk of radio-induced secondary neoplasias

[French]	Adult, Brachytherapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Environment, Humans, Lymphoma, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends]	When radiotherapy is employed for central nervous system tumours, several clinical considerations relating to the special normal tissue environment in which they are located deserve recognition. First of all the radiosensitivity of normal brain is nearly equivalent to that of the majority of the primary tumours requiring irradiation. Secondly destroyed normal neural tissue never regenates, but partial recovery is possible following limited injury. Thirdly definition of the target volume is determined mostly by indirect means from a synthesis of neuroradiological findings (C.T. scans, M.R.I.). Finally the rigidity of the intact cranium confers greater clinical significance on mass effects including postradiotherapeutic edema. Most brain tumours respond to external irradiation which may be applied either postoperatively or definitively, e.g. gliomas, lymphomas, medulloblastomas, and metastases. New stereotactic techniques, including radiosurgery, interstitial brachytherapy, and proton beam radiotherapy allow the delivery of larger dose in a limited volume	
1	1443	[Quality control of intensity modulated treatments in radiotherapy]. [French]	France, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Quality Control, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Time	Since January 2001, radiotherapy treatments with modulated intensity beams (IMRT) have started at the Centre Oscar-Lambret. This paper presents the tests and measurements made before the clinical implementation as well the quality control performed before each routine treatment. We use the treatment planning system Helax-TMS (MDS-Nordion) and the Primus accelerator (Siemens) linked to the Lantis network with Primeview and Simtec modules (Siemens) allowing to deliver intensity modulated beams with Step-and-Shoot technique. A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a "classical" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique. The next step is the real time dosimetry with a portal imager	
1	3550	Proton therapy for pediatric cranial tumors: preliminary report on treatment and disease-related morbidities	Adolescent, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/co [Complications], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Medical Records, Methods, Morbidity, Physical Examination, Pituitary Neoplasms/co [Complications], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Seizures/et [Etiology], Universities	PURPOSE: Accelerated protons were used in an attempt to limit treatment-related morbidity in children with tumors in or near the developing brain, by reducing the integral dose to adjacent normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children treated with protons at Loma Linda University Medical Center between August 1991 and December 1994 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight children, aged 1 to 18 years, were identified as at risk for brain injury from treatment. Medical records, physical examinations, and correspondence with patients, their parents, and referring physicians were analyzed. The investigators tabulated post-treatment changes in pre-treatment signs and symptoms and made judgments as to whether improvement, no change, or worsening related to disease or treatment had supervened. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with clinical findings and radiographic impressions were tabulated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 7 to 49 months (median 25 months). Four instances of treatment-related morbidity were identified. Forty-one instances of site-specific, disease-related morbidity were identified: 15 improved or resolved and 26 remained unchanged after treatment. Four patients had radiographic evidence of local failure. Three of these patients, including two with high-grade glioma, have died. CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related morbidity associated with proton therapy is low. Tumor progression remains a problem when treating certain histologies such as high-grade glioma. Escalating the dose delivered to target volumes may benefit children with tumors associated with poor rates of local control. Long-term follow-up, including neurocognitive testing, is in progress to assess integral-dose effects on cognitive, behavioral and developmental outcomes in children with cranial tumors

[Review] [18 refs]	Enchondromatosis, Enchondromatosis/di [Diagnosis], Fingers/ra [Radiography], Humans, Humerus/ra [Radiography], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Risk, Scapula/ra [Radiography], Skull/pa [Pathology], Syndrome	Maffucci's syndrome is a rare congenital non-inherited condition, characterized by multiple enchondromata, cutaneous haemangiomata and more recently spindle-cell haemangioma-endotheliomata. It is associated with an increased risk of malignancy including intracranial chondrosarcomas. Early diagnosis is crucial; screening patients with Ollier's disease is recommended. The treatment of choice for these intracranial cartilaginous tumours is complete surgical excision but this is often difficult to achieve due to difficult access and relationships with neurovascular structures. An alternative treatment is proton-beam therapy. We report a case of Maffucci's syndrome; illustrating the typical clinical and radiological features as well as the known complications of the condition. [References: 18]	
1	524	Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification	Algorithms, Calibration, Humans, Ions, Male, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation	The aim of this study was to demonstrate how dosimetry with an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) replaced film and ionization chamber measurements for routine pre-treatment dosimetry in our clinic. Furthermore, we described how EPID dosimetry was used to solve a clinical problem. IMRT prostate plans were delivered to a homogeneous slab phantom. EPID transit images were acquired for each segment. A previously developed in-house back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom mid-plane (intersecting the isocenter). Segment dose images were summed to obtain an EPID mid-plane dose image for each field. Fields were compared using profiles and in two dimensions with the y evaluation (criteria: 3%/3 mm). To quantify results, the average gamma (gamma avg), maximum gamma (gamma max), and the percentage of points with gamma < 1(P gamma < 1) were calculated within the 20% isodose line of each field. For 10 patient plans, all fields were measured with EPID and film at gantry set to 0 degrees. The film was located in the phantom coronal mid-plane (10 cm depth), and compared with the back-projected EPID mid-plane absolute dose. EPID and film measurements agreed well for all 50 fields, with (gamma avg) =0.16, (gamma max)=1.00, and (P gamma < 1)= 100%. Based on these results, film measurements were discontinued for verification of prostate IMRT plans. For 20 patient plans, the dose distribution was re-calculated with the phantom CT scan and delivered to the phantom with the original gantry angles. The planned isocenter dose (plan(iso)) was verified with the EPID (EPID(iso)) and an ionization chamber (IC(iso)). The average ratio, (EPID(iso)/IC(iso)), was 1.00 (0.01 SD). Both measurements were systematically lower than planned, with (EPID(iso)/plan(iso)) and (IC(iso)/plan(iso))=0.99 (0.01 SD). EPID mid-plane dose images for each field were also compared with the corresponding plane derived from the three dimensional (3D) dose grid calculated with the phantom CT scan. Comparisons of 100 fields yielded (gamma avg)=0.39, gamma max=2.52, and (P gamma < 1)=98.7%. Seven plans revealed under-dosage in individual fields ranging from 5% to 16%, occurring at small regions of overlapping segments or along the junction of abutting segments (tongue-and-groove side). Test fields were designed to simulate errors and gave similar results. The agreement was improved after adjusting an incorrectly set tongue-and-groove width parameter in the treatment planning system (TPS), reducing (gamma max) from 2.19 to 0.80 for the test field. Mid-plane dose distributions determined with the EPID were consistent with film measurements in a slab phantom for all IMRT fields. Isocenter doses of the total plan measured with an EPID and an ionization chamber also agreed. The EPID can therefore replace these dosimetry devices for field-by-field and isocenter IMRT pre-treatment verification. Systematic errors were detected using EPID dosimetry, resulting in the adjustment of a TPS parameter and alteration of two clinical patient plans. One set of EPID measurements (i.e., one open and transit image acquired for each segment of the plan) is sufficient to check each IMRT plan field-by-field and at the isocenter, making it a useful, efficient, and accurate dosimetric tool	
1	76	Radioimmunotherapy with alpha-emitting nuclides. [Review] [68 refs]	Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Animals, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage	This review discusses the application of alpha particle-emitting radionuclides in targeted radioimmunotherapy. It will outline the production and chemistry of astatine-211, bismuth-212, lead-212, actinium-225, bismuth-213, fermium-255, radium-223 and terbium-149, which at present are the most promising alpha-emitting isotopes available for human clinical use. The selective cytotoxicity offered by alpha particle-emitting radioimmunoconstructs is due to the high linear energy transfer and short particle path length of these radionuclides. Based upon the pharmacokinetics of alpha particle-emitting radioimmunoconstructs, both stochastic and conventional dosimetric methodology is discussed, as is the preclinical and initial clinical use of these radionuclides conjugated to monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of human neoplasia.

A technique was developed in which the air-activation production rates are used to evaluate the concentration of radioactive gas in the treatment room and the dose received by the technologist who operates the accelerator. It was found that for typical operating conditions of medical accelerators, the dose received by personnel entering the treatment room is negligible compared to the maximum permissible dose limit	
0	396	Recurrence rates and analysis of close or positive margins in patients treated without re-excision before radiation for breast cancer	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Carcinoma in Situ/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma in Situ/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma in Situ/su [Surgery], Carcinoma,Ductal/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Ductal/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Ductal/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Mammography, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Particle Accelerators, Pennsylvania, Radiation Oncology, Receptors,Estrogen/an [Analysis], Recurrence, Reoperation/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Risk, Time Factors	PURPOSE: This study examines the risk of local recurrence in a group of patients accepted for radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery despite having a close or positive resection margin. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by radiation with a nonnegative margin < or =2 mm from January 1974 to September 2001. The median age was 61 years. Margins were positive in 29% and close (< or =2 mm) in 71%. The median dose was 64 to 66 Gy. The median follow up was 5.9 years. RESULTS: The number of resection margins close or positive was 1 in 73% of patients, 2 in 14%, 3 in 1%, and unknown in 12%. The margin location was 23% anterior, 24% posterior, 12% medial, 12% lateral, 17% superior, and 12% inferior. Reasons for not reexcising were advanced age/comorbidities in 7%, anterior location under skin in 25%, posterior location to muscle in 15%, focal involvement in 13%, no extensive intraductal component in 5%, surgeon refusal in 15%, and patient refusal in 20%. There was a strong association between an anterior or posterior margin location and the rationale of no additional breast tissue at the margin to reexcise before radiation. The risk of local recurrence at 5 and 10 years was 3% and 5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Further research of close and positive margins is needed to validate features identified in this series, particularly nonbreast tissue anatomic margins, that are associated with low risks of local recurrence after radiation	
1	3558	The use of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in the assessment of patients with head and neck and other superficial human malignancies	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/di [Diagnosis], Environment, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Humans, Liposarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Models,Structural, Neck, Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Pennsylvania, Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Sarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Soft Tissue Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Thigh, Time, Universities	The proper demarcation of diseased tissue is important for radiation therapy planning and treatment. The volume to be irradiated is usually identified on radiographs or on x-ray computed tomography (CT) sections. Magnetic resonance (MR)-derived images of the proton T2 relaxation times in small pixel elements, typically 0.5 mm2 or less, provide significantly sharper differentiation between normal and diseased tissue. The T2 values in tissue depend on the tissue composition, histologic condition, and physiologic environment within the tumor. Furthermore, for many tumors the histogram of T2 values has a clear biphasic distribution suggesting that T2 maps may be useful for the identification of necrotic or hypoxic regions within tumors. The distribution of T2 values within the tumor bed shows the general pattern that the T2 values are elevated with a range greater than that seen in normal muscle. Elevated T2 values are not by themselves diagnostic of malignancy; however, they demonstrate the heterogeneity of the microenvironment present within a tumor. The spatial distribution of T2 values is being explored as a method for computer assistance in the delineation of the target volume for treatment planning. In addition, MR P-31 spectroscopic examinations were performed on 30 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Although hampered by muscle contamination in some P-31 spectra obtained with surface coil profile localization techniques, significant trends can still be appreciated in our data. These trends include the following: (1) the P-31 spectra from malignant tissue have well-resolved spectral lines in the upfield region that correspond to Pi, phosphomonoester (PME), and phosphodiester (PDE) not usually seen in normal muscle; (2) the PDE/B-ATP and PME/B-ATP ratios are greater than unity in all cases; and (3) most of the tumors have higher PME peaks than PDE peaks. The P-31 spectra from patients treated with ionizing radiation changed during and after therapy. Some of the changes could be associated with alteration of the tumor metabolic activity or synthesis and breakdown of lipoproteins. These studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies may be useful for both radiotherapy treatment planning and the noninvasive monitoring of patients both before and during treatment

1	3568	Correlation of visual field, treatment fields, and dose in helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma	Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Photography, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Research, Scotoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Fields	We correlated predicted radiation distributions in 29 patients with uveal melanoma (treated with 5,000 to 8,000 rads of helium ion therapy) with fundus photography and visual field deficits. The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis with multivariate analysis using life tables and Cox proportional hazard models in addition to other nonparametric techniques. PATIENTS: All patients with a noncataractous other eye and adequate dosimetry data who were treated with helium ion irradiation. RESULTS: Significant cataracts (grade 3+ or 4+ on a 0 to 4+ scale) developed in 129 patients (44%). The risk of cataract development peaked at 3 years (25% per person-year) and then declined to a sustained level of 7% to 9% per year after 7 years. In multivariate analysis, the percentage of lens included in the treatment port was the predominant predictive correlate with time to significant cataract (relative risk of 2.97 for a 25% increase in the percentage of lens in the treatment port). Patient age, preexisting cortical opacity, and ultrasound tumor height were also significant; ciliary body involvement and tumor dose had smaller effects. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated an increased rate of cataractogenesis with each increment of the percentage of lens in the treatment port; when more than half of the lens was in the beam, the risk of cataract exceeded 90% within 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Cataract development after helium ion irradiation is a function of the amount of the lens in the beam. Unlike neovascular glaucoma that develops mainly in the first few years after treatment, cataract continues to develop during the entire length of follow-up

The current paradigm requires stereotactic head ring placement for the patient's first fraction. The stereotactic coordinates and treatment plan are determined relative to this head ring. The IRLEDs are attached to the patient via a maxillary bite plate, and the position of the IRLEDs relative to linac isocenter is saved to file. These positions are then recalled for each subsequent treatment to position the patient for fractionated therapy. The purpose of this article was to report a method of predicting the desired IRLED locations without need for the invasive head ring. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To achieve the goal of frameless optic-guided radiotherapy, a method is required for direct localization of the IRLED positions from a CT scan. Because it is difficult to localize the exact point of light emission from a CT scan of an IRLED, a new bite plate was designed that contains eight aluminum fiducial markers along with the six IRLEDs. After a calibration procedure to establish the spatial relationship of the IRLEDs to the aluminum fiducial markers, the stereotactic coordinates of the IRLED light emission points are determined by localizing the aluminum fiducial markers in a stereotactic CT scan. RESULTS: To test the accuracy of direct CT determination of the IRLED positions, phantom tests were performed. The average accuracy of isocenter localization using the IRLED bite plate was 0.65 +/- 0. 17 mm for these phantom tests. In addition, the optic-guided system has a unique compatibility with the stereotactic head ring. Therefore, the isocentric localization capability was clinically tested using the stereotactic head ring as the absolute standard. The ongoing clinical trial has shown the frameless system to provide a patient localization accuracy of 1.11 +/- 0.3 mm compared with the head ring. CONCLUSION: Optic-guided radiotherapy using IRLEDs provides a mechanism through which setup accuracy may be improved over conventional techniques. To date, this optic-guided therapy has been used only as a hybrid system that requires use of the stereotactic head ring for the first fraction. This has limited its use in the routine clinical setting. Computation of the desired IRLED positions eliminates the need for the invasive head ring for the first fraction. This allows application of optic-guided therapy to a larger cohort of patients, and also facilitates the initiation of extracranial optic-guided radiotherapy	
1	1521	In vivo determination of extra-target doses received from serial tomotherapy.[see comment]	Gonads/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Luminescence, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Risk, Sternum/re [Radiation Effects]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform in-vivo measurements of extracranial doses received by patients undergoing serial tomotherapy of the head and neck. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) plans were designed for nine patients using the CORVUS treatment planning system (NOMOS Corp.). These plans were delivered using a tertiary collimator dedicated for serial tomotherapy attached to a 10-MV linear accelerator. For each patient, one optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) was placed on the sternum and one on the lower abdomen. The OSLDs were then processed, thereby estimating the in vivo absorbed doses to the sternum and gonads as a function of distance from the treatment site. RESULTS: The OSLDs were shown to measure known doses to within 5%, thereby validating their accuracy for this dose and energy range. In the patient studies, the dose received by the OSLDs varied in direct proportion to the number of monitor units delivered and inversely with the distance from the target volume; the patient dose at a distance of 15 cm from the target is approximately 0.4% of the total monitor units delivered, and drops to below 0.1% of the total MUs at approximately 40 cm from the center of the target. The average sternal dose was 1353 mSv and the average abdominal dose was 327 mSv for an average prescribed dose of 60.1 Gy. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the inefficient treatment delivery that on average required 9.9 MU/0.01 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: While IMRT reduces the normal tissue volume in the high-dose region, it also increases the overall monitor units delivered, and hence the whole-body dose, when compared with conventional treatment delivery. As has been noted in existing literature, these increases in whole-body dose from radiotherapy delivery may increase the likelihood of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of secondary malignancies from IMRT delivery, and compare this relative risk against the potential benefits of decreased normal tissue complication probabilities

The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy

This evaluation was performed by measurement of dosimetric characteristics of the GRID radiation field in parallel opposed and single beam geometry. The limitations of the parallel opposed technique in terms of field size and tumor thickness have been evaluated for the conditions of acceptable spatial modulation. The results of this investigation have demonstrated an increase in therapeutic advantage for the parallel opposed technique over the single beam method when treating a deep seated tumor

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four A-T (ARO, BMA, CSA and RJO) and two control (JAC and KKB3) LCL were exposed to doses of up to 4Gy of accelerated nitrogen ions (32-45 MeV/u, 8-12Gy/min). For comparative purposes X-ray irradiation (1.36 Gy/min) was also performed. The induction of apoptosis was studied 0-48 h after irradiation with the use of two methods: (1) monitoring of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA fragments by field inversion pulse gel electrophoresis (FIGE); and (2) morphological characterization ofapoptotic cells after fluorescent staining. In parallel, cell-cycle distribution, monitored by DNA flow cytometry, as well as measurements of p53/p21(WAF1) protein levels by Western blots, were investigated in these cells. RESULTS: High-LET radiation-induced apoptosis and G2/M-arrest in both A-T and control LCL. No significant increase in the amount of p53/p21(WAF1) proteins preceded apoptosis in control or in A-T LCL after high-LET irradiation. However, low-LET radiation did induce significant enhanced levels of p53 proteins in control but not in A-T LCL. CONCLUSIONS: LCL from both A-T homozygous and unaffected healthy individuals undergo apoptosis without accumulation of p53/p21(WAF1) proteins after exposure to high-LET radiation. In contrast, low-LET radiation induces apoptosis and significantly increases levels of p53 protein in control but not in A-T LCL

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 37 consecutive patients treated with stereotactic radiation therapy for acoustic neuroma. All patients had progressive tumors, progressive symptoms, or both. Mean tumor diameter was 2.3 cm (range 0.8-3.3) on magnetic resonance (MR) scan. Dentate patients were given a dose of 5x4 Gy or 5x5 Gy and edentate patients were given a dose of 1x10 Gy or 1x12.50 Gy prescribed to the 80% isodose. All patients were treated with a single isocenter. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up period of 25 months (range 12-61), the actuarial local control rate at 5 years was 91% (only 1 patient failed). The actuarial rate of hearing preservation at 5 years was 66% in previously-hearing patients. The actuarial rate of freedom from trigeminal nerve toxicity was 97% at 5 years. No patient developed facial nerve toxicity or other complications. CONCLUSION: In this unselected series, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy and linear accelerator-based radiosurgery give excellent local control in acoustic neuroma. It combines a high rate of preservation of hearing with a very low rate of other toxicity, although follow-up is relatively short

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1984 to 31st December 1998, 739 female patients were operated in our institution, diagnosed as having infiltrating breast cancer. One hundred and eighty-eight patients (25.43%) received conservative treatment and they were followed up until December 2003. RESULTS: Average age when diagnosed was 50.42 years old (24-87 years). 53.19% of the patients were premenopausal. After a median follow-up of 129 months (60-198 months), 13 women (6.91%) presented local -regional recurrence and the disease-free time was 48.4 months (8-108 months). Global survival rate was 83.5% and disease free survival rate was 80.85%. CONCLUSIONS: The management of choice for early stage (I and II) infiltrating breast cancer is nowadays conservative, with a low local-regional recurrence rate and survival rate that are comparable to radical mastectomy, according to the literature. It's a safe and efficient method that let us preserve the breast with a good esthetical result. In selected cases, when a regional recurrence occurs, a second conservative management is possible with a good control of the disease, although the most widely accepted treatment in these cases is total mastectomy

[Review] [28 refs]	Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/th [Therapy], Humans, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Base Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Our purpose was to discuss the optimal treatment and outcomes for patients with skull base chordomas. METHODS: We reviewed the pertinent literature for this study. RESULTS: Skull base chordomas usually arise in the clivus and are rarely completely resectable. Therefore, most are treated with radiotherapy (RT). Because of the risk of severe late complications, the dose is often limited with conventional photon RT, and the probability of cure is low. Proton RT alone or combined with photon RT (proton/photon RT) offers the advantage of improved dose distribution and the ability to treat the tumor to a higher dose without exceeding normal tissue tolerance. The 10-year local control rate after proton/photon RT is approximately 40% to 50%. The probability of local control is related to minimum tumor dose and dose inhomogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Skull base chordoma is a rare neoplasm that is rarely cured after surgery alone or combined with conventional RT. Proton/photon RT offers the advantage of increasing the tumor dose while minimizing the dose to normal tissues, thus reducing the risk of late complications. The optimal treatment may be photon/proton RT alone or combined with a gross total resection, when feasible. 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. [References: 28]

The effect on scattered neutron dose equivalent to the fetus of changing the incident proton beam energy, aperture size, beam location, and air gap between the beam delivery snout and skin was studied for both a small field snout and a large field snout. Measurements of the fetus scattered neutron dose equivalent were made by placing a neutron bubble detector 10 cm below the umbilicus of an anthropomorphic Rando phantom enhanced by a wax bolus to simulate a second trimester pregnancy. The neutron dose equivalent in milliSieverts (mSv) per proton treatment Gray increased with incident proton energy and decreased with aperture size, distance of the fetus representative point from the field edge, and increasing air gap. Neutron dose equivalent to the fetus varied from 0.025 to 0.450 mSv per proton Gray for the small field snout and from 0.097 to 0.871 mSv per proton Gray for the large field snout. There is likely to be no excess risk to the fetus of severe mental retardation for a typical proton treatment of 80 Gray to the mother since the scattered neutron dose to the fetus of 69.7 mSv is well below the lower confidence limit for the threshold of 300 mGy observed for the occurrence of severe mental retardation in prenatally exposed Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, based on the linear no threshold hypothesis, and this same typical treatment for the mother, the excess risk to the fetus of radiation induced cancer death in the first 10 years of life is 17.4 per 10,000 children

Some adverse effects such as optic neuropathy can compromise the visual outcome. We were interested in determining the risk factors for radiation papillopathy. Since there is currently no effective therapy, this is an interesting way to improve prevention of optic neuropathy. Six hundred sixty-two eyes had more than 24 month follow-up after proton-beam irradiation for uveal melanoma. In five hundred twenty-two cases, the clinical examination of the optic nerve head by ophthalmoscopy was possible. One-hundred eleven optic discs were pathologic, whereas 411 remained disease-free. Retrospective study of these two groups allowed to quantify the risk factors for optic neuropathy. The irradiation of more than 2mm of optic nerve at 30 Grays-equivalents appeared to be the major risk factor for optic neuropathy. For a given irradiation dose, the observed pattern of clinical responses was heterogeneous. These results are discussed and compared to the previous published reports. Visual results and life prognosis are also discussed, considering the optic nerve head status. Proton-beam therapy can preserve the optic nerve when the tumor location allows to keep it away from the irradiation-field. Patients must be informed about the risk of optic neuropathy after proton-beam irradiation

The patients were classified as Stage Ib (1 patient), Stage IIa (8 patients), Stage IIb (5 patients), and Stage IVa (5 patients). Treatment resulted in a complete response in 100% (14/14) of patients with Stage Ib, IIa, and IIb disease, and a CR in 60% (3/5) of patients with Stage IVa disease. The Stage Ib and IIa patients had an overall survival of 100% and a disease-free survival of 44% at 6 years. Four of the five patients with Stage IIb CTCL relapsed within 3 months after completing TSEB + TNI with an overall survival in the group of 40% at 5 years. The Stage IVa patients all relapsed within 7 months and died of their disease within 50 months of completing treatment. The acute effects of TSEB + TNI were well tolerated, but three patients developed second malignancy (lung, kidney and skin) and one patient developed myelodysplasia, possibly the result of radiotherapy

Patients with locally advanced cancer frequently are included in clinical trials that examine treatment for patients at high risk for relapse based on presenting prostate-specific antigen, high Gleason score, or advanced clinical stage. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that men with localized prostate cancer benefit from high-dose radiation therapy delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or proton beam therapy. Most importantly, neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy have significantly improved outcomes in men with locally advanced or high-risk prostate cancer. Although questions remain regarding the optimal timing and duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy, a combination of long-term androgen deprivation started before radiation therapy and continued for 2 years represents a North American standard of care for this patient population.

In osteogenesis imperfecta hyperplastic heterotopic ossification can be induced by hyperplastic callus formation caused by trauma or operation. Heterotopic ossifications can be found in numerous benign diseases. The successful use of low dose radiotherapy in the treatment of heterotopic ossifications is well-known from the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated two children (a 13-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy) with heterotopic ossifications of the lower extremities in osteogenesis imperfecta type IV (Lobstein) with a low dose irradiation (10 x 1 Gy, respectively 6 x 1 Gy) under megavoltage conditions. RESULTS: After radiotherapy the children were painfree and the hyperplastic callus was considerably reduced. The previously immobilized patients could partly be mobilized. Thereby it could be contributed to the rehabilitation of the patients. New hyperplastic callus formation was not observed in the irradiated areas so far. CONCLUSION: Analogous to the successful radiation of heterotopic ossifications in other benign diseases radiation therapy seems to be a successful treatment of hyperplastic callus formation in osteogenesis imperfecta. Despite the late risks of radiotherapy radiation treatment of benign diseases in children might be indicated

It utilizes an accelerator therapy beam, delivered with 200 degrees gantry rotation, and captured by an electronic portal imager to account for organ motion and setup variations. Although the patient dose exposure from a single volumetric MV-CBCT imaging procedure is comparable to that from standard double-exposure orthogonal portal images, daily image localization procedures can result in a significant dose increase to healthy tissue. A technique to incorporate the daily dose, from a MV-CBCT imaging procedure, in the IMRT treatment planning optimization process was developed. A composite IMRT plan incorporating the total dose from the CB was optimized with the objective of ensuring uniform target coverage while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. One head and neck cancer patient and four prostate cancer patients were planned and treated using this technique. Dosimetric results from the prostate IMRT plans optimized with or without CB showed similar target coverage and comparable sparing of bladder and rectum volumes. Average mean doses were higher by 1.6 +/- 1.0 Gy for the bladder and comparable for the rectum (-0.3 +/- 1.4 Gy). In addition, an average mean dose increase of 1.9 +/- 0.8 Gy in the femoral heads and 1.7 +/- 0.6 Gy in irradiated tissue was observed. However, the V65 and V70 values for bladder and rectum were lower by 2.3 +/- 1.5% and 2.4 +/- 2.1% indicating better volume sparing at high doses with the optimized plans incorporating CB. For the head and neck case, identical target coverage was achieved, while a comparable sparing of the brain stem, optic chiasm, and optic nerves was observed. The technique of optimized planning incorporating doses from daily online MV-CBCT procedures provides an alternative method for imaging IMRT patients. It allows for daily treatment modifications where other volumetric tomographic imaging techniques may not be feasible and/or available and where accurate patient localization with a high degree of precision is required

Even after complete surgical resection, local relapses are frequent. Postoperative radiotherapy is therefore usually indicated. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a new technique that helps creating dose distributions that conform closely to the target volume while maximally sparing the organs at risk. This results in the possibility of applying escalated doses to the target while still keeping the incidence of side effects low. What is especially appealing is the possibility of shaping the dose distribution within the target in such a way that areas with a presumably high tumor cell load receive increased doses, a concept which is best described by the term "integrated boost". We present the case of a patient with a sinunasal carcinoma and describe the implications of the clinical implementation of this technique

Eligible patients were those receiving 3000 rad or more to the mediastinum and no chemotherapy prior to the radiation. During the study period, 13 patients developed symptomatic pericarditis. The interval post treatment to the development of symptoms was six to 34 months. The incidence of pericarditis was studied as a function of: (1) the dose of radiation at a depth of 2 cm, 5 cm and the midplane of the mediastinum; (2) the ratio of anterior to posterior weighting of dose; (3) the presence or absence of intrathoracic tumor; (4) the size of the tumor when present; and (5) the fraction of the heart exposed to the radiation beam. There was a significant increase in the incidence of pericarditis with an increased dose of radiation at 2 cm, 5 cm and midplane depths and also with the presence of a large intrathoracic tumor. A reduction in mediastinal dose is recommended

The few previous reports of radiosurgical efficacy have been limited by small numbers, short follow-up, or lack of attention to the full spectrum of end points, including neurological disability. In an attempt to elucidate the risk-to-benefit ratio of radiosurgery for cavernous malformations, we undertook a retrospective analysis of of 95 patients with 98 lesions treated by the late Raymond N. Kjellberg. METHODS: Patients were followed for an average of 5.4 years (range, 0.3-12.3 yr), and data regarding hemorrhage, seizure, neurological disability, and incidence of radiation-induced complications were gathered. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a drop in annual hemorrhage rates from 17.3% per lesion per year before treatment to 4.5% per lesion per year after a latency period of 2 years. Improvement in seizure control was evident. However, a 16% incidence of permanent neurological deficit and a 3% mortality rate were attributable to radiographically confirmed radiation-induced complications. Neurological disability scores, measured by the modified Rankin disability scale, indicated a significant decline in neurological functioning during the follow-up interval, a result of the combined effects of radiation-related injury, hemorrhage, and clinical progression of the lesion. CONCLUSION: We conclude that although radiosurgery does seem to reduce hemorrhage, there is potential for complications and continued lesion progression after radiosurgery. These risks and benefits must be carefully balanced against the natural history of untreated lesions if the use of radiosurgery is considered

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred and twenty-one cases of NPC, treated in the Cancer Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), with computed tomography scanning before initial radiotherapy, are analyzed. Important prognostic factors that form the basis of the new staging system are screened out by means of Cox model and clinical experiences. Survival curves of various kinds of T and N stages are compared by computer simulation. A new staging system is proposed by studying the traditional staging systems such as the AJC, UICC, Ho's and Changsha systems. RESULTS: According to the new staging criteria, the 5-year survival rates for Stages I-IV are 89.7%, 75.9%, 51.3%, and 22.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new clinical staging for NPC based on a large amount of cases multivariate analysis is satisfactory and widely used in China

Hypophyseal tumors, tumors of the cavernous sinus, arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area, and arteriovenous malformations are irradiated at the N. N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR, AMS using the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Methods of "piercing" irradiation and methods with the use of Bragg's peak are being developed. At present over 200 patients with hormonally active hypophyseal tumors, 30 patients with tumors of the cavernous sinus, 23 patients with deep seated arteriovenous malformations, and 10 patients with spontaneous arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area have been irradiated. This method seems to hold promise in neurosurgical practice. Extension of the range of clinical applications of proton beam therapy in neurosurgery requires the development of various techniques of irradiation, all possible approaches to various targets on the basis of contemporary methods of computerized diagnosis, topometry and irradiation design

Only two prior cases have been treated conservatively, one using chemotherapy and the other using photocoagulation and proton beam irradiation. Our patient was unique since she was the first to have conservative therapy by implantation of a radon ring. Initial results were clinically promising, although repeated ultrasound testing actually showed minimal decrease in tumor size. Subsequently, a large retinal detachment caused marked visual deterioration. Persistent pain from neovascular glaucoma prompted later enucleation, and silver staining as well as electron microscopic studies were performed on the choroidal lesion. It was found that the radon ring had little histologic effect on the viability of the tumor cells. This contrasted with an earlier report of the successful treatment of two much smaller choroidal lesions, using external proton beam irradiation. From our pathologic evaluation, we believe that the metastatic carcinoid tumor should be considered relatively radioresistant	
1	2026	Respiratory gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy	Carbon, Diaphragm, Fluoroscopy, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Light, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Motion, Movement, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: In order to reduce the treatment margin of the moving target due to breathing, we developed a gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The motion of a patient due to respiration is detected by the motion of the body surface around the chest wall. A respiratory sensor was developed using an infrared light spot and a position-sensitive detector. A timing signal to request a beam is generated in response to the respiration waveform, and a carbon beam is extracted from the synchrotron using a RF-knockout method. CT images for treatment planning are taken in synchronization with the respiratory motion. For patient positioning, digitized fluoroscopic images superimposed with the respiration waveform were used. The relation between the respiratory sensor signal and the organ motion was examined using digitized video images from fluoroscopy. The performance of our gated system was demonstrated by using the moving phantom, and dose profiles were measured in the direction of phantom motion. RESULTS: The timing of gate-on is set at the end of the expiratory phase, because the motion of the diaphragm is slower and more reproducible than during the inspiratory phase. The signal of the respiratory sensor shows a phase difference of 120 milliseconds between lower and upper locations on the chest wall. The motion of diaphragm is delayed by 200 milliseconds from the respiration waveform at the lower location. The beam extraction system worked according to the beam on/off logic for gating, and the gated CT scanner performed well. The lateral penumbra size of the dose profile along the moving axis was distinguishably decreased by the gated irradiation. The ratio of the nongated to gated lateral fall-off was 4.3, 3.5, and 2. 0 under the stroke of 40.0, 29.0, and 13.0 mm respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed a total treatment system of gated irradiation for heavy-ion radiotherapy. We found that with this system the target margin along the body axis could be decreased to 5-10 mm although the target moved twice or three times. Over 150 patients with lung or liver cancer had already been treated by this gated irradiation system by the end of July 1999

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of sequential CT images at every 0.2 s was reconstructed from continuous X-ray projection data accumulated by dynamic helical scanning. At the same time that CT data was acquired, the respiratory signal of the patient and the X-ray on/off signal on CT scanner were recorded. Each CT image was timed according to the phase of respiration waveform. Conversion of the CT number to the water equivalent path length (WEL) was performed with our treatment planning system that included a conversion table. As an illustration, the CT images of a patient with liver cancer at the right upper lobe were analyzed. The geometric size of the liver and WELs from body surface to isocenter were measured in each CT image. RESULTS: Variations of WEL from body surface to isocenter at the anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior direction were 6.2 mm and 18.9 mm, respectively. Liver size changed by 35.2 mm. However, these variations were shown to be considerably reduced by gated irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: A method using sequential CT images with respiration waveform was proposed. It appeared to be useful in evaluating the uncertainties of the range calculation associated with patient breathing

Comparison is made with 79 patients treated by subtotal surgery alone from 1962-1980. Progression-free survival for 17 patients irradiated after initial incomplete surgery was 88% at 8 years compared with 48% for similar patients treated by surgery alone (p = 0.057). 16 patients incompletely resected at time of first recurrence were irradiated and 78% were progression-free at 8 years while 11% of a similar group treated by surgery alone were progression free (p = 0.001). Long term overall survival was high and similar in both control and study groups. Two patients were irradiated at second recurrence and 1 patient at third recurrence. Twenty-five patients were treated with photons alone and have a median follow-up of 57 months, 6 patients have recurred at doses 45-60 Gy. Eleven patients were treated with combined 10 MV photons and 160 MV protons utilizing 3-D treatment planning. These patients have been followed for a median of 53 months and none have failed to date. Eight of 11 received 54-60.4 Gy and 3/11 greater than 64.48 Gy. Sex, age, pathology grade and score, surgery and timing of radiation therapy were not associated with significant differences in failure patterns within the irradiated study group (p less than 0.1). Complications have been seen in 6 irradiated patients	
1	3599	Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors: spinal theca irradiation	Bone Marrow, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Growth/re [Radiation Effects], Heart, Humans, Liver, Lung, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Neuroectodermal Tumors,Primitive/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Spine/re [Radiation Effects], Survival, Switzerland, Thyroid Gland, Universities, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conventional postoperative photon-beam radiotherapy to the spine in children with medulloblastoma/PNET is associated with severe late effects. This morbidity (growth and developmental) is related to the exit dose of the beams and is particularly severe in young children. With the purpose of reducing this toxicity, a dosimetric study was undertaken in which proton therapy was compared to standard megavoltage photon treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The results of a comparative dosimetric study are presented in such a way that the dose distribution achievable with a posterior modulated 100 MeV proton beam (spot scanning method) is compared with that of a standard set of posterior 6 MV x-ray fields. The potential improvements with protons are evaluated, using dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the target as well as the dose to the vertebral bodies (growth plates), lungs, heart, and liver. RESULTS: The target (i.e., the spinal dural sac) received the full prescribed dose in both treatment plans. However, the proportions of the vertebral body volume receiving > or = 50% of the prescribed dose were 100 and 20% for 6 MV x-rays and protons, respectively. For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET. The potential bone marrow and growth arrest sparing effects make this approach specially attractive for intensive chemotherapy protocols and for very young children. Sparing the thyroid gland, the posterior heart wall, and the gonads may be additional advantages in assuring a long-term posttreatment morbidity-free survival	
1	3600	Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors: reduction of the supratentorial target volume	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Eye, Humans, Methods, Morbidity, Neuroectodermal Tumors,Primitive/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Recurrence, Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: One of the components of radiotherapy (RT) in medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors is the prophylactic irradiation of the whole brain (WBI). With the aim of reducing late neuropsychologic morbidity a CT-scan-based dosimetric study was undertaken in which treatment was confined mainly or exclusively to supratentorial sites considered at high risk for disease recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comparative dosimetric study is presented in which a three field (two laterals and one posterior) proton plan (spot scanning method) is compared with a two-field conventional WBI 6 MV x-ray plan, to a 6-field "hand-made" 6 MV x-ray plan, and to a computer-optimized 9-field "inverse" 15 MV x-ray plan. For favorable patients, 30 Gy were delivered to the ventricles and main cisterns, the subfrontal and subtemporal regions, and the posterior fossa. For the unfavorable patients, 10 Gy WBI preceeded a boost to 30 Gy to the same treatment volume chosen for favorable patients. The dose distribution was evaluated with dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the targets as well as the dose to the nontarget brain and optical structures. In addition, the risks of radiation-related late neuropsychologic effects after WBI were collected from the literature and used to predict normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) for an intelligence quotient deficit after treatment with photon or proton beams. RESULTS: Proton beams succeeded better in reducing the dose to the brain hemispheres and eye than any of the photon plans. A 25.1% risk of an IQ score <90 was predicted after 30 Gy WBI. Almost a 10% drop in the predicted risk was observed when using proton beams in both favorable and unfavorable patients. However, predicted NTCPs for both optimized photon plans ("hand made" and "inverse") were only slightly higher (0.3-2.5%) than those of proton beams. An age-modifying factor was introduced in the predictive NTCP model to assess for IQ differences in relation with age at irradiation. Children with ages between age 4 to 8 benefitted most from the dose reduction in this exercise (similar NTCP predictions for both proton and "inverse" plans). CONCLUSION: Modulated proton beams may help to significantly reduce the irradiation of normal brain while optimally treating the supratentorial subsites at higher risk for relapse. A decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons and both optimized proton plans compared to WBI	
0	3601	Pediatric medulloblastoma: radiation treatment technique and patterns of failure.[see comment]	Adolescent, Brain, Cerebellar Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Medulloblastoma/ra [Radiography], Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Medulloblastoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Multivariate Analysis, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Risk, Supratentorial Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival, Survival Analysis, Switzerland, Temporal Lobe, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Failure, Universities	PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related, and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991. Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19 children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36 children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size, or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

Five- and 10-year adjusted actuarial survival rates for all patients were 97 and 95%, respectively. The tumor recurred in the larynx and/or neck in 16% of patients with T1a (one cord involved) and 23% of the patients with T1b (both vocal cords involved) disease. Radiation failures were surgically salvaged in 89% of patients with T1a disease without anterior commissure involvement, in 60% of those with T1a disease with anterior commissure involvement and in 57% of those with T1b disease. Tumor was ultimately controlled in 97% of the patients with T1a and 90% of the patients with T1b disease. Voice was preserved in 93% of the patients with T1a disease and 77% of patients with T1b disease. Of 121 patients evaluated for voice quality, 77% had good and 22% had fair voice, while only one patient had poor quality of voice. Patients with fair or poor quality voice usually had had salvage hemilaryngectomy. We recommend radiation for all patients with early vocal cord carcinoma

Two phase I/II clinical studies on the carbon beam radiation treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were carried out in our institution from October 1996 to February 1999. The dose-limiting toxicity was found to be radiation pneumonia. In the first protocol, 47 patients received 18 fractions of increasing doses from 59.4 GyE by 10% over 6 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was found to be 95.4 GyE, while the complete tumor control dose was 85.6 GyE. In the second protocol, 34 patients received 9 fractions of in creasing doses from 68.4 GyE by 5% over 3 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was 79.2 GyE, and the complete tumor control dose was > 68.9 GyE. The 4-year survival rate estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 56% for patients receiving the first protocol. Because a higher local control rate was achieved in the second protocol, the 5-year survival rate is estimated to be higher and similar to that achieved after surgery. Another phase II clinical study in patients with stage INSCLC is ongoing. Heavy-particle radiotherapy is a new modality for the treatment of lung cancer which holds promise for the 21st century.

The local control rate, cause-specific survival rate, and overall survival rate of 141 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC were 82%, 58%, and 42%, respectively. Radiation pneumonia was rare (2.1%) and not serious. In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate achieved in 50 patients was 100%, with no radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 60% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beam therapy, excellent local control comparable to that in stage INSCLC has been demonstrated and offers hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer.

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

Radiation pneumonia was not serious and infrequent (2.1%). In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate of 50 patients was 100% without radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 74.0% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beams, excellent local control as in stage I NSCLC has been demonstrated, providing hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer

On the basis on the results, a phase II study using a regimen of four fractions during 1 week was performed. The purpose of the present study was to determine the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2003, 79 patients with 80 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA NSCLC and 60.0 GyE for stage IB NSCLC in four fractions during 1 week, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.8 years. Sixty-two (78.5%) of these patients were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The data were statistically processed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years or until death, with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months, ranging from 2.5 to 72.2 months. The local control rate for all patients was 90% (T1: 98%, T2: 80%). The patients' 5-year lung cancer-specific survival rate was 68% (IA: 87%, IB: 42%). The overall survival was 45% (IA: 62%, IB: 25%). Half of the deaths were attributable to intercurrent diseases. No toxic reactions in the lung greater than grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion beam radiotherapy with a regimen of four fractions during 1 week has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66%) of these were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the data were statistically processed by using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 5 years or until death with a median follow-up time of 59.2 months (range, 6.0-83.0 months). The local control rate for all patients was 94.7%. The patients' 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 75.7% (IA: 89.4; IB: 55.1), and overall survival 50.0% (IA: 55.2; IB: 42.9). No toxic reactions in the lung greater than Grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy, a new treatment modality with superior benefits in terms of quality of life and activity of daily living, has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for Stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

Fifteen patients with urinary malignant tumors were treated by proton irradiation during the period from June, 1985 to March, 1989 at Particle Radiation Medical Center, University of Tsukuba. Four patients were with renal cell carcinoma, five with prostatic cancer and six with bladder cancer. Treatment results were assessed by change in tumor size either three or six months after the irradiation. In all the four cases with renal cell carcinoma, the tumor sizes were found to be unchanged without any enlargement. Of the five cases with prostatic cancer, two showed that the treatment was effective and the tumor sizes in the other three cases were found to be unchanged. In three of the six cases with bladder cancer the tumors disappeared while the treatment was found effective in two other and it did not cause any enlargement of the tumor in the remaining one. Although local control of the tumor was successful in all the cases, one patient with prostatic cancer and three with bladder cancer died of cancer. Various side effects, such as radiation cystitis, were observed. This prospective therapy is expected to replace the conventional photon therapy. However, some improvement is needed to make full use of the advantageous properties in dose distribution. Combination therapy with other general therapy is required for some cases

METHODS: Patients with invasive bladder cancer, stage T2-3N0M0, were included in the study. Intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed with three injections of methotrexate and cisplatin at 3-week intervals. Simultaneously, the patients underwent X-ray irradiation (40 Gy) of the small pelvic space. Where a post-treatment transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy showed no residual tumor, the tumor site was irradiated by a 30 Gy proton beam and the bladder was preserved. Where tumors remained, radical cystectomy was performed. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1996, 42 patients were treated according to this protocol. Post-treatment TUR biopsy and urine cytology showed no residual tumors in 39 of 42 cases (93%). The bladder was preserved in accordance with the study protocol in 36 cases. A median follow-up of 38 months showed 3-year non-recurrence in 72% of bladder-preserved patients and the rate of bladder preservation was 84%. The nine recurrences included eight cases of superficial bladder recurrence. One cancer death occurred among the bladder-preservation patients, giving 3-year survival and cause-specific survival rates of 84% and 100%, respectively. Although bladder function decreased slightly in compliance, bladder capacity was retained in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is useful for bladder preservation in T2-3 locally invasive bladder cancer. Information from more cases and the results of more long-term observations are needed, as is an evaluation of appropriate subject selection and factors associated with quality of life issues, particularly regarding bladder function	
1	950	Dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy for locally advanced head-and-neck cancer.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Dose Fractionation, Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Time	PURPOSE: To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer in a Phase I/II dose escalation clinical trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1994 and February 2002, 48 patients with histologically confirmed malignant gliomas (16 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 32 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical study. The treatment involved the application of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks of XRT, followed by CRT at 8 fractions/2 weeks. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) were administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) concurrently in weeks 1, 4, or 5 of XRT. The carbon ion dose was increased from 16.8 to 24.8 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 10% incremental steps (16.8, 18.4, 20.0, 22.4, and 24.8 GyE, respectively). RESULTS: There was no Grade 3 or higher acute reaction in the brain. The late reactions included four cases of Grade 2 brain morbidity and four cases of Grade 2 brain reaction among 48 cases. The median survival time (MST) of AA patients was 35 months and that of GBM patients 17 months (p = 0.0035). The median progression-free survival and MST of GBM showed 4 and 7 months for the low-dose group, 7 and 19 months for the middle-dose group, and 14 and 26 months for the high-dose group. CONCLUSION: The results of combined therapy using XRT, ACNU chemotherapy, and CRT showed the potential efficacy of CRT for malignant gliomas in terms of the improved survival rate in those patients who received higher carbon doses

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities	
1	722	Comparative treatment planning on localized prostate carcinoma conformal photon- versus proton-based radiotherapy	Femur/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To assess the potential benefit of proton-beam therapy in comparison to 3-D conformal photon therapy and photon- based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma for various stages of disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

The difference which might result from medical treatment seems to have been markedly over-valued. The available and relevant evidence about severe haematopoietic damage in man uncomplicated by tissue necrosis is indeed very scanty. It comes from 20 cases of therapeutic whole-body exposure to gamma rays and from two criticality accidents involving nine subjects, one of whom died, and when exposure was to neutrons as well as gamma rays. The observations suggest a judgment that 4.5 Gy (450 rad) absorbed dose in the bone marrow for energetic and therefore penetrating gamma rays giving reasonably uniform irradiation of the marrow could be regarded as the LD50 in circumstances where those irradiated were protected from thermal radiation and blast damage and from neutrons and beta rays. Examination of all the available experimental data on acute lethality following whole-body exposure to low LET radiation shows a remarkably similar co-efficient of variation of the LD50 in five species of large animal. If the same value is adopted for the human species, a quantitative estimate of the human LD50 can be inferred from the human evidence discussed. This reinforces the judgement that it is about 4.5 Gy. The use of observations after criticality accidents is examined in detail in an Appendix. The Vinca accident does not clearly meet the criteria for relevancy but there is no other instance of death in man from an uncomplicated brief whole-body exposure to ionising radiation where the bone-marrow dose can be estimated, and a possible judgment made of the value for the LD50

There are several methods of managing them. Validity of these methods, however, is not sufficiently studied. We therefore investigated, whether moist skin care with 3% urea lotion will reduce acute radiation skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with carcinomas of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy with curative intent (mean total dose 60 Gy, range: 50-74 Gy) were evaluated weekly for acute skin reactions according to the RTOG-CTC score. In 63 patients, moist skin care with 3% urea lotion was performed. The control group consisted of 25 patients receiving conventional dry skin care. The incidence of grade I, II, and III reactions and the radiation dose at occurrence of a particular reaction were determined and statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. The dose-time relations of individual skin reactions are described. RESULTS: At some point of time during radiotherapy, all patients suffered from acute skin reactions grade I, > 90% from grade II reactions. 50% of patients receiving moist skin care experienced grade I reactions at 26 Gy as compared to 22 Gy in control patients (p = 0.03). Grade II reactions occurred at 51 Gy versus 34 Gy (p = 0.006). Further, 22% of the patients treated with moist skin care suffered from acute skin toxicity grade III as compared to 56% of the controls (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Moist skin care with 3% urea lotion delays the occurrence and reduces the grade of acute skin reactions in percutaneously irradiated patients with head and neck tumors

PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: In 41 patients irradiated for unilateral breast cancer the regular scoring by CTC was done during radiotherapy. In parallel, a total of 4,920 spectrophotometric measurements to determine the skin color were performed at baseline, at the beginning of radiotherapy, and at 20, 40 and 60 Gy. The nonirradiated contralateral breast was used for control measurements. RESULTS: As expected, the skin color (especially red) depended on the radiation dose applied to the skin. The objective spectrophotometric measurements were found to correlate well with the subjective CTC scores. CONCLUSION: For classification of acute radiation toxicity there seems to be no need to replace the common CTC scoring by technical methods

One or more direct or indirect signs of enlargement of the pituitary gland either by hyperplasia, microadenoma, or adenoma occurred in 60 per cent. Most of these cases were unproved as to cell type because they were given proton beam therapy. There were more cases of pituitary enlargement in those with adrenalectomy in comparison to non-adrenalectomy cases and in those with pigmentation in comparison to non-pigmented cases. The high incidence of pituitary gland enlargement in the different phases of this disease supports the importance of this gland in the pathogenesis of primary Cushing's disease. Limitation in correlation of the pituitary fossa to size of the pituitary gland when the latter enlarges only slightly has been discussed	
1	1186	Comparison of a micro-multileaf collimator with a 5-mm-leaf-width collimator for intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Software, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	PURPOSE: To dosimetrically compare a micro-multileaf collimator (minimum leaf width of 3 mm) with the 5-mm-leaf multileaf collimator (MLC) of a standard linear accelerator for stereotactic conformal radiotherapy treatment of intracranial lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service	
1	3619	Is machine energy (4-8 MV) associated with outcome for stage I-II breast cancer patients?

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1968 and 1985, 1624 patients were treated for clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer. The study population was limited to 1380 patients who underwent complete gross excision and received greater than or equal to 60 Gy to the tumor bed. Of these, 1125 were treated on a 4 MV, 153 on a 6 MV, and 102 on an 8 MV linear accelerator. Patients were selected for treatment on the 8 MV machine based on chest wall separations greater than 24 cm. Of patients treated on the 8 MV, netting was used for 42% and bolus was used for 26%. The median dose with bolus was 14 Gy in seven fractions (range: 2-34.2 Gy). Patients treated on the 8 MV accelerator were older, had a higher percentage of clinical T2 tumors, a higher percentage of pathologically positive nodes, and a lower incidence of extensive intraductal component (EIC). Median follow-up times were 130, 153, and 102 months, respectively, for survivors treated on the 4, 6, and 8 MV machines. RESULTS: We analyzed the site and 5-year crude incidence of first failure by machine energy and found the pattern of first failure site (local, nodal, or distant) to be virtually identical for each energy group. Of the local failures, 12 were in the skin of the treated breast, and these failures were evenly distributed by machine energy. We performed a multivariate analysis to adjust for factors known to predict for treatment failure. When adjusted for these other variables, machine energy was not associated with an increased (or decreased) risk of recurrence (RR for 8 MV vs. 4 MV = 0.94, p = 0.7; RR for 6 MV vs. 4 MV = 1.0, p = 0.9). We also analyzed the nature and incidence of treatment complications (rib fracture, radiation pneumonitis, soft tissue necrosis, and brachial plexopathy) and found no significant differences among the three treatment groups when stratified by treatment technique (tangents only vs. three-field). There was also no significant difference in cosmetic outcome at 5 years among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that machine energy over the range of 4 to 8 MV does not significantly affect treatment outcome. Specifically, it was feasible to treat patients with large chest wall separations using an 8 MV machine without an increase in skin recurrences and with the improved dose homogeneity afforded by 8 MV machines as compared with those of lower energies

Group I (194 patients) was given a combination of proton irradiation of the pituitary and sequential zone gamma-ray teletherapy of the skeleton, group II (98) received the first component and group III (162 cases)--the latter component of the modality only. Cumulative survival curves for groups I and II were well approximated by exponential function of the follow-up period; mean survival was 36.4 and 11.4 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. Within a period of about 12 months, survival curves for groups I and III were nearly identical. However, with the increasing number of bony metastases, the group III curve slope tended to match that of group II. Corresponding mean survival for that segment of the curve was 13 months. Mean survival for historic control was 12.1 months. Thus, pronounced and lasting increase in survival was not observed unless the procedures were used together

These patients refuse to go in to surgery or have indications for surgery (183 patients--T(1-4)N(0-3)M(0-1)). This method consists of the combination of the traditional method of the whole breast and/or nodal photon irradiation with local highly concentrated proton irradiation in the dosage iso-equivalent to tumor (proton with energy from 130 to 180 MeV, with stop in the target in notice depth). We used the irradiation of the adenohypophysis with narrow proton beams energy 200 MeV. The aim of the first combination of the components is the selectively influence on the target and the channeling to the tumor and its subclinical substances the dosages sufficient for the total irradiation of tumor with sparing surrounding tissues and parts of body. The goal of irradiation of adenohypophysis with protons is the normalization of its hormonal activity and elimination of factors stimulating growth of tumor cells in case of dishormonal cancer. The suggested method didu't only improve the results of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, but also contributed to the reducing of the emotional stress. We received high results of the patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer of criteria: local control rate (96%), long remission (more then 40%) and 5-year actuarial survival rate (83%).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a radiotherapy technique that uses linear accelerators with multileaf collimators to treat the pelvis and sequentially boost the inguinal regions, while minimizing "hot spots" across the match-line. This was achieved by angling the gantry for the inguinal fields so that their medial borders aligned with the divergence of the posterior pelvic field. Film dosimetry was performed to compare the MSBT with the traditional segmental boost technique, partial transmission block, and photon/electron combination techniques. These treatment techniques were scored on the basis of the dose homogeneity index, defined as the ratio of match-line maximum dose to the average dose at a given depth in the groin treatment area. RESULTS: The values of the dose homogeneity index were the same (1.04) for MSBT and partial transmission block, and 1.21, 1.39, and 1.18 for the segmental boost technique, photon pelvis with electron tags, and photon pelvis with electron boost, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MSBT proved to be technically simple while optimizing dose homogeneity compared with the other techniques and allows for maximum use of the features of modern linear accelerators

In this report, the authors describe three cases with an unusual localized posterior choroidal hemorrhage, which were thought to be choroidal melanomas and referred for proton beam irradiation. These limited hemorrhagic choroidal detachments presented as a dark brown mass of considerable elevation, but were discrete, well localized, and located posterior to the equator. Fluorescein angiography and ultrasonography may be of some value in differentiating these lesions from choroidal melanomas. Serial observations over time will establish the correct diagnosis

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart

To evaluate the effectiveness of fast neutron therapy, mixed neutron-photon fractionated irradiation, on squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, 98 patients with Stage IIIb disease were examined to study the correlation between local control rate and histological types. The local control rate after neutron-mixed beam therapy was 73%, which decreased to 66% with photon irradiation. The five year survival rate was 49% for patients receiving neutron therapy and 49% for those receiving photon therapy. There was no statistical significance between neutron and photon therapy; we then attempted to analyze histological types to check for any gain using neutron therapy. This study was a nonrandomized trial. The preliminary results however, gave us useful information for the next of neutron therapy

Protocols were largely nonrandomized. Some results have been obtained: 1) results with mixed beam studies for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix have been equivocal compared with the photon controls. 2) some trends of local control have been observed in the trial of esophageal cancer, early cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung and malignant melanoma. 3) significant better results were observed in the pancoast type lung cancer and osteo sarcoma which was treated by the systemic multimodal treatment. It is concluded that neutrons are efficacious for certain specific tumor types owing to some biological effects, however the problem of inferior dose distribution was the weakness of neutron therapy at present.

The most favorable clinical results by fast neutron treatment had been revealed in such diseases as follows; salivary gland tumors, prostate cancer, Pancoast type lung cancer, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma. The characteristics of these tumors as to the radiobiological properties and the dose distribution are, 1) relatively slow growing tumors and higher RBE for tumor tissue, and 2) capability of correct delivery of a big radiation doses to the target, without any severe radiation complications. Normal tissue tolerance (NSD formulas) for each tissues were also discussed

However, psychological distress and anxiety related to irradiation are often observed. Purpose of our study was the evaluation of the influence of radiotherapy-induced distress in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and June 1996 in 48 breast cancer patients (31 to 76 years old) treated by breast-conserving surgery adjuvant irradiation with or without systemic therapy was applied. On the first and the last day of radiotherapy they were given a questionnaire (Table 1) which was designed together with psychologists. Covering different situations related to radiotherapy the construction of items are determined by factors with possible influence on psychological distress and perception with regard to irradiation. RESULTS: Most of the women (92%) stated to be well informed about the irradiation and tried to obtain further information about this treatment (83%). 56% tried not to think about radiotherapy and/or to distract themselves (81%). 40% were anxious about the fact to undergo irradiation. In the end of treatment 77% reported to have been anxious only initially or never; only 19% were anxious almost or most of the time. 35% were worried about the expected cosmetic alterations of their breast; only 30% observed acute cosmetic changes. With regard to situation-related distress all patients (100%) stated that the communication with the medical staff made it easier to stand the irradiation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of theoretical considerations our results are explorative in character. However, following statements seem to be important: 1. A large requirement exists to get information about radiotherapy. 2. The patients experience irradiation treatment more positive than initially expected by themselves. 3. With regard to radiotherapy anxiety is reduced during the course of treatment. Here the psychosocial care of the medical staff is an important support for reduction of anxiety

The significance of this effect for cancer risk assessment and radiotherapy treatment planning requires demonstration of its relevance in vivo. The problem in demonstrating the existence of the effect in vivo is that other systemic effects may mask or confound the effect being investigated and it is practically impossible to attribute an effect in a particular cell to a signal produced in another irradiated cell. To approach this problem, an assay has been developed where fragments of human tissue can be irradiated ex vivo and the media harvested and added to unirradiated, clonogenic cells which have a well characterised and stable response to the bystander signal. The variation in the production of a signal from patient to patient can thus be assessed. The results of a study using tissue from over 100 patients attending Beaumont and St Vincent's Hospitals in Dublin for investigation of urological disorders including follow-up after treatment for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and resection of suspect prostatic lesions, are now available. Blood samples from the prostate group were also obtained. The results show that there is variation in the effect of the signal produced by irradiated tissue from different patients. This holds for bladder, prostate and blood. Gender, smoking status and the existence of a malignancy influence the expression of the signal by normal tissue. Male gender, smoking and a pre-existing malignancy all reduce the amount or effect of the signal produced into medium when the tissue is exposed. The effects of exposure to medium containing the signal are transmitted to distant progeny of the exposed cell population. The results may be important not only for understanding radiation risk mechanisms for protection but also for radiotherapy treatment planning where they may open new avenues for development of drugs for combined therapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

Previously, the only treatment that could halt progression of this disease was laser photocoagulation, which was, however, accompanied by immediate reduction in visual acuity. A single narrow proton beam was used to irradiate 45 patients to either 8 or 14 Cobalt Gray Equivalent. The alignment technique and dosimetry of these treatments are described. The proton beam direction, range, and modulation were planned with the assistance of an eye-specific planning program. A single anterior beam was used, with patients looking nasally toward a blinking fixation light at an angle of 30 degrees. Patients were aligned using a light field projected through a slit collimator. Patients' positions were monitored during treatment with a short-focal-length camera. Depth dose in a flat phantom was measured with a small-diameter parallel plate ionization chamber. Lateral profiles were measured at several depths with silver halide film. Each treatment session lasted 15 min, of which 1 min consisted of beam delivery. The proton beam stopped in the orbital cavity, delivering no primary proton dose to the brain. Dose to the center of the lens of the involved eye was less than 0.5% of the dose delivered to the macula. Treatments of SNVMs with proton beams require only a short visit to the hospital, little immobilization effort, and a minimal amount of treatment room and beam time. Compared to previous treatment trials using x-ray beams, the dose to nonocular tissues is reduced significantly

The radiotherapy techniques compared were conventional photon therapy, intensity modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT), conventional electron therapy, intensity/energy modulated electron therapy (IMET) and proton therapy (IMPT).CT images for radiotherapy use from five children, median age 8 and diagnosed with medulloblastoma, were selected for this study. Target volumes and organs at risk were defined in 3-D. Treatment plans using conventional photon therapy, IMXT, conventional electron therapy, IMET and IMPT were set up. The probability of normal tissue complication (NTCP) and the risk of cancer induction were calculated using models with parameters-sets taken from published data for the general population; dose data were taken from dose volume histograms (DVH).Similar dose distributions in the targets were achieved with all techniques but the absorbed doses in the organs-at-risk varied significantly between the different techniques. The NTCP models based on available data predicted very low probabilities for side-effects in all cases. However, the effective mean doses outside the target volumes, and thus the predicted risk of cancer induction, varied significantly between the techniques. The highest lifetime risk of secondary cancers was estimated for IMXT (30%). The lowest risk was found with IMPT (4%). The risks associated with conventional photon therapy, electron therapy and IMET were 20%, 21% and 15%, respectively.This model study shows that spinal irradiation of young children with photon and electron techniques results in a substantial risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers. Multiple beam IMXT seems to be associated with a particularly high risk of secondary cancer induction. To minimise this risk, IMPT should be the treatment of choice. If proton therapy is not available, advanced electron therapy may provide a better alternative

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pertinent radiological and biochemical literature was searched and retrieved via electronic media (medline, pubmed. Basic concepts of MRS of the prostate and its clinical applications were extracted. RESULTS: Clinical MRS is usually based on point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) or spin echo (SE) sequences, along with outer volume suppression of signals from outside of the prostate. MRS of the prostate detects indicator lines of citrate, choline, and creatine. While healthy prostate tissue demonstrates high levels of citrate and low levels of choline that marks cell wall turnover, prostate cancer utilizes citrate for energy metabolism and shows high levels of choline. The ratio of (choline+creatine)/citrate distinguishes between healthy tissue and prostate cancer. Particularly when combined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, three-dimensional MRS imaging (3D-CSI, or 3D-MRSI) detects and localizes prostate cancer in the entire prostate with high sensitivity and specificity. Combined MR imaging and 3D-MRSI exceed the sensitivity and specificity of sextant biopsy of the prostate. When MRS and MR imaging agree on prostate cancer presence, the positive predictive value is about 80-90%. Distinction between healthy tissue and prostate cancer principally is maintained after various therapeutic treatments, including hormone ablation therapy, radiation therapy, and cryotherapy of the prostate. CONCLUSIONS: Since it is non-invasive, reliable, radiation-free, and essentially repeatable, combined MR imaging and 3D-MRSI of the prostate lends itself to the planning of biopsy and therapy, and to post-therapeutic follow-up. For broad clinical acceptance, it will be necessary to facilitate MRS examinations and their evaluation and make MRS available to a wider range of institutions. [References: 57]

Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHODS: MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a "spreading wavefront" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy

Currently published studies use IMRT only in the treatment of the primary tumor. In these studies, the lymph nodes of the neck were treated using conventional techniques. The feasibility of an IMRT technique which allows treatment of the complete target volume, including the primary tumor and lymph nodes, without a beam split is described. PATIENT AND METHOD: For inverse treatment planning, the KonRad planning system was used. The primary as well as the secondary PTV (bilateral lymph node levels) were treated with one intensity-modulated primary plan. To increase the dose in the primary PTV and suspicious lymph nodes, an intensity-modulated boost plan was performed. The "step and shoot" IMRT technique was used. A plan comparison between the described IMRT approach and an IMRT approach using a split-beam technique was performed focusing on the treatment time. A patient with a carcinoma of the nasopharynx was treated with curative intent by a combined radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: The median total dose to the primary PTV was 70 Gy, to suspicious lymph nodes > or = 66.0 Gy, and to the secondary PTV 52 Gy. The defined maximum doses to the organs at risk were not exceeded, and the median dose to the protected parotid gland amounted to 21 Gy. Comparison of the treatment time between both IMRT approaches revealed only a slightly shorter treatment time (1-3 min) for the split-beam IMRT technique without considering the remaining conventional treatment parts of the split-beam IMRT technique. The patient achieved a complete response, and 18 months after treatment no signs of recurrent disease are visible. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT allows the treatment of the target volumes with high doses combined with an excellent sparing of the organs at risk. The IMRT approach presented here makes the treatment of the whole target volume with a single-beam arrangement feasible and does not increase the treatment time compared to a split-beam IMRT technique. Treatment time was comparable to a conventional three-field technique combined with electrons. This IMRT technique can prevent over- or underdosage at field matchlines in the head and neck region and, moreover, is able to spare parotid glands and therefore better avoid xerostomia compared to conventional techniques

In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT

This paper will discuss proton treatment in general, treatment planning procedures, and results to date in major patient categories. 846 patients have been treated with fractionated proton therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron, with normal tissue and tumor responses consistent with an RBE of 1.1 for the proton beam. Proton beam therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with uveal melanomas, and chordomas and chondrosarcomas involving the skull base and cervical spine. Improved dose distribution possible with protons have allowed greater doses than are given conventionally to be delivered to patients with prostatic carcinoma, head and neck malignancies, ano-rectal cancers, and retroperitoneal tumors. Doses employed have been usually 10 to 20% greater than normally would be delivered in our department to such tumors. Generally, local control rates have been good	
1	3649	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: probability of eye retention after proton treatment	Actuarial Analysis, Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immunotherapy, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Risk, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Enucleation was performed after proton treatment in 57 of 1006 (5.7%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986. Only 2% of 99 patients with small tumors and 4% of 566 patients with intermediate size tumors underwent enucleation after treatment; 10% of 341 patients with large tumors lost the treated eye. No eyes were removed after 52 months, with 89% of enucleations performed during the first 36 months after treatment. Eye retention rates at 60 months were 89.1 +/- 3.0% for the entire group, and 97 +/- 3.7%, 92.7 +/- 3.1%, and 78.3 +/- 7.0% in patients with small, intermediate, and large tumors, respectively. Significantly greater enucleation rates were observed in patients with large tumors than in those with intermediate tumors (p = less than .0001), in patients with tumor height greater than 8 mm relative to those with tumors less than or equal to 8 mm, p = (less than .0001), with tumor diameter greater than 16 mm compared to less than or equal to 16 mm, (p = less than .0001), and with tumor involvement of the ciliary body compared to involvement of the choroid only (p = less than .0001). Possible strategies to decrease the likelihood of enucleation in patients at apparently increased risk of losing the eye after conservative therapy, that is, those with large tumors involving the ciliary body, might include a lower total dose, a more protracted treatment course, or a lower radiation dose and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with hyperthermia, or with other radiation sensitizers	
1	3650	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: local recurrence after proton beam therapy	Adult, Boston, Cobalt, Eye, Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty-three of 1006 (2.3%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986 received additional treatment for documented (15 patients) or suspected (eight patients) tumor growth in the irradiated eye. Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

For skull base tumors, 10-year local control rates with combined proton-photon therapy are highest for chondrosarcomas, intermediate for male chordomas, and lowest for female chordomas (94%, 65%, and 42%, respectively). For cervical spine tumors, 10-year local control rates are not significantly different for chordomas and chondrosarcomas (54% and 48%, respectively), nor is there any difference in local control between males and females. Observed treatment-related morbidity has been judged acceptable, in view of the major morbidity and mortality which accompany uncontrolled tumor growth. [References: 46]	
1	1746	Uveal melanomas. Conservation treatment. [Review] [67 refs]	Boston, Brachytherapy, Breast, Helium, Humans, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Probability, Prostate, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Risk, Survival, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision	Eye conservation can be achieved in patients with uveal melanomas by several techniques, with external beam charged particle (proton) therapy and episcleral radionuclide plaque therapy being used most commonly. The probability of visual preservation and of eye retention with either technique is related to tumor size and location. If vision is poor or absent in the fellow eye, even very large tumors can be treated with the proton beam, with a 75% to 80% probability of eye salvage and preservation of some degree of visual function. Local control is achieved in a large proportion of treated eyes with either technique probably because of the large doses that can be focally administered to these relatively small tumors with those techniques. Achieving local control may also contribute to improved survival in some patients. Survival clearly has not been compromised. Useful vision is preserved in eyes with tumors occurring in a favorable location with respect to the optic disc or macula. A dose-searching trial, aimed at improving visual outcome in patients with tumors in unfavorable locations, has been completed and has provided data to aid in designing future trials. Successfully treating uveal melanoma without removal of the involved eye is one of the major oncologic triumphs of the latter part of the 20th century. Very high rates of local control can be achieved with heavy charged particle external beam radiotherapy or 125I episcleral plaque brachytherapy, with preservation of a functionally useful eye in many patients. The excellent results in the eye melanoma patients treated with external beam proton therapy also demonstrate that almost all the patients can successfully cooperate in their treatment by voluntarily fixating the eye on a particular point during treatment, so that their tumor is positioned properly in the beam during treatment. Conservative treatment can achieve local control rates similar to or superior to those achieved with radiation therapy alone in other commonly treated solid tumors, including early stage carcinomas of the breast, vocal cord, and prostate. Continued careful follow-up of conservatively treated patients will provide even better understanding of the radiation effects on uveal melanomas and on normal ocular structures. It is also impressive that these gains have not been achieved at a cost of increased mortality: survival rates in irradiated patients are at least as good as after enucleation. Further observation will reveal whether these initial dramatic and encouraging results will be maintained. The COMS Study may provide additional data in this regard at least regarding survival after brachytherapy relative to enucleation. It will not, however, clarify indications for the two types of radiotherapy (brachytherapy and charged particle therapy) nor will it allow direct comparisons of acute and chronic ocular effects of those therapeutic modalities. The UCSF-LBL trial mentioned previously, which compared helium ion therapy with 125I episcleral plaque treatment, has documented the superiority of charged particle therapy to plaque therapy in terms of local tumor control and eye retention. Of interest is a recent survey reporting that choice of treatment for uveal melanoma did not seem to be associated with large differences in quality of life when assessed at long-term follow-up. The distant failures and metastatic deaths in uveal melanoma patients, more common with larger and more anteriorly located tumors, are most distressing. A randomized clinical trial of adjuvant systemic therapy is clearly indicated but has not been mounted because of the relatively poor results obtained with systemic therapy in metastatic melanoma patients. The recent report of improved survival in cutaneous melanoma patients at high risk for metastasis who were treated with interferon is encouraging, and it led to the initiation of the nonrandomized study described previously, which uses interferon following proton eye irradiation for patients with increased risk of metastasis. Other trials would clearly be indicated if more effective systemic therapies become available. [References: 67]

[Japanese]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cancer Care Facilities, Carbon, Female, Head, Humans, Japan, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostate, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Safety, Treatment Outcome	The Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center(HIBMC) is a hospital-based charged particle treatment facility. Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 125 patients who underwent proton therapy between July 2003 and December 2004. Of these 125 patients, 11 had head and neck malignancies, 15 non-small cell lung cancers, 22 hepatocellular carcinomas, 62 prostate cancers, and 15 other malignant tumors. RESULTS: Most patients experienced Grade 0-1 acute morbidities (NCI-CTC) in skin or mucosa, while a temporary Grade 2-3 reaction was observed in a high dose area. Response rates were 73% for H & N malignancies, 100% for NSCLC, and 77% for HCC. PSA evaluation for patients with prostate cancer revealed a high rate of complete response. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of proton therapy at Shizuoka Cancer Center was demonstrated for patients with early-stage cancer or locally advanced disease

Because the procedure is performed without a rigid frame, the precision of dose alignment can be affected by patient movement. Movement is limited by noninvasive restraints and compensated by remeasuring the target position at short intervals throughout treatment and then realigning the beam. Frameless image-guided radiosurgery has been used at our institution to treat 250 cranial, 23 spinal, 9 lung, and 3 pancreas cases involving malignant and benign tumors as well as vascular malformations. We have analyzed the target position records for all of these cases to assess the frequency, magnitude, and case-by-case patterns of patient movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The position of the treatment site during image-guided radiosurgery was measured at approximately 1-2-min intervals, on average, using orthogonal amorphous silicon X-ray cameras and an image registration process that determined all six degrees of freedom in the target's position. The change in position from one measurement to the next was indicative of patient movement. RESULTS: The treatment site position along each axis of translation was observed to vary by an average of 0.45 mm for the cranium, 0.53 mm for the cervical spine, 0.53 mm for the lumbar and thoracic spine, 1.06 mm for the lung, and 1.50 mm for the pancreas. Half of all cranial cases showed systematic drifting of the target away from the initial setup position. CONCLUSION: Using noninvasive restraints and supports, short-term movement of the head and spine during image-guided radiosurgery was limited to a radius of 0.8 mm, which satisfies the prevailing standard for radiosurgical dose alignment precision, but maintaining this margin of error throughout a treatment fraction requires regular monitoring of the target site's position

Hence, an improved clinical benefit is to be expected predominantly in large, hypoxic and slowly growing tumors. Since a short course of radiotherapy is required for clinical reasons, it prompted the authors to initiate a randomly controlled trial on locally advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 1999, 27 patients with locally advanced breast cancer were irradiated with photons (60 Gy, 30 fractions; 8 MV, (60)Co) or neutrons (18 Gy, twelve fractions; 66 MeV(p-->Be)). The mean tumor diameters were 699 +/- 399 ml for the photon group and 1,097 +/- 831 ml in the neutron group. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 21.5 months tumor involution was evaluated in 22 patients. Partial and complete remissions were registered in 6/10 patients of the photon group and 5/12 patients of the neutron group. Late grade 3-4 morbidity according to RTOG definition was scored in 5/10 patients in the photon group and in 6/12 patients in the neutron group. With regard to tumor control and late radiation morbidity no differences between the two treatment arms were observed. CONCLUSION: The underlying data indicate that no benefit is to be expected from neutron therapy in breast cancer

The performance of the unit and different variants of dosimetric therapeutic plans of the fast electron beam are presented. Electron therapy with the energy of 6 MeV was mostly used in patients with head and neck tumors. Intra-oral irradiation with fast electrons was given to 4 patients with cancer of the moving part of the tongue and 5 patients with cancer of the fundic oral mucosa, the soft palate and the buccal mucosa in the form of combined or concomitant therapy. Summary focal doses in irradiation with fast electrons were 45-63 Gy for a combined or radical therapeutic course. A noticeable tumor regression was observed in patients with cancer of the skin, vermilion border and breast cancer recurrences. Though there were very few cases the results of concomitant and combined radiotherapy of cancer of the oral mucosa were promising. The first results of clinical application of the small-size PMB-6E betatron have shown its high efficacy for the treatment of superficial tumors

For design of courses of neutron and combined neutron-photon therapy formulas of DMF calculation were used in cases of homogeneous and arrhythmic dose fractionation. The authors presented some data on methods of therapy with fast neutrons, dose fractionation schedules, a focal dose value, and time of treatment. Complete tumor regression was noted in 50-54% of cases using fast neutrons alone or in combination with photon radiation. A high sensitivity to neutron radiation of nonepidermoid carcinomas as compared to epidermoid cancer types was established with relation to tumor morphological structure

An electron beam with the energy of 7 MeV was produced on the small-size betatron, irradiation fields were formed, and absorbed dose distribution was studied. The efficacy of the use of the beam in 110 patients with superficial malignant tumors was analyzed. The use of electron beam radiation was found promising for therapy of patients with locally spread types of skin and lower lip cancers and breast cancer local recurrences. Complete tumor regression was noted in 75-90% of the patients. Intraoral cone electron therapy combined with 60Co-therapy of surgery was employed for early cancer of the oral cavity

The reaction of tumor and of normal tissue was studied in dependence on different physical and biological factors. Two variants of neutron therapy planning were estimated by means of mathematical models of a factor of time-dose-fractionation for neutron (TDFN) from clinical point of view. Results of changes in oxygen-tension within the tumor are represented in 20 patients with metastases in cervical lymph-nodes during neutron therapy. The obtained data show a correlation of regression and reoxygenation rate of the tumor to its initial volume. The reaction of the tumor in therapy with fast neutrons was studied in dependence on its morphological structure. Complete regression of epidermoid and nonepidermoid cancer types was seen in 42 or 89% of the cases. With corrections for adipose tissue and the extent of dose fraction of fast neutrons the clinical test of the mathematical model of TDFN-factor made discernible that the reaction of normal tissue can be prognosticated quite exactly by means of this model in neutron therapy	
1	65	Whole-body dose from tomotherapy delivery	Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Dosage, Scattering,Radiation, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Whole-Body Counting	PURPOSE: To measure whole-body dose in tomotherapy of the head and neck region resulting from internal patient scatter and linear accelerator leakage. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatments are performed using a commercial computer-controlled intensity modulated radiation therapy planning and delivery system (Peacock, NOMOS Corp.) and a 6-MV linear accelerator (Clinac 6/100, Varian Corp.). The patient dose outside the treatment field is measured in a water-equivalent phantom using thermoluminescent dosimetry. The whole-body dose components from internal scatter and leakage are separately determined. The use of fixed-portal leakage and scattered radiation measurements to estimate the whole-body dose from tomotherapy is evaluated. RESULTS: The internally scattered dose is significant near the target, but becomes negligible relative to the leakage dose beyond 15 cm from the target. Dose at 10 cm from the target volume, due to internal scatter and leakage, is approximately 2.5% of the total target dose, reducing to 0.5% at 30 cm. The measured dose is relatively uniform throughout the phantom. CONCLUSION: The whole-body dose equivalent from a tomotherapy treatment is greater than that from conventional radiation therapy. Further studies are required to assess the trade-off between improved dose distribution conformality and a possible slight increase in radiation-induced fatal malignancies. The accuracy of using fixed-portal leakage and scattered dose measurements to estimate the whole-body dose from tomotherapy treatments is adequate, if the appropriate fixed-portal field size equivalent is used

Target volumes are irradiated using sequential 1.68-cm-thick slices with the patient moved between each successive slice delivery. Due to the method of delivery, superficial doses from a course of intensity modulated radiation therapy may be significantly different from doses delivered with conventional radiation therapy. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the superficial depth-dose distribution for geometric target volumes. Treatment plans were conducted for 5-cm-diam, 5-cm-long right cylindrical target volumes embedded in a 16-cm-diam, 12-cm-long water-equivalent cylindrical phantom. Three experiments were conducted with centrally located, off-centered, and superficial targets. Doses at superficial depths were measured using 3 x 3 x 1 mm3 thermoluminescent dosimetry chips. For all three targets, the measured doses were slightly greater than the calculated doses. Doses measured in the buildup region for the superficial target indicated that bolus would be required to provide the prescribed dose at the phantom surface

A five year follow-up of patients treated in Uppsala, Sweden	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty patients with malignant uveal melanoma were treated at the The Svedbergh cyclotron in Uppsala from 1989 to 1991. Each tumour received a total dose of 54.6 Gy in four equal fractions on four following days. After treatment the melanoma in all eyes showed decrease in size combined with irradiation retinopathy. In eight patients the treatment was successful after five years. Nine eyes had to be enucleated, two due to recurrence and seven due to neovascular glaucoma. Three patients died, two from metastases and one from heart disease. In all patients the visual acuity was dependent on the distance between the irradiation field and the macula or optic nerve. Each patient suffered from transient post irradiation skin erythema and permanent loss of eyelashes and eyebrows when these were included in the irradiation field. The development of secondary glaucoma was positively correlated with tumour volume, but not to the age or sex of the patients. Histological examination of all the enucleated eyes revealed residual viable tumour without obvious radiation damage: mitotic figures were not identified. MRI examination, performed before and after treatment, demonstrated a marked shift in water binding properties after irradiation. The final visual acuity was dependent on the location of the tumour

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1984 to 1995, 38 consecutive cases with intracranial glioblastoma multiforme were treated using the rotational MLC conformal therapy. There were 25 men and 13 women with a median age of 47 years (12-73 years, mean 46.5 years). Median Karnofsky performance score was 80 (30-100, mean 78.2). Median tumor volume was 64 cc (8-800 cc, mean 110.3 cc). All underwent surgical intervention (only biopsy in 1, partial resection in 13, subtotal resection in 21, and gross total resection in 3). Radiation dose to was 60 to 80 Gy (median 68.5 Gy, mean 68.3 Gy) in 21 patients treated before 1990 and 90 Gy in the 17 patients thereafter. Biweekly i.v. chemotherapy was also administered for both arms. RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival rates were 75%, 42%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed the initial tumor volume, residual tumor volume, and Karnofsky performance score were statistically significant factors for survival. Only the residual tumor volume was statistically significant by multivariate analysis. The 5-year survival rate of patients with residual tumors of 5 cc or less in volume was as good as 37%. Survival of the 90-Gy Group appeared inferior to that of the Low-Dose Group, though no statistical difference was seen (the 3-year survival was 40% vs. 22%). Local failure was observed in 16 of the 19 recurrences in the Low-Dose Group, whereas it was observed in only 4 of the 13 recurrences in the 90-Gy Group. The difference in pattern of failure was statistically significant. Two patients of the High-Dose Group developed radiation necrosis and one died of it. CONCLUSIONS: The high-dose conformal radiotherapy did not improve survival in the disease, but did change the pattern of failure

The CBCT projection data of a phantom were acquired during rotational megavoltage (MV) dose delivery up to 6 Gy to evaluate image quality under MV beam irradiation. A lung tumor patient was treated with a total dose of 48 Gy in four fractions, each fraction including seven coplanar and noncoplanar beams, as well as a full-angle rotational beam. Tumor registration was performed between a planning CT image and a CBCT image immediately after patient setup. The patient couch was adjusted according to the registration results, and then the registration was repeated three times: immediately before treatment, during treatment, and immediately after treatment. The phantom image quality of the kV CBCT was not visually degraded up to the rotational MV dose of 6 Gy. Tumor position during rotational dose delivery was verified for the first time using kV CBCT

To design a new protocol that employs epithermal neutron beams in the treatment of glioma patients, we examined the relationship between the radiation dose, histological tumor grade, and clinical outcome. Since 1968, 183 patients with different kinds of brain tumors were treated by BNCT; for this retrospective study, we selected 105 patients with glial tumors who were treated in Japan between 1978 and 1997. In the analysis of side effects due to radiation, we included all the 159 patients treated between 1977 and 2001. With respect to the radiation dose (i.e. physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction), the new protocol prescribes a minimum tumor volume dose of 15 Gy or, alternatively, a minimum target volume dose of 18 Gy. The maximum vascular dose should not exceed 15 Gy (physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction) and the total amount of gamma rays should remain below 10 Gy, including core gamma rays from the reactor and capture gamma in brain tissue. The outcomes for 10 patients who were treated by the new protocol using a new mode composed of thermal and epithermal neutrons are reported

We presented performed 1H-MRS using the stimulated echo acquisition method (STEAM) for non-tumor sites in 2 patients who received radiation therapy for their brain tumors. In the first case up to 45 days after radiation, we could observe a normal spectra presented three major peaks of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline (Cho). In the second case who had radiation necrosis 1 year after radiation, the spectra showed a decrease in the all peaks beneath the noise level

The main purpose was to determine clinically useful fraction doses without severe acute reaction of normal tissues and to assess tumor control dose levels achievable without significant normal tissue toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment was given with four fixed fractions per week (24 fractions over 6 weeks) and was initiated with a fraction dose of 2.2 Gray equivalent (GyE), and the dose was increased as 2.4 GyE, 2.6 GyE, 2.8 GyE, and 3.0 GyE. Consequently, the total dose initiated was 52.8 GyE, to increase up to 72.0 GyE in 4.8-GyE increments in the dose-escalation fashion. Thirty patients with eligible advanced cervical cancers consisting of 27 squamous cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas were analyzed. RESULTS: Acute response of normal tissues was less than with photon treatment until fraction doses of 2.8 GyE were administered, and patients finished treatment with comfortable conditions. Severe late complications occurred in the two patients who received more than 67.2 GyE. The 2-year cumulative survival rate and the local control rate of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were 61.5% and 59.3%, respectively. According to stages, the 2-year survival rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 54.4% and 75.0%, respectively. The 2-year local control rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 52.6% and 75.0%, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results indicated that the disease control seems to be relatively better for very advanced disease and with dose escalation treatment. Local control was not significantly correlated with total dose and tumor volume. The results of the present study, despite small numbers and short observation, suggest that an adequate fraction dose for pelvis fields is 2.8 to 3.0 GyE and that the carbon beam therapy might be advantageous for advanced cervical cancer

However, no proof of this effect has been provided by clinical trials and related clinical research. Hence, we investigated the radiation biological aspects of high LET carbon beam therapy on cervical cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study involved 49 patients with stage IIIb bulky and stage IVa cervical cancer treated with high LET carbon beams between October 1995 and June 2000. Oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) was measured by using a needle-type polarographic oxygen electrode. RESULTS: The 4-year disease-free survival rates of patients with pO(2) </= 20 mm Hg (hypoxic tumor) and pO(2) > 20 mm Hg (oxygenated tumor) before treatment were 37% and 21%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before treatment were 58% and 54%, respectively. The disease-free survival rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors assessed by oxygen status at the 5th day of irradiation were 33% and 32%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors at the 5th day were 60% and 58%, respectively. There was no significant prognostic difference between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors. CONCLUSION: The similar disease-free survival and local control rates between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before and during treatment indicated that the role of the tumor oxygenation status was not so important in local control in carbon beam therapy. These results indicated that high LET carbon beam irradiation might reduce the radiation-resistant nature stemming from tumor hypoxia

STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight teeth in 12 patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) EF group: 40 teeth were only treated by fluoride gel (application for 5 minutes followed by 1 minute rinsing with distilled water). (2) EFL group: 40 teeth were treated the same way as in the EF group but they were lased after fluoridation. (3) E group of 18 teeth were kept without any treatment and considered as reference. In order to quantify the fluoride content in the enamel samples, the teeth were analyzed by proton beam delivered by a tandem accelerator (PIgammaE, particle induced gamma-ray emission). The fluoride content of enamel surface is not homogeneous. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the same enamel area after each treatment. Each tooth was maintained in a fixed tooth holder which was designed to analyze the tooth enamel surface at the same place (1 mm(2) and around 20 mum in depth) after various treatments. A low energy density of argon laser beam was used: 10.74 J/cm(2), 30 seconds of irradiation time and 340 m W of output power. RESULTS: The results after 7 days showed that the lased enamel still retained 157.4 +/- 23.371 ppm or 42.29% of fluoride after fluoridation process whereas the unlased enamel retained 45.59 +/- 9.377 ppm or 12.25% of fluoride. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the use of argon laser at low energy density (10.74 J/cm(2)) significantly increases the fluoride retention in lased enamel which had approximately three times more fluoride than the unlased enamel.

STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight teeth in 12 patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) EF group: 40 teeth were only treated with fluoride gel (applied for 5 minutes followed by a 1 minute rinsing with distilled water). (2) EFL group: 40 teeth were treated the same way as in the EF group but they were lased after fluoridation. (3) E group: 18 teeth were kept without any treatment as a control group. In order to quantify the fluoride content in the enamel samples, the teeth were analyzed by proton beam delivered by a tandem accelerator (PIgE, particle induced gamma-ray emission). A low energy density of argon laser beam was used: 10.74 J/cm2 (11 mm of beam diameter, irradiation time of 30 seconds, and an output power of 340 mW in continuous mode). RESULTS: The results after 6 months showed that the lased enamel still retained 52.55+/-8.47 ppm or 14.12% of fluoride after the fluoridation process, whereas the unlased enamel retained only 12.18+/-6.82 ppm or 3.27% of fluoride. The untreated and control enamel (E group: unlased and without fluoride treatment) had 1.16+/-4.27 ppm value of fluoride. The statistical test (ANOVA tests at 95% level) showed that the difference is significant between the fluoride retention in the group EFL and the group EF 6 months after fluoridation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of argon laser at low energy density (10.74 J/cm2) significantly increased the fluoride retention in lased enamel that had approximately 400 times more fluoride than the unlased enamel. We consider this procedure as an alternative clinical procedure to increase the fluoride content of enamel surface. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc

We treated nine AVM, 12 metastatic brain tumors, two malignant lymphomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, two meningiomas, and one brain tumor of unknown pathology. In the follow-up examinations at least five months after treatment, the local control rate was 83% for the metastatic tumors, and two malignant lymphomas disappeared completely. In addition, satisfactory results have been obtained with AVM and other brain tumors without any side effects. In comparison with gamma-knife radiosurgery, linac radiosurgery has some disadvantages such as longer treatment time and cumbersome accuracy control, but if accuracy control is performed periodically, accuracies of 1 mm or less can be obtained. There is some strengths of linac radiosurgery as follow. 1) The acquisition cost is relatively low. 2) Dose distribution are equivalent to gamma-knife. 3) There is no field size limitation. 4) There is great flexibility in beam delivery and linac systems. Radiosurgery using linear accelerators seems to become widely accepted in the future

The purposes of this study is to review results of RS for these large cerebral arteriovenous malformations and to study recent methods which can allow to improve results. PATIENTS: and method. From our series, 112 patients had cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 30 mm or 10 cc at time of the radiosurgery. Revelation mode was hemorrhage in 47%, seizures in 42%, headaches in 16%, and progressive neurological deficits in 7%. Discovery was fortuitous in 2.7% of cases. Before radiosurgery, 57% were embolized, 5% were operated, 4.5% were reirradiated and 1.8% were operated and embolized. Distribution according to Spetzler & Martin's grade was following: 0% in grade I, 12% in grade II, 41% in grade III and 46% in grade IV. No patient was in grade V. RESULTS: Global obliteration rate was 39% for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations. In multivariate analysis, only recovering (positive correlation), and previous embolization (negative correlation) were correlated with obliteration rate. CONCLUSION: Current procedures of radiosurgery allow obliteration in a limited number of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated. Other strategies as fractioned irradiation, multileaf microcollimators with single isocenter, radiosurgery before surgery or radiosurgery with protons should improve obliteration rate.

PATIENTS: and method. From January 1984 to December 1998, 705 patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, radiophysicians and radiotherapists. Age of revelation of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations ranged between birth to 73 years (mean 27, median 25). Age at time of radiosurgery ranged between 7 and 75 years (mean 33, median 31). There were 410 males for 295 females (sex- ratio 1.4). Symptoms of revelation were hemorrhage for 59%, seizures for 23%, headaches for 14% and progressive deficits for 4%. Discovery of cerebral arteriovenous malformation was fortuitous in 4% of cases. Repartition following Spetzler's grading was 12% in grade I, 36% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 12% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. Maximal size ranged between 4 and 60 mm (mean 23, median 20). Volume ranged between 0.2 and 24.3 cc (mean 3.8, median 2.8). Majority of cerebral arteriovenous malformations were large size (42% with size higher than 25 mm) and large volume (54% higher than 10 cc. 54% of patients had treatment prior radiosurgery: 38% had embolization, 10% were operated, 4% were treated by radiosurgery (reirradiation) and 3% were operated and embolized. RESULTS: Overall complete obliteration rate was 55%. The obliteration rate was correlated with size (77% for cAVMs lower than 15 mm, 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations between 15 and 25 mm, and 44% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 25 mm), with volume (94% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations lower than 1 cc, 64% between 1 and 4 cc, 48% between 4 and 10 cc, and 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 10 cc), dose at reference isodose, minimal dose, morphological parameters (presence of dural components, arteriolovenous fistula, plexiform angioarchitecture, arterial steal, arterial recruitment, deep exclusive drainage, venous plicature, venous confluence, venous ectasia, venous reflux), sectional topography and good recovery of the target. Embolization was a confusion factor not associated with obliteration rate. After multivariate analysis, only Dmin and complete coverage of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations were correlated with obliteration rate. Delay of obliteration was significantly correlated after multivariate analysis with Dmin, complete coverage, arteriolovenulary angioarchitecture (positive correlation) and venous ectasia (negative correlation). CONCLUSION: Overall complete obliteration rate is unreliable data to assess efficacy of radiosurgical method in the tretment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The obliteration rate must be interpretated after stratification on several morphological and dosimetric parameters

In order to improve outcomes, we sought to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of sstr-targeted high-LET alpha-emitting (213)Bi to that of low-LET beta(-)-emitting (177)Lu by determining relative biological effectiveness (RBE) using the external gamma-beam of (137)Cs as reference radiation. METHODS: Sstr-expressing human pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-2 cells and A549 control cells were used for this study. The effects of different radiation doses of (213)Bi and (177)Lu labeled to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid and sstr-targeted DOTATOC were investigated with a clonogenic cell survival assay. Apoptosis was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISA(PLUS) 10x kit. RESULTS: Using equimolar DOTATOC treatment with concurrent irradiation with a (137)Cs source as reference radiation, the calculated RBE of [(213)Bi]DOTATOC was 3.4, as compared to 1.0 for [(177)Lu]DOTATOC. As measured in terms of absorbance units, [(213)Bi]DOTATOC caused a 2.3-fold-greater release of apoptosis-specific mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes than [(177)Lu]DOTATOC at the final treatment time of 96 h (P<.001) in sstr-expressing Capan-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, at the same absorbed dose, [(213)Bi]DOTATOC is therapeutically more effective in decreasing survival than is [(177)Lu]DOTATOC in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells due to its comparatively higher RBE

Patients were followed until death or 1/1/90. The median follow-up was 8 months (2-43 months). Fourteen patients experienced complications from 12 hours to 7 months (median 3 months, but only two patients more than 4 months) following radiosurgery. To determine variables related to complication, we calculated integral dose-volume histograms for 61/64 lesions and the surrounding CT-defined normal tissue. We excluded 16 lesions in 15 patients for follow-up less than 4 months (12 patients) or insufficient treatment information (3 patients). The variables for which higher values were associated with significantly more toxicity in a univariate score test were: a) tumor dose inhomogeneity (p less than 0.00001), b) maximum tumor dose (p = 0.00002), c) number of isocenters (p = 0.00002), d) maximum normal tissue dose (p = 0.00005) and e) tumor volume (p = 0.0001). These variables were all highly correlated with tumor dose inhomogeneity (coefficients of rank correlation 0.75-0.81). Tumor dose inhomogeneity had a much higher loglikelihood in a logistic model than any other single variable and a higher loglikelihood than any other two variables combined. None of the 21 patients with metastatic lesions experienced a complication. When we excluded the metastatic lesions, the above five variables remained significant in univariate tests. The mean tumor dose, number of treatment arcs, total degrees of arc, tumor location, previous radiotherapy, tumor geometry, pretreatment performance status, collimator size, and age were not significantly associated with toxicity. We conclude that radiosurgery of intracranial tumors is associated with a low risk of complications for lesions less than 10cc treated with a single isocenter to maximum tumor doses less than 25 Gy with tumor dose inhomogeneity less than 10 Gy, but that treatment of larger lesions will require new treatment strategies which reduce the tumor dose inhomogeneity associated with multiple isocenter treatments

Survival rates, patterns of failure and prognostic factors were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients with follicle centre lymphoma stage I and II were treated between 1970 and 1999 in Dresden. Therapy modalities were radiotherapy alone (103 patients) or combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (13 patients). Radiotherapy was applied as involved-field-(IFI)- (104 patients), extended-field- (nine patients) or total-nodal- (three patients) irradiation. Patients received doses between 25 Gy and 50 Gy (median 35 Gy). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were 76% and 51%. Relapse free survival was 62% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up was 4,0 years. Relapses after complete remission were registered in 44 cases. Six patients have had in-field-recurrences. The majority of out-field-recurrences were nodal relapses (50%). 11% of relapses occurred outside of lymph nodes or were disseminated failures (18%). Significant favorable prognostic factors identified by multivariate and univariate analysis were low age (age < 50 years vs. age > 50 years), low stage and performance of bipedal lymphangiography as primary staging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is an effective and tolerable treatment modality for follicle centre lymphoma in the early stages I and II. We registered a high proportion of nodal recurrences, which may be minimized by prophylactic extended radiotherapy	
0	3683	MR and CT of occult vascular malformations of the brain	Adult, Angiography, Brain, Cerebral Angiography/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Subtraction Technique, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	The need for improved specificity in the diagnosis of "occult" vascular malformations led to the use of MR in suspected cases in order to determine MR's potential for improved diagnostic accuracy. Six patients with six lesions histologically diagnosed as vascular malformation after partial (1) or complete (5) microsurgical excision were studied by CT, MR, and selective magnification subtraction angiography. In all cases, the cerebral lesions were apparently solitary and were visible as focal lesions on both CT and MR. Since angiography failed to reveal the pathologic blood vessels of the lesions, and no arteriovenous shunting was evident, these lesions were termed vascular malformations occult to angiography (VMOTA). Angiography revealed a mass effect in only two cases. MR did not reveal additional vascular malformations missed by CT. In each case, MR, which was performed in an attempt to support the diagnosis suggested by CT, did in fact do so by revealing signal abnormalities indicative of nonacute hemorrhage within the lesion on T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences. Although, as on CT, MR features of these lesions were found to be nonspecific, the MR criteria reinforced the probable diagnosis of VMOTA in an additional 30 cases that had shown similar nonspecific CT features. In this second group, excluded from this study, in which histologic verification was not obtained because of perceived hazards of surgery, the increased assurance regarding the diagnosis led to proton-beam therapy without histologic verification in 18 cases. It is concluded that MR can provide significant improvement in the accuracy of diagnosing VMOTA beyond that obtainable just by plain and contrast-enhanced CT

The absorbed dose standard for ocular proton therapy beams at HCL was based on a fluence measurement with a Faraday cup (FC). A majority of proton therapy centers worldwide, however, use an absorbed dose standard that is based on an ionization chamber (IC) technique. The ion chamber calibration is deduced from a measurement in a reference 60Co photon field together with a calculated correction factor that takes into account differences in a chamber's response in 60Co and proton fields. In this work, we implemented an ionization chamber-based absolute dosimetry system for the HCL ocular beamline based on the recommendations given in Report 59 by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements. Comparative measurements revealed that the FC system yields an absorbed dose to water value that is 1.1% higher than was obtained with the IC system. That difference is small compared with the experimental uncertainties and is clinically insignificant. In June of 1998, we adopted the IC-based method as our standard practice for the ocular beam	
0	1601	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cerebral glioma after irradiation	Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/me [Metabolism], Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Glioma/me [Metabolism], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Research	BACKGROUND: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly employed to assess cerebral gliomas after radiotherapy, but it cannot always differentiate tumor regrowth from post-irradiation changes. In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to evaluate changes in cerebral metabolites in patients with a cerebral glioma after irradiation. METHODS: Over a period of 3 years, we performed MRS after MRI whenever soft tissue masses were found on magnetic resonance (MR) images. A total of 122 MR spectra of 58 patients was used for analysis. Spectral interpretations were based on integral values of the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho) compounds relative to phosphocreatine/creatine (Cr). RESULTS: Our MRS study showed that higher Cho/Cr ratios occurred in regrowing gliomas than for stable diseases (range, 0.9 to 9.5 vs. 0.4 to 2.1; mean, 3.0 vs. 1.2). A greater increment in the Cho/Cr ratio between successive studies was also noted in regrowing gliomas than for stable disease (range, 41% to 87% vs. < 32%). No significant differences in NAA/Cr ratios or lactate were found between these 2 groups. None of our patients exhibited abnormal MR spectra in the mirror area of the contralateral brain. CONCLUSION: MRS provides valuable information about the metabolism of irradiated gliomas and can be used to exclude radiation encephalopathy of the contralateral brain. Cho is the most reliable indicator of a regrowing glioma. A high Cho/Cr ratio or substantial elevation in the Cho/Cr ratio between serial studies increases the likelihood of tumor regrowth. However, lower Cho/Cr ratios were inconclusive for determining if tumor regrowth or a stable process was occurring	
1	14	Ciliary body melanoma masquerading as chronic uveitis	Cataract Extraction, Chronic Disease, Ciliary Body/pa [Pathology], Ciliary Body/us [Ultrasonography], Diagnosis,Differential, Humans, Intraocular Pressure, Lens Implantation,Intraocular, Male, Melanoma/di [Diagnosis], Middle Aged, Reoperation, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveitis/di [Diagnosis], Vitrectomy	PURPOSE: To report a case of ciliary body melanoma that masqueraded as chronic uveitis. METHODS: A patient experienced persistent unilateral panuveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. Inflammation and pressure worsened after cataract extraction and lens implantation. Diagnostic vitrectomy was non-revealing. RESULTS: Repeat vitrectomy and lens implant removal revealed a ciliary body mass, suggestive of melanoma. Ultrasonography and clinical evaluation by the retinal oncologists supported this diagnosis. The uveitis persisted despite aggressive medical treatments, including methotrexate. Proton beam irradiation of the melanoma led to resolution of uveitis and restoration of normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Ciliary body melanoma can present as chronic uveitis and refractory glaucoma	
0	3688	Stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations in childhood	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebral Angiography, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Italy, Male, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies, Universities	BACKGROUND: The main techniques and results in stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of endocranial AVM's are described and compared. The authors also report their preliminary experience in the treatment of 6 consecutive pediatric patients with intracerebral vascular malformations using gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery. METHODS: The various stereotactic radiosurgery methods currently used (charged-particle beam, modified linear accelerator, and GK) are described. At the Department of Neurosurgery in Verona, from February 1993 to February 1996, stereotactic GK radiosurgery was performed on 721 patients, including 20 of pediatric age (3%). Of the 78 AVMs, 7 (9%) were diagnosed in children. One patient was lost at follow-up. Among the remaining 6 children, there were 3 males and 3 females with a mean age of 12.3 years (range, 5-16 years). Treatment general anesthesia was needed only in 1 case. The AVM volume was always less than 10 cc. After completion of the procedure, children were discharged from the hospital the following day. RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 29 months (median 18.8 months). The angiographic confirmed total obliteration is used as the end point of an AVM treated radiosurgically, and usually requires 2 to 3 years. All the patients are alive; four of the treated children are neurologically normal and one patient has clinically improved to a normal neurological status. The sixth patient has fixed neurological deficits that existed prior to treatment. Among the three cases with a follow-up period of over 2 years, complete obliteration has been angiographically confirmed in 2 patients and subtotal in 1 patient. In the three remaining patients with follow-up periods less than 2 years, serial MR images suggest subtotal obliteration in 2 cases and no significant change in one patient who had undergone treatment within the current year. To date, neither persistent GK radiosurgery-related complications nor bleeding following stereotactic radiosurgery has been described. CONCLUSIONS: The review of literature and our preliminary results suggest that also in children, as in adults, the use of stereotactically delivered irradiation represents a safe and effective technique obtaining complete obliteration of AVMs previously considered surgically inaccessible due to their location and poor response to resection and/or embolization

Parameters include the tissue dimensions, the 10B concentration and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factors for the different dose components associated with BNCT. Because there is still no worldwide agreement on RBE values, more often than not, average values for these parameters are used. It turns out that the RBE-problem can be circumvented by taking into account all imaginable parameter values. Approaching this quest from another angle: the outcome will also provide the parameters (and values) which influence the optimal source neutron energy. For brain tumours it turns out that the 10B concentration, the RBE factors for 10B as well as fast neutrons, together with the dose limit set for healthy tissue, affect the optimal BNCT source neutron energy. By using source neutrons of a few keV together with neutrons of a few eV, it ensures that, under all imaginable circumstances, a maximum of alpha (and lithium) particles can be delivered in the tumour

METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79% and 60%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted

However, it is difficult to evaluate its effect in certain cases. Recently, it has been reported that the usage of contrast-enhanced color Doppler ultrasonography (CECDU) can improve diagnostic accuracy, both in terms of the presence of hepatic tumor and in the evaluation of treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of CECDU in assessing the therapeutic response of HCC treated with proton radiotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-two patients treated with the proton radiotherapy were studied. We inspected HCC lesions by CECDU, before and after the irradiation, over time. The magnitude of blood flow in the HCC was quantified on still images by CECDU. The ratio of the number of color pixels against that of the total number of pixels in the tumor area was defined as the tumor blood flow ratio (TBFR). RESULTS: Immediately after the proton treatment, a transient increase of blood flow in the tumor was recognized in more than half of the patients, while the TBFR was unchanged or decreased in the remaining patients. At longer periods after irradiation, the TBFR in all HCCs gradually decreased, and this reduction of TBFR was statistically significant from 9 months after irradiation. These findings are consistent with those obtained previously by computed tomography (CT) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CONCLUSIONS: We propose CECDU as a useful diagnostic option for the evaluation of HCC treated with proton radiotherapy	
1	1141	Evaluation of therapeutic potential of heavy ion therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Feasibility Studies, Femur Head, Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Male, Motion, Movement, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of raster scanned heavy charged particle therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa,) with special regard to the influence of internal organ motion on the dose distribution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients

This synthesis of the literature is based on data from one meta-analysis, 30 randomized trials, many dealing with hormonal therapy, 55 prospective trials, and 210 retrospective studies. Totally the studies included 152,614 patients. There is a lack of properly controlled clinical trials in most important aspects of radiation therapy in prostate cancer. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: * There are no randomized studies that compare the outcome of surgery (radical prostatectomy) with either external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized low-risk prostate cancer. However, with the advent of widely accepted prognostic markers for prostate cancer (pre-treatment PSA, Gleason score, and T-stage), such comparisons have been made possible. There is substantial documentation from large single-institutional and multi-institutional series on patients with this disease category (PSA < 10, GS < or = 6, < or = T2b) showing that the outcome of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy is similar to those of surgery. * There is fairly strong evidence that patients with localized, intermediate risk, and high risk (pre-treatment PSA > or = 10 and/or GS > or = 7 and/or > T2) disease, i.e. patients normally not suited for surgery, benefit from higher than conventional total dose. No overall survival benefit has yet been shown. * Dose escalation to patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease can be performed with 3D conformal radiotherapy (photon or proton) boost, with Ir-192 high dose rate brachytherapy boost, or brachytherapy boost with permanent seed implantation. Despite an increased risk of urinary tract and/or rectal side effects, dose-escalated therapy can generally be safely delivered with all three techniques. * There is some evidence that 3D conformal radiotherapy results in reduced late rectal toxicity and acute anal toxicity compared with radiotherapy administered with non-conformal treatment volumes. * There is some evidence that postoperative external beam radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy in patients with pT3 disease prolongs biochemical disease-free survival and that the likelihood of achieving long-term DFS is higher when treatment is given in an adjuvant rather than a salvage setting. A breakpoint seems to exist around a PSA level of 1.0 ng/mL, above which the likelihood for eradication of the recurrence of cancer diminishes. * After prostatectomy, endocrine therapy prior to and during adjuvant radiotherapy may result in longer biochemical disease-free survival than if only adjuvant radiotherapy is given. No impact on overall survival has been shown. * There is fairly strong evidence that short-term endocrine therapy prior to and during radiotherapy results in increased disease-free survival, increased local control, reduced incidence of distant metastases, and reduced cause-specific mortality in patients with locally advanced disease. * There is some evidence that short-term endocrine therapy prior to and during radiotherapy results in increased overall survival in a subset (GS 2-6) of patients with locally advanced disease. * There is strong evidence that adjuvant endocrine treatment after curative radiotherapy results in improved local control, increased freedom from distant metastases, and increased disease-free survival in patients with loco-regionally advanced and/or high-risk disease. * There is moderately strong evidence that adjuvant endocrine treatment after radiotherapy results in longer overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

For each patient the target-absorbed dose is derived from the entrance and exit doses measured by silicon diodes, on the beam axis at the patient's skin. Depending on the discrepancies observed between the measured and expected doses we have set decision levels for the corrective actions to be taken. In addition these measurements allow us to obtain information on the overall accuracy or on the quality of a specific treatment. During 5 years, 7519 patients have been measured and 79 errors were detected. Half could have induced a variation of over 10% in the dose delivered. Seventy-eight out of 79 errors were of human origin. As part of an overall quality assurance programme, it is of the utmost importance to check the dose delivered for each patient undergoing radiotherapy treatment in order to avoid systematic underdosing or overdosing

METHODS AND MATERIALS : Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p < 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up	
1	1421	[Comparison with dose-volume histograms of two conformal irradiation techniques used for the treatment of T2N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer, one with association of photons and protons and another with photons alone]. [French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52.3 years (14-85), were treated using 201 MeV proton beam of the centre de protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), 49 for a chordoma and 18 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented 2/3 of the total dose and protons 1/3. The median total dose delivered within gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 32 months (4-71), the 3-year local control rates were for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of 70.8% and 85.2%, respectively and 4-year overall survival rates of 87.7% and 75%, respectively. Fourteen tumours (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the gross tumor volume, four into the CTV and 2 in an unknown site). Seven patients died of tumour and one of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, age inferieur ou egal a 52.3 years (p = 0.002), maximum tumoral diameter < 44.7 mm (p = 0.02) and GTV < 28.4 mL (0.02), at time of radiotherapy, influenced positively the local control. According to multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. Only five (7.7%) patients presented grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In base of skull chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combined photon and proton therapy offers excellent chances of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range: 14-85 years), were treated at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), France, using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range: 60-70 CGE). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 4-71 months), the 3-year local control rates were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates 88% and 75%, respectively. 14 tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical target volume [CTV], and two without further assessment). Seven patients died from their tumor and another one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and, similarly, the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age < or = 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter < 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV < 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on local control. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure. In two thirds of the cases, relapses are located in the GTV. Maximum diameter, GTV, and age are prognostic indicators of local control. These results should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 2000, 90 patients (median age, 51.3 yr; range, 10-85 yr; male/female ratio, 3:2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. Sixty-four patients had a chordoma, and 26 had a chondrosarcoma. The proton component was delivered by the 201-MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay. The median total dose delivered to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 cobalt Gray equivalents (range, 22-70 cobalt Gray equivalents). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 3-74 mo), treatment of 25 tumors failed locally. The 3-year local control rates were 69.2% (+/-6.0%) and 91.6% (+/-8.4%) for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, a small tumor volume excluded from the 95% isodose line (P = 0.032; relative risk [RR], 0.098; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.81) and a controlled tumor (P = 0.049; RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.99) were independent favorable prognostic factors for overall survival. On multivariate analysis, a high minimum dose (P = 0.02; RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.6), a high tumor control probability (P = 0.02; RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.5), a high dose delivered to 95% of the GTV (P = 0.03; RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.15-10.2), a high GTV encompassed by the 90% isodose line (P = 0.01; RR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.29-8.44), and a small GTV excluded from the 90% isodose line (P = 0.036; RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9) were independent favorable prognostic factors for local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the cranial base and cervical spine treated by surgical resection and then by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose uniformity within the GTV. Special attention must be paid to minimize underdosed areas because of the close proximity of critical structures and to redefine and possibly escalate dose constraints to tumor targets in future studies in view of the low toxicity observed to date

Between December 1993 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years [8 - 85], M/F sex ratio: 3/2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) by a 201 MeV beam. The median total dose delivered to the tumor volume was 67 GyECo. With a median follow-up of 31 months [range: 0 - 87], 25 tumours relapsed locally. The 2- and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, at least 95% of the tumor volume encompassed by the 95% isodose (p = 0.048; RR: 3.4 95%CI [1.01 - 11.8]) and a minimal dose delivered into the tumor volume <56 GyECo (p = 0.042; RR: 2.3 95%CI [1.03 - 5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, local tumor control (p = 0.005; RR: 21 95%CI [2.2 - 200]) was a prognostic factor of overall survival. For chordomas of the base of the skull and upper cervical spine treated by surgery and irradiation combining photons and protons, the quality of irradiation, reflected by homogeneity of the dose into the tumor volume, is a major factor of local control. Close attention must be paid to minimize the underdosed areas close to critical organs. The role of surgical resection remains paramount, and a trial of dose escalation would have to consider an increase in the dose to critical organs, especially as current results indicate the low toxicity of this treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1994 and 2002, 51 patients with intracranial meningiomas of the base of the skull were treated with a combination of photon and proton RT. Median total dose was 60.6 cobalt Gy equivalent (54-64). One hundred eight eye-related symptoms were collected; 80 other symptoms were noted and followed up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 25.4 months. Acute tolerance was excellent. Out of the 108 eye-related symptoms, 106 (96%) were evaluated. Improvements were reported for 73 (68.8%) of them. Out of the 88 other miscellaneous symptoms, 81 (92%) were evaluated. Improvements were reported in 54 cases (67%). Median time to improvement ranged from 1 to 24 months after completion of the radiotherapy, depending on the symptom. We did not observe any worsening of primary clinical signs. Radiologically, 1 patient relapsed 4 months after the end of irradiation. Pathology revealed a malignant (Grade 3) transformation of the initial Grade 1 meningioma. Four-year local control and overall survival rates were, respectively, 98% and 100%. Stabilization of the tumor was observed in 38 cases (72%), volume reduction in 10 cases (20%), and intratumor necrosis in 3 cases. Two patients complained of Grade 3 side effects: 1 unilateral hearing loss requiring aid and 1 case of complete pituitary deficiency. CONCLUSION: These results stressed the clinical efficacy of fractionated-associated photon-proton RT in the treatment of meningiomas, especially on cranial nerve palsies, without severe toxicity in almost all patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

The time between start of helium ion treatment and recognition of metastatic disease ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 27 months). The mean pretreatment tumor height in the patients with metastases was 7.7 mm. All 42 patients who developed metastatic disease have died. The median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease was 5 months; the longest survival was 49 months. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (n = 34). Four (10%) of the 42 patients with metastases also had local recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis identified three variables that predicted independently the development of metastases and lack of survival. These variables are anterior location of tumor (P = .027), tumor height greater than 5 mm (P = .02), and tumor diameter greater than 10 mm (P = .0075)

The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis.

A 74-year-old patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago and started on the endocrine therapy with LH-RH agonist. He had no apparent distant metastasis, and received radiation therapy 8 years ago. He has complained of low back pain since several months ago. A high uptake on bone scintigram and osteolytic and osteoblastic damages on CT were noted in pubic bone and sacrum. The PSA level was less than 0.2 ng/ml. Pathohistological diagnosis by biopsy of the pubic bone was chondroblastic type osteosarcoma, showing an atypical cell proliferation with osteoid. Immunostaining for nonepithelial marker vimentin was positive. He underwent heavy ion radiation therapy for osteosarcoma at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. Osteosarcoma is one of the rare delayed complications after radiation therapy and requires biopsy for correct diagnosis

Signs of an increased longitudinal relaxation time, T1, were found when normal bone marrow was replaced by malignant cells, polycythemia vera or reactive marrow. A shortened T1 was indicated in 4 patients in bone marrow regions treated by radiation therapy; the marrow was most likely hypocellular in these cases. The estimated T1 relaxation times were highly correlated to the cellularity of the bone marrow as assessed by histology. Among patients with close to 100 per cent cellularity neither T1 nor T2 discriminated between the various malignancies or between malignant and reactive, non-malignant bone marrow. Characterization of tissues in terms of normalized image intensities was also attempted, the motive being to avoid approximations and uncertainties in the assessment of T1 and T2. The normalization was carried out with respect to the image of highest intensity, i.e. the proton density weighted image. The results were in agreement with those for T1 and T2. It was concluded that MRI is valuable for assessing bone marrow cellularity, but not for differentiating between various bone marrow disorders having a similar degree of cellularity

Chordomas are uncommon primary malignant tumors of bone that typically occur in the axial skeleton including the sacrum, vertebrae, and skull base. The base of skull tumors usually are not amenable to complete surgical resection, and most require postoperative radiotherapy. The natural history of skull base chordoma is typified by slow locally invasive tumor progression and eventual death, although few parameters are known that allow stratification of patients into prognostic groups. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with skull base chordomas treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital by proton beam irradiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up information were reviewed in an attempt to identify clinical and pathologic parameters that predicted outcome. RESULTS. Female sex, tumor necrosis in preradiation treatment biopsy, and tumor volume in excess of 70 ml were each independent predictors of shortened overall survival after radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. CONCLUSIONS. Stratification of patients with skull base chordoma into poor and good outcome groups can be performed using the three parameters identified in our study. In addition, the striking difference in survival between the sexes suggests that further investigations of these tumors should include determination of their hormonal receptors status and consideration of hormonal manipulation in their management

We enrolled 27 patients (cT1-2, cN0). The first 6 received a dose of 800 cGy, 6 1000 cGy, 10 1200 cGy and 5 1500 cGy. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with a conventional schedule, 4000 cGy total dose, was performed after wound healing. The median gap between IOERT and EBRT was 8 weeks. Three patients with adverse prognostic factors undergoing chemotherapy, including doxorubicin or taxanes, received EBRT after completion of chemotherapy. One patient with a prosthesis implant had yielding of the surgical scar 8 months after IOERT (after 4 cycles of doxorubicin and 4 cycles of CMF complicated by frequent mastitis). Another patient with a large serum collection in the axilla manifested delayed scar formation. In the others no significant increase in healing time or surgery-related morbidity was observed. Another 4 patients developed mastitis. The cosmetic outcome was good in 26/27 patients. This treatment is well tolerated at all IOERT doses delivered. In the follow-up, to date, there have been no local relapses

Their general aim is to increase local tumor control rates while keeping the radiation induced complications below desired thresholds. IMRT is currently widely introduced in clinical practice. However, the more complicated IMPT is still under development. Especially, spot- scanning techniques integrated in rotating gantries that can deliver proton or light ion-beams to a radiation target from any direction will be available in the near future. We describe the basic concepts of intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT). Starting from the potential advantages of hadron therapy inverse treatment planning strategies are discussed for various dose delivery techniques of IMPT. Of special interest are the techniques of distal edge tracking (DET) and 3D-scanning. After the introduction of these concepts a study of comparative inverse treatment planning is presented. The study aims to identify the potential advantages of achievable physical dose distributions with proton and carbon beams, if different dose delivery techniques are employed. Moreover, a comparison to standard photon IMRT is performed. The results of the study are summarized as: i) IMRT with photon beams is a strong competitor to intensity modulated radiotherapy with charged particles. The most obvious benefit observed for charged particles is the reduction of medium and low doses in organs at risk. ii) The 3D-scanning technique could not improve the dosimetric results achieved with DET, although 10-15 times more beam spots were employed for 3D-scanning than for DET. However, concerns may arise about the application of DET, if positioning errors of the patient or organ movements have to be accounted for. iii) Replacing protons with carbon ions leads to further improvements of the physical dose distributions. However, the additional degree of improvement due to carbon ions is modest. The main clinical potential of heavy ion beams is probably related to their radiobiological properties	
1	3728	Radiation therapy for arteriovenous malformations: a review.[see comment]. [Review] [65 refs]	Boston, Brain, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Massachusetts, Mortality, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Recurrence, Research	There have been numerous case reports and series of patients treated with partial brain irradiation, linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and Bragg peak therapy for inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These cases are summarized and compared. There is convincing evidence that radiation therapy does have a role in obliterating carefully chosen inoperable lesions. The changes that occur in vessel walls after radiation are reviewed. Data about x-ray and gamma radiation are mostly historical and difficult to evaluate because of the techniques of partial brain irradiation. There is a lack of data about the volume of AVM treated and the minimum dose delivered to the AVM nidus. For gamma knife, heavy particle, and linear accelerator therapy, more complete data are available. The incidence of hemorrhage during the first 2 years after treatment, when radiation-induced vascular changes are proposed to occur, is approximately 2.6% per year for gamma knife therapy, 2% per year for proton beam therapy, 2.3% per year for helium beam therapy, and 2.3% per year for linear accelerator therapy. These rates are similar to the recurrence rate for hemorrhage of 2.2 to 3% per year expected based on the natural history of untreated AVMs. If AVM obliteration after therapy is not achieved, the incidence of recurrent hemorrhage remains between 2% per year after treatment with gamma knife therapy. The incidence of hemorrhage for all patients treated was reported as 0.15% per year in one study and 20% over 8 years in a follow-up study using proton beam therapy. Mortality from hemorrhage after treatment was 0.6% after gamma knife therapy, 2.3% after helium beam therapy, and 2 to 5% after proton beam therapy. These figures for mortality are all lower than the 11% observed for the natural history of untreated AVMs. Permanent neurological deficits experienced as a complication of radiation occurred in 2 to 3% of patients treated with gamma knife therapy, 4% of patients treated with helium beam therapy, 1.7% of patients treated with proton beam therapy, and 3% of patients treated with stereotactic linear accelerator therapy. Proton beam therapy has been used for both small and large lesions. The majority of lesions in patients treated with gamma knife, helium beam, and linear accelerator therapy have been small (usually less than 3.0 cm average diameter) lesions. In these patients with small inoperable lesions treated with accurately directed fields of isocentric radiation, the greatest incidence of AVM obliteration has been observed on follow-up angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 65]

[Review] [12 refs] [Japanese]	Cancer Care Facilities, Gamma Rays, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Relative Biological Effectiveness, X-Rays	Proton therapy delivers a conformed dose to the tumor, while reducing the dose to the surrounding tissues. Its relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is similar to that of conventional radiation, such as X-rays and gamma-rays. Proton therapy was first applied to humans in 1954. Thus for more than 19,000 patients have been treated. The distribution of the diseases to which it has been applied, however, has been quite limited. Although it is now performed at 17 institutions throughout the world, a hospital-based medically dedicated proton therapy system exists at only one institution. Therefore, proton therapy is considered to be an experimental treatment for most malignant diseases, and its equipment is also considered to be underdevelopment situation. In this paper, the project of proton treatment facility at the National Cancer Center (NCC, Kashiwa) is presented. Problems and future direction of our project are also discussed in this article.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with GBM were studied using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) and diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging after surgery but prior to XRT. Patients were categorized on the basis of their volumes of morphologic and metabolic abnormalities (volume of CNI > or = 2 and CNI values), normalized ADC (nADC), or rCBV values within the T1 contrast-enhancing and T2 regions. The median survival time was compared. RESULTS: A significantly shorter median survival time was observed for patients with a large volume of metabolic abnormality than for those with a small abnormality (12.0 and 17.1 months, respectively, P = 0.002). A similar pattern was observed for patients with a low mean nADC value compared to those with high mean nADC value within the T2 region (11.2 and 21.7 months, respectively, P = 0.004). A shorter median survival time was also observed for patients with contrast-enhancing residual disease than for those without the presence of contrast enhancement with marginal significance. CONCLUSION: The pre-XRT volume of the metabolic abnormality and the nADC value within the T2 region may be valuable in predicting outcome for patients with GBM. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc

The C-beams were more effective in the tumour growth inhibition than X-rays. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-beams against X-rays was 2.00. It was observed that the interactive hyperthermic (42 degrees C, for 30 min) enhancement of tumour regrowth delay by high-linear energy transfer (LET) C-beams was similar to that of combination of low-LET X-rays with hyperthermia. The thermal enhancement ratios (TER) were 6.10 and 5.57 for X-rays and C-beams, respectively. These results suggest that hyperthermic treatment is effective in radiotherapy not only by low-LET radiation but also by high-LET radiation such as C-beams. In conclusion, the depression of the tumour growth by the combined treatment of hyperthermia (42 degrees C) and the C-beams strongly suggests the available possible application of interdisciplinary cancer therapy for refractory tumours

Ratios of D0 values before and after a 6-hour incubation in plateau phase were 1.1 and 1.8 for N-ion irradiation and gamma-ray irradiation, respectively. The results show that recovery after irradiation with high-LET radiation is slow and much less than after low-LET irradiation

We have developed a dynamic intravenous coronary angiography (IVCAG) system using synchrotron radiation (SR) and have used it clinically. Four patients suspected of having angina pectoris underwent IVCAG. An SR beam was reflected asymmetrically with a silicon crystal to produce a wide (150 mm x 80 mm) and monochromatic (37 keV) X-ray beam, with an energy level to achieve high sensitivity to the contrast agent. Following an intravenous injection of contrast agent, irradiation was applied for 4 ms periods at 33 ms intervals for dynamic IVCAG at 30 images s-1. Images were acquired with an image intensifier and recorded with a digital fluorography system. The dynamic images permitted clear visualization of the coronary arteries and permitted evaluation of coronary anatomy. Two patients exhibited no stenotic lesions, one patient had a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and the remaining patient had a 25% stenosis at the site of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The total irradiation doses used for IVCAG were less than those for conventional angiography. Dynamic IVCAG can be readily used for the evaluation of coronary arteries

METHODS: Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T2-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases

At McGill University, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is given with a linear accelerator-based dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery unit. The first treatment is given using the stereotactic frame for target localization and head immobilization. Subsequent treatments are given using skin tattoos and laser alignment for target placement within the isocenter of the linear accelerator, and a modified portable halo-ring device is used for skull immobilization. Typically, a marginal dose of 42 Gy was prescribed at the margins of the lesion, divided in 6 fractions and given over a 2-week period. We report the pathological profile and treatment results in a series of 21 patients with a variety of intracranial tumors, treated in this manner between May 1987 and April 1990. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be a worthwhile procedure for the treatment of well-selected patients with intracranial neoplasms

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was sent to 198 German radiotherapy institutions. Data about patient characteristics, stage of disease, practice and fractionation of radiotherapy, outcome of therapy, etc. were systematically evaluated. 123 of 198 institutions answered the complete questionnaire (62.1%). RESULTS: Only 23 of the 123 institutions (18.7%) reported experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of adults. 18 institutions with 98 patients were evaluable. The majority of patients (72 of 98) was treated on a linear accelerator. The median single dose of radiotherapy was 2 Gy, while the median total dose was 24 Gy. 81 of 89 evaluable patients (91%) reached a local control of the treated lesion(s), 69 of those had a complete remission. Eight of 89 patients (9%) developed an in-field recurrence. 87.8% of patients experienced no acute and 97% of patients no late side effects of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis in adults in Germany is still very limited. Nevertheless, the clinical results-with high remission and local control rates-confirm the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the multidisciplinary treatment of this disease. Due to the small number of patients in this study despite higher incidence rates, the knowledge of this disease has to be multiplied in Germany. Future patients should be systematically included into a prospective radiotherapy registry

The patient characteristics were no different from those noted in previous studies. Patients were treated either with 60Co teletherapy units or 4 MeV linear accelerators with different daily (180-225) and weekly (4 times vs. 5 times) fractionation schemes. A recurrent-free survival was attained in 80% of the patients 2 years after primary treatment with radiation therapy. There were 27 local recurrences, of which 82% were salvaged with surgery for an overall adjusted survival of 95%. Patients treated on 60Co units with field sizes less than or equal to 30 sq. cm had a 15% increase in local recurrence compared with field size greater than 30 sq. cm, which could not be attributed to lower doses. Poorly differentiated tumors and those involving the anterior commissure were more likely to develop a local recurrence. Doses above 1900 ret were associated with a decrease in local recurrence in patients having anterior commissure involvement. Salvage with limited surgery for failure was effective in selected cases

Thirty-two patients who received proton radiotherapy with doses of 50-87 Gy underwent MR imaging 1-75 months (mean 22 months) after the start of irradiation. Axial T(2), T(1)-weighted imaging, and a dynamic study after a gadolinium injection were performed. The irradiated areas showed hypointense in T(1)-weighted images, hyperintense in T(2)-weighted images, and intense and prolonged enhancement on the dynamic study (maximum relative enhancement 441.8%+/-263.3 vs. surrounding liver 145.6%+/-67.7, p<0.0001). T(2) values of the irradiated areas were 50.6 to 65.8 msec greater than in the surrounding liver (p<0.005). The values increased with time, being significantly greater 13 months or longer after the beginning of the therapy than after a period of less than 3 months (p<0.05). Pathologic examinations (n = 3) indicated that the irradiated areas were composed of collapsed lobules with hepatic small vein occlusions, and rich extracellular matrices which retained extracellular fluid. MR imaging can demonstrate hepatic parenchymal changes after proton beam radiotherapy, and show the changes are irreversible	
0	1337	A new irradiation system for lung cancer combining linear accelerator, computed tomography, patient self-breath-holding, and patient-directed beam-control without respiratory monitoring devices	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Artifacts, Computer Systems, Equipment Design, Female, Fluoroscopy, Humans, Inhalation, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Man-Machine Systems, Middle Aged, Monitoring,Physiologic, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Respiration, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], Volition	PURPOSE: To introduce and assess a new irradiation technique for lung cancer that utilizes a linear accelerator and computed tomography (CT) scanner combination, along with a novel switching mechanism, which enables patients to synchronize the duration of irradiation with self-breath-holding without respiratory monitoring devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed treatment unit, a linear accelerator combined with a CT scanner (CT-linac), was used for irradiation. A novel switching mechanism, connected directly to the console of the linear accelerator, enabled the patient to control the radiation beam to correspond with the duration of self-breath-holding during a session determined by a radiation technologist. Twenty patients with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients were instructed in the technique of breath-holding during the inspiration phase using visualization of respiratory motion through fluoroscopy as a teaching aid. CT scans under patients' self-breath-holding were repeated three times, and differences in tumor position on CT images were measured. The reproducibility of tumor position was visually evaluated on electronic portal images (EPI). RESULTS: Mean maximum differences in tumor position under patients' self-breath-holding were 2.2 mm in the cranial-caudal direction, 1.4 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, and 1.3 mm in the right-left direction. Switching of the radiation beam was delayed less than 0.1 s behind patient switching. EPIs were used to determine that reproducibility of tumor position was satisfactorily accurate. CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of tumor position, during patient self-breath-holding synchronized with patient-initiated radiation and without a respiratory monitoring device, was sufficiently accurate. This novel irradiation technique for lung tumors using a combination CT-linac offers reduced PTV, sufficient reproducibility, and decreased duration of treatment

We applied this technique to stereotactic three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluated the primary therapeutic outcomes. A total of 35 patients with stage I (15 IA, 20 IB) primary NSCLC (20 adeno, 13 squamous cell, and 2 others) were treated with this technique. Patients ranged from 65 to 92 years old (median, 78 years). Twenty-three (66%) patients were medically inoperable due to mainly chronic pulmonary disease or high age. Three-dimensional treatment plans were made using 10 different non-coplanar dynamic arcs. The total dose of 60 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions (over 5-8 days) at the minimum dose point in the planning target volume (PTV) using a 6 MV X-ray. After adjusting the isocenter of the PTV to the planned position by a unit comprising CT and linear accelerator, irradiation was performed under patient-controlled breath-hold and radiation beam switching. All patients completed the treatment course without complaint. Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 8/35 (23%) and 25/35 (71%), respectively. Pulmonary complications of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria grade >2 were noted in three (9%) patients. During follow-up (range, 6-30 months; median, 13 months), two (6%) patients developed local progression and five (14%) developed distant or regional lymph node metastases. Two-year overall survival rates for total patients and medically operable patients were 58 and 83%, respectively. In conclusion, this new irradiation technique, utilizing patient-controlled radiation beam switching under self-breath-hold after precise alignment of the isocenter, allows safe high-dose stereotactic radiotherapy with sufficient margins around the CTV and reduced treatment times. Based on the initial results, excellent local control with minimal complications is expected for stage I NSCLC. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

The main objective of postoperative radiotherapy should be the sterilisation of residual cancer cells in the operative area while irradiation of the whole breast may be avoided. We have developed a new technique of intraoperative radiotherapy of a breast quadrant after the removal of the primary carcinoma (ELIOT). A mobile linear accelerator with a robotic arm is utilised delivering electron beams able to produce energies from 3 to 9 MeV. Different dose levels were tested from 10 to 21 Gy without important side effects. A randomized trial is currently ongoing in order to compare conventional irradiation and ELIOT. More than 400 patients have been enrolled. In addition a new approach for nipple and areola complex conservation, including ELIOT, is under investigation

IORT has been recently used in early stage cancer as an exclusive radiation modality, rather than as a boost, especially for breast tumours, in particular at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, where the technique has been called electron intraoperative therapy (ELIOT). Our studies on more than 1000 patients have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique and it is expected that its application will become more widespread in the immediate future. It is important to emphasise that ELIOT relies not only on new technological developments, but also on a multidisciplinary team with clear roles and responsibilities, the establishment of a programme of quality assurance with appropriate guidelines and a comprehensive staff development programme

This boost dose was 20 Gy (Paris System) for submucosal lesions (seven patients) and 25 Gy for intramural (eight patients) and extramural (ten patients) lesions. With a mean follow-up of 40.5 months, there have been five local recurrences, the latest occurring 16 months post-tumorectomy. Two of these five patients are alive and disease-free 1 year post salvage abdominoperineal resection. The 20 patients with local control have preserved a full functional sphincter and 19 of them are disease-free; there were few complications. This sphincter preserving combined approach seems promising for patients with tumors of the middle and lower rectum who cannot undergo major surgery and for selected patients who refuse abdominoperineal resection

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose in the build-up region delivered by a 6 MV treatment plan for which important skin toxicity was observed. We also investigated if the different designs of the treatment head of an Elekta and a Varian linear accelerator, especially the lower position of the Varian multi-leaf collimator, give rise to different build-up doses. For regular square open beams, the build-up dose along the central beam axis is higher for the Varian machine than for the Elekta machine, both for 6 MV and 18 MV. At the Elekta machine at 18 MV, the superficial dose of a diamond shaped 10 x 10 cm2 field is 3.6% lower than the superficial dose of a regular 10 x 10 cm2 field. This effect is not seen at 6 MV. At the Varian machine, the superficial dose of the diamond shaped field is respectively 3.5 and 14.2% higher than the superficial dose of the regular 10 x 10 cm2 field for 6 MV and 18 MV. Despite the differences measured in build-up dose for single beams between the Elekta and the Varian linear accelerator, there were no measurable differences in superficial dose when a typical IMRT dose plan of 6 MV for a head and neck tumour is executed at the two machines

These methods may become cumbersome and time-consuming if high time resolution is required or if the geometry is complex. Furthermore, it is difficult to study double-dynamic systems, e.g., to investigate the influence of time-dependent beam delivery (i.e., magnetically moving beam spots in proton beam scanning) on the dose deposition in a moving target. We recently introduced the technique of 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation to model continuously changing geometries. In intensity modulated proton therapy, dose is delivered by individual pristine Bragg curves. Dose spots are positioned in the patient by varying magnetic field and beam energy. If the movement of these dose spots occurs during significant respiratory motion, interplay effects can take place. Because of the inhomogeneity of individual subfields, the consequences of motion can be more severe than in conventional proton therapy. We demonstrate how the technique of 4D Monte Carlo can be used to study interplay effects in proton beam scanning. Time-dependent beam delivery to a changing patient geometry is simulated in a single 4D dose calculation. Interplay effects between respiratory motion and beam scanning speed are demonstrated

This is done routinely for each spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) field either by calibration measurements, by using analytical algorithms or by relying on empirical data. At the Northeast Proton Therapy Center, a monitor unit corresponds to a fixed amount of charge collected in a segmented transmission ionization chamber inside the treatment head. The goal of this work was to use a detailed Monte Carlo model of the treatment head to calculate the dose delivered to the patient as a function of ionization chamber reading, i.e. to yield absolute dose in patients in terms of machine monitor units. The results show excellent agreement with measurements. For 50 SOBP fields considered in this study, the mean absolute difference between the experimental and the calculated value is 1.5%, where approximately 50% of the fields agree within 1%. This is within the uncertainties of the data. The Monte Carlo method has advantages over analytical algorithms because it takes into account scattered and secondary radiation, does not rely on empirical parameters, and provides a tool to study the influence of parts of the treatment head on the ionization chamber reading. Compared to experimental methods the Monte Carlo method has the advantage of being able to verify the dose in the patient geometry

The relationship between dose, volume, and PG function is explored. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1982 to October 1997, 107 adults with non-PG and non-HT neoplasms (predominantly chordoma and chondrosarcomas) of the BOS were treated with PPRT after subtotal resection(s). The median age was 41.2 years (range, 17-75) with 58 males and 49 females. Median prescribed target dose was 68.4 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) (range, 55.8-79 CGE) at 1.80-1.92 CGE per fraction per day (where CGE = proton Gy x 1.1). The HT and PG were outlined on planning CT scans to allow dose-volume histograms (DVH) analysis. All patients had baseline and follow-up clinical testing of anterior and posterior pituitary function including biochemical assessment of thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal function, and prolactin secretion. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial overall survival rate was 87%, with median endocrine follow-up time of 5.5 years, thus the majority of patients were available for long-term follow-up. Five-year actuarial rates of endocrinopathy were as follows: 72% for hyperprolactinemia, 30% for hypothyroidism, 29% for hypogonadism, and 19% for hypoadrenalism. The respective 10-year endocrinopathy rates were 84%, 63%, 36%, and 28%. No patient developed diabetes insipidus (vasopressin deficiency). Growth hormone deficiency was not routinely followed in this study. Minimum target dose (Dmin) to the PG was found to be predictive of endocrinopathy: patients receiving 50 CGE or greater at Dmin to the PG experiencing a higher incidence and severity (defined as the number of endocrinopathies occurring per patient) of endocrine dysfunction. Dmax of 70 CGE or greater to the PG and Dmax of 50 CGE or greater to the HT were also predictive of higher rates of endocrine dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced damage to the HT & PG occurs frequently after high-dose PPRT to the BOS and is manifested by anterior pituitary gland dysfunction. Hyperprolactinemia was detected in the majority of patients. Posterior pituitary dysfunction, represented by vasopressin activity with diabetes insipidus, was not observed in this dose range. Limiting the dose to the HT and PG when feasible should reduce the risk of developing clinical hypopituitarism

In 10 cases a bouginage or combined dilatation and retrograde Nd-Yag-laser debulking was done before irradiation. The response of the treatment was documented by endoscopy (degree of stenoses) and symptoms (dysphagia score according to De Meester). In 95% of all cases the degree of stenoses was diminished and an improvement of dysphagia was found in 100%. The mean duration of oral uptake of properly chewed food could be prolonged to 308 days

At least a 13 grays (Gy) irradiation dose has to be used, but high morbidity is observed in case of over 11 Gy irradiation. So, no therapeutic windows have been found despite the fact that more than 900 patients were included in clinical trials. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) uses alpha emitting nuclear reactions, produced within tumoral cells by boron neutron captures. (10)B is specifically loaded inside tumoral cells via a boronated molecule, and the tissues are then irradiated with thermal or epithermal neutrons. Although this type of irradiation is yet considered as a regular method in Japan, USA and Europe have started clinical trials, currently in progress, in order to define the BNCT place in the post-operative care of high grade glioma. Non-removable tumors may benefit from boron neutron capture enhancement of fast neutron irradiation, i.e. the combination of these two methods. Preliminary studies show that a "biological" dose enhancement of 20 % could be obtained within the tumor when a concentration of 100 microg/g of (10)B is targeted into it. These concentrations are achievable by intra-arterial administration of (10)boronophenylalanine (BPA) or borosulfhydryl (BSH). Recently, some publications have also demonstrated that the thermal neutron flux yielded within the irradiated tissues could be increased. Clinical trials, using this technique, are planned in USA and Europe

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 16 primary and 11 recurrent sacral chordoma patients treated from November 1982 to November 2002 by proton/photon radiation therapy alone (6 patients) or combined with surgery (21 patients) have been analyzed for local control, survival, and treatment-related morbidity. The outcome analysis is based on follow-up information as of 2005. RESULTS: Outcome results show a large difference in local failure rate between patients treated for primary and recurrent chordomas. Local control results by surgery and radiation were 12/14 vs. 1/7 for primary and recurrent lesions. For margin-positive patients, local control results were 10 of 11 and 0 of 5 in the primary and recurrent groups, respectively; the mean follow-up on these locally controlled patients was 8.8 years (4 at 10.3, 12.8, 17, and 21 years). Radiation alone was used in 6 patients, 4 of whom received > or =73.0 Gy (E); local control was observed in 3 of these 4 patients for 2.9, 4.9, and 7.6 years. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a high local control rate for surgical and radiation treatment of primary (12 of 14) as distinct from recurrent (1 of 7) sacral chordomas. Three of 4 chordomas treated by > or =73.0 Gy (E) of radiation alone had local control; 1 is at 91 months. This indicates that high-dose proton/photon therapy offers an effective treatment option

METHODS: Among 249 patients with proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma, the authors identified 59 patients who had visual-field testing performed before treatment and at least 18 months after treatment. The visual fields, color fundus photographs, and charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of radiation papillopathy and visual-field loss after treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 59 patients reviewed (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of radiation papillopathy. Progressive visual-field loss, defined as enlargement of absolute scotoma of greater than [corrected] or equal to 30 degrees as compared with the pretreatment visual field, was noted in 67% of patients with radiation papillopathy and 73% of patients without papillopathy. In both groups, visual-field loss correlated with the area of the retina predicted to be exposed to irradiation in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive visual-field loss is common after proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma. However, the scotoma usually correlates with the area of the retina exposed to irradiation. The development of radiation papillopathy does not appear to be associated with additional visual-field defects in most cases

Two different chemotherapy regimens were used for concurrent chemoradiation. In the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was infused intravenously, followed immediately by five consecutive daily administrations of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2/day, each infused intravenously over 24 hr. As for the patients with adenocarcinoma, 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 250 mg/m2 of cytoxan and 45 mg/m2 of adriamycin were administered intravenously on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 54.4% with stage III and IV, 62.6% with lymph node metastasis on computed tomogram or MRI, 77.9% with stage I-II disease with lesion size > or =4 cm, and 50.3% with small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Side effects from concurrent chemoradiation such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were present in all 395 cases. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were observed to varying degrees, but there was no toxic death. This study suggests that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation in treating cervical cancer patients with high risk factors is effective and relatively well tolerated, with acceptable toxicity

New treatment methods may improve the therapeutic ratio either by increasing the frequency of tumor control or lessening the treatment-related morbidity, or both. There are several physical and biological reasons why particle radiation therapy may increase tumor cell killing without increasing normal tissue sequelae. After preliminary basic research, clinical trials of fast neutron and proton teletherapy were started. Over 700 patients were treated with fast neutron beams in 3 U.S. research programs. These studies will be extended to include negative pi mesons and heavy particles

0	4686	A simple technique for craniospinal radiotherapy in the supine position.[see comment]	Axis/ra [Radiography], Brain, Brain/ra [Radiography], Canada, Computer Simulation, Equipment Design, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Jaw, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Physics, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation Monitoring/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation, Skull/ra [Radiography], Spine/ra [Radiography], Spine/re [Radiation Effects], Supine Position, Supine Position/ph [Physiology], Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, User-Computer Interface	PURPOSE: Craniospinal irradiation poses technical difficulties that may be addressed with the use of the newer technologies that have become available over the past decade. The use of CT simulation allows improved target localisation and beam geometry definition while significantly reducing the treatment simulation time. We have developed a CT-based technique for whole CNS irradiation in the supine position that uses fixed field parameters, asymmetric jaws for field matching and drastically reduces simulation and treatment times. METHODS: The patient is CT scanned and treated in the supine position. The clinical target volume and relevant critical structures are outlined on a planning CT scan. Half beam blocked lateral fields with a collimator rotation are used to match the beam divergence from the superior border of the spinal field at the C2 vertebral body. The shielding for the cranial fields is generated automatically, and the dose distribution is calculated using a 3D treatment planning system. Fixed field parameters are used for the planning and treatment. The position of the isocenter of the spine field is always a fixed longitudinal distance from the isocenter of the brain fields. If multiple posterior fields are required, the isocenter of the second spine field is always a fixed longitudinal distance from that of the first and the gap between the fields is determined using virtual simulation and feathered during treatment using the asymmetric jaws of the linear accelerator. All treatment portals are filmed daily during the first week of treatment, and after each junction change thereafter. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The supine position provides numerous advantages. Patients are more comfortable, the treatment position is more reproducible, and access to the airway is possible, if necessary, for patient sedation. The use of CT simulation decreases the simulation time, allows for increased planning accuracy, and enables the use of multimodality image registration, and 3D treatment planning. The use of asymmetric jaws allows for junction feathering without changing the patient setup or using a couch angle

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. RESULTS: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application

These data were compared with those measured in normal pituitary glands obtained from four cats and seven fresh human cadavers. The T1 and T2 measured at 24 degrees C in the tumors (mean +/- SD: 1,170 +/- 80 and 123 +/- 35 ms, respectively) were significantly higher than those of cadaver pituitary (830 +/- 200 and 76 +/- 12 ms) and cat pituitary gland (790 +/- 120 and 69 +/- 10 ms). Although the absolute values were lower, similar differences were present in T1 measured at 4 degrees C. Two-dimensional T2 versus T1 plot was particularly helpful in distinguishing tumor from the normal gland. When tumors were grouped according to density on CT, histology or previous treatment (e.g., irradiation or bromocriptine), there were no significant differences in T1 values between the groups. Bound water content was not found to correlate with T1 or T2 values. We concluded that pituitary adenomas can be distinguished from normal pituitary glands by their different relaxation properties when measured at high frequency in vitro MR

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiation therapy treatment errors reported by therapists at the University of Utah between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During a 1-year period in which 22,542 external beam radiation therapy treatments were administered, 38 treatment errors (representing 0.17% of external beam treatments administered during this period) were identified and reviewed. Nine cases (0.04% of treatments) representing four types of record and verify (R&V)-related errors were identified, in which the department's R&V system played a contributory role in the treatment error. CONCLUSIONS: The common denominator among these R&V-related errors was excessive reliance upon the computer system by therapists. R&V systems eliminate some, but not all, pathways of radiotherapeutic error. Although R&V systems have assumed a crucial role in the precise and reproducible delivery of increasingly complex radiation therapy treatments, their inability to eradicate all radiotherapeutic errors coupled with their parallel ability to facilitate certain mistakes mandates vigilance on the part of the radiation therapy team. Radiation therapy treatment procedures must preserve careful oversight of R&V functions to minimize prospects for treatment error. [References: 41]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 181 patients having rectum tumour were irradiated preoperatively with 36 or 40 Gy between 1990 and 2001. The classification was made according to the modified Astler-Coller pathological staging system. The radiation treatment was carried out with telecobalt unit or high energy photon of linear accelerator after computerized radiation treatment planning. RESULTS: The most important characterizing factor for the efficiency of the preoperative irradiation is the local recurrence rate that was found to be 21.56% in our investigation. The survival rate was significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the applied dose. CONCLUSION: Our statistical analysis was applied to investigate the efficiency of the only preoperatively irradiated patients. The results are in agreement with the reported contributions

The treatment regimen consists of a total dose of 36.25 Gy delivered at 7.25 Gy per fraction over 10 days. We discuss the rationale for such a prostate hypofractionation protocol and the need for frequent prostate imaging during treatment. The CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), a linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm, is currently being used as the radiation delivery device for this protocol, due to its incorporation of near real-time kV imaging of the prostate via 3 gold fiducial seeds. Recently introduced conventional linac kV imaging with intensity modulated planning and delivery may add a new option for these hypofractionated treatments. The purpose of this work is to investigate the use of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and the Varian Trilogy Accelerator with on-board kV imaging (Varian Medical Systems Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for treatment of our hypofractionated prostate patients. The dose-volume histograms and dose statistics of 2 patients previously treated on the CyberKnife were compared to 7-field IMRT plans. A process of acquiring images to observe intrafraction prostate motion was achieved in an average time of about 1 minute and 40 seconds, and IMRT beam delivery takes about 40 seconds per field. A complete 7-field IMRT plan can therefore be imaged and delivered in 10 to 17 minutes. The Varian Trilogy Accelerator with on-board imaging and IMRT is well suited for image-guided hypofractionated prostate treatments. During this study, we have also uncovered opportunities for improvement of the on-board imaging hardware/software implementation that would further enhance performance in this regard

This paper discusses the clinical results of chest wall treatment by electron arc therapy. Twenty-one patients were treated following mastectomy, 16 electively because of high risk for local failure, and 5 because of local recurrence. One patient with advanced local-regional disease was treated primarily. During a median follow-up period of 24 months there has been one chest failure in one of the patients treated for local recurrence. No major complications were observed in skin, lung, soft tissue or esophagus, even in the 7 patients recently or concomitantly treated with multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy. In 3 patients, small areas of telangiectasia developed in the region of abutment of the electron arc field to a photon field used to irradiate the supraclavicular nodal area. We conclude that the technique as applied to these patients is safe and efficacious. In certain clinical settings it has advantage over standard, fixed field approaches to treat the chest wall

These fields and their biological risks are modified in complex ways by the presence of protective shielding. METHODS: To examine the long-term effects of space-like proton exposures on immune status, we treated female C57BL/6 mice with 3 or 4 Gy of 250 MeV monoenergetic protons or the complex space-like radiation field produced after 250 MeV protons are transported through 15 g x cm(-2) aluminum shielding. The animals were euthanized 122 d post-irradiation and lymphocyte phenotypes, hematological parameters, and lymphocyte blastogenesis were characterized. RESULTS: There were significant dose-dependent decreases in macrophage, CD3+/CD8+ T, NK, platelet, and red blood cell populations, as well as low hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. In contrast, dose-dependent increases in spontaneous, but not mitogen-induced, blastogenesis were noted. The differences in dose composition between pristine and shielded proton fields did not lead to significant effects in most measures, but did result in significant changes in monocyte and macrophage populations and spontaneous blastogenesis in the spleen. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that whole body exposure to proton radiation at doses of the order of large solar particle events or clinical treatment fractions may have long-term effects on immune system status	
1	3780	The 200-MeV proton therapy project at the Paul Scherrer Institute: conceptual design and practical realization	Cyclotrons, Head, Humans, Optics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiography, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Rotation, Switzerland, X-Rays	The new proton therapy facility is being assembled at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The beam delivered by the PSI sector cyclotron can be split and brought into a new hall where it is degraded from 590 MeV down to an energy in the range of 85-270 MeV. A new beam line following the degrader is used to clean the low-energetic beam in phase space and momentum band. The analyzed beam is then injected into a compact isocentric gantry, where it is applied to the patient using a new dynamic treatment modality, the so-called spot-scanning technique. This technique will permit full three-dimensional conformation of the dose to the target volume to be realized in a routine way without the need for individualized patient hardware like collimators and compensators. By combining the scanning of the focused pencil beam within the beam optics of the gantry and by mounting the patient table eccentrically on the gantry, the diameter of the rotating structure has been reduced to only 4 m. In the article the degrees of freedom available on the gantry to apply the beam to the patient (with two rotations for head treatments) are also discussed. The devices for the positioning of the patient on the gantry (x rays and proton radiography) and outside the treatment room (the patient transporter system and the modified mechanics of the computer tomograph unit) are briefly presented. The status of the facility and first experimental results are introduced for later reference

Collimator angle and pedestal rotations are introduced to obtain coplanar alignment of the matched junction. Furthermore, daily moving junctions are commonly used to feather out the junctional dose as additional safeguards to avoid radiation myelopathy. Helical tomotherapy integrates linear accelerator and CT technology capable of delivering CSA treatment without geometric matches or feathering of junctions. The patient is treated with helical beams in the supine position. Since CSA is used mainly in the pediatric population, the potential increase in integral dose to structures or the whole body from linac- or tomotherapy-based IMRT raises concerns of increased rates of secondary malignancies. In this study, we will present an integral dose comparison between conventional CSA (3D) and helical delivery to the CSA (TOMO) utilizing the Tomotherapy Hi-ART system for three pediatric patients. Integral dose was calculated for organ at risk (OAR), two targets (PTV-BRAIN and PTV-SPINE), entire planning CT data set and to the healthy tissue (entire CT-DATA SET minus the PTV). Overall integral dose was 8% higher in the TOMO plans for Patients #1 and #3, but 2% lower in Patient #2. DVH analysis shows that TOMO plans give lower doses to larger volumes and higher doses to smaller volumes of tissue in all three cases. The advantages of the TOMO plans are minimization of matched junctions and better sparing of most OARs. With increased computational and memory power in the tomotherapy planning station, the excess integral dose to the healthy tissue can be re-distributed within the patient and in turn the total integral dose can be same or lower than in conventional delivery. The impact of a small increase in overall integral dose and the associated risks of secondary malignancies are unknown. Long-term follow-up is needed to answer this question

The goal of this study is to evaluate tomotherapy in the delivery of CSA radiation and measurement of plan quality using physical parameters in comparing conventional (CSA-RT) and helical tomotherapy (CSA-TOMO) plans. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CSA-TOMO and CSA-RT plans were created for dosimetric comparison. Integral dose values were calculated. The ratios D50% (dose received by 50% of the organ at risk's volume) and D10% (dose received by 10% of the organ at risk's volume) were calculated representing large volumes and small volumes of organs at risk receiving significant dose. RESULTS: When considering D50% and D10%, CSA-TOMO has a dosimetric advantage over CSA-RT for most organs at risk. The body integral dose was higher for the CSA-TOMO plan by approximately 6.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Tomotherapy is a feasible alternative for treatment of CSA. Analysis shows that tomotherapy improves dose ratios over conventional radiation for most organs at risk. The impact of a small increase in whole body integral dose is unknown. Long-term follow-up will be needed to answer this question as others have argued of the possibility of increased risk of secondary malignancies due to delivery of radiotherapy with IMRT

In 281 patients with Stage IB tumors, the total incidence of pelvic failure was 6.4% (two without and 16 combined with distant metastasis). In 88 patients with Stage IIA, 12.5% failed in the pelvis (one without and ten combined with distant metastasis). The total pelvic failure rate in Stage IIB was 17.4% (22 without and 22 combined with distant metastasis). In 212 patients with Stage III, the overall pelvic failure rate was 35.8% (31 without and 45 combined with distant metastasis). Approximately 25% of the pelvic recurrences were central (cervix or vagina) and 75% parametrial. The overall incidence of distant metastasis was 13.5% for Stage IB, 27.3% for Stage IIA, 23.8% for Stage IIB, and 39.6% in Stage III. Higher doses of irradiation delivered to the medial and lateral parametrium with external beam irradiation and intracavitary insertions were correlated with a lower incidence of parametrial failures in all stages, except IB. In Stage IIA, medial parametrial doses below 9000 rad resulted in 10/78 = 12.8% pelvic failures, in contrast to one recurrence in 10 patients treated with doses over 9000 rad. In Stage IIB, doses below 9000 rad yielded a pelvic recurrence rate of 36/203 (17.7%) compared to 5/49 (10.2%) with higher doses. In Stage III there were 66/167 (39.5%) recurrences with doses below 9000 rad and 10/44 (22.7%) with larger doses. Statistically significant differences were observed among the Stage IIB (P = 0.02) and III patients (P = 0.005) respectively. The lateral parametrial dose also showed some correlation with tumor control, although the differences were not statistically significant. The survival in patients with Stage IIB and III was 10% higher in the patients treated with higher parametrial doses. However, the differences are not statistically significant. These results strongly suggest that higher doses of irradiation must be delivered to patients with Stage IIB and III, but improvement in tumor control must be weighed against an increasing number of complications. Factors other than the total doses of irradiation, such as the characteristics of the tumor and the quality of the intracavitary insertion influence the therapeutic results in irradiation of carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Other therapeutic approaches must be designed to improve the effect of irradiation in the tumor without further injury to the normal tissues. Hypoxic cell sensitizers, hyperthermia and high LET particles are under investigation

Optimal treatment for patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate is controversial. Radiation therapy is an established modality in the management of these patients, and several reports indicate the results are comparable to those achieved with radical prostatectomy. Recently effectiveness of therapy for carcinoma of the prostate is being evaluated in light of post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determinations. METHODS. A review was performed of multiple publications and data from selected institutions with large experience in the management of carcinoma of the prostate. Survival and clinical incidence of local recurrence and distant metastases were analyzed as well as preliminary data on postirradiation PSA levels. Factors that affect the outcome of therapy and relevant clinical trials are discussed. RESULTS. Reported differences in the age of patients treated with radical prostatectomy (59-63 years), irradiation (63-69 years), or observation (69-75.5 years) were identified. The effect of surgical staging on outcome of irradiation was significant. In multiple series of patients clinically and radiographically staged, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) with external irradiation was 95-100% for clinical stage T1a, 80-90% for Stage T1b,c, and 50-70% for clinical Stage T3. A correlation has been identified between the initial PSA levels and the probability from freedom of chemical failure (PSA elevation) after definitive irradiation. In five series comprising 814 patients with Stage T1c and T2 tumors, the DFS (end point chemical failure) was 95%, with initial PSA of less than 4 ng/ml, 83-92% with 4.1-10 ng/ml, 35-85% with 10.1-20 ng/ml, and 10-63% with PSA higher than 20 ng/ml. In the various series, follow-up ranged from a median of 1.5 years to a minimum of 4 years. In two series of 225 and 201 patients receiving doses of 7500-8000 cGy, less morbidity has been observed with three-dimensional treatment planning conformal radiation therapy than with conventional irradiation. New directions for future clinical trials are discussed, including dose escalation studies; use of high linear energy transfer to improve locoregional tumor control; and combination of irradiation and androgen suppression to enhance local tumor control, decrease distant metastasis, and improve survival. Preliminary results of a randomized study recently reported by RTOG strongly suggest that the use of goserelin acetate and flutamide decreases the incidence of clinical local recurrence (12.4% in 225 patients) compared with a control group treated with irradiation alone (25.2% in 230 patients) and enhances disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS. Although modern approaches to the management of patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate with irradiation are effective, investigators must continue to critically assess policies of treatment, develop appropriately designed prospective clinical trials, and define the optimal management of patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective longitudinal study of 485 low back pain patients was carried. We assess the type of pain and its irradiation, evolution in time, duration of the episodes, timetable, intensity and morning stiffness. A complete physical examination with specific tests for sacroiliac joints and neurologic examination was carried. We carried out a study of absolute and relative frequencies; calculating the rates with the chi 2 Pearson test and having a confidence of 95%. RESULTS: We found a significant relation (p < 0.0001) between the type of pain and the diagnosis groups. Proximal irradiation with functional disorders (p < 0.01) and metabolic bone diseases (p < 0.0001); the radicular irradiation and the disorders by physical agents (p < 0.001). The flare-up back pain with disorders by physical agents and metabolic bone diseases (p < 0.001). The morning stiffness was exclusive in the inflammatory diseases. In the physical examination, was found a significant relation (p < 0.0001) between the different tests with the diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: The history and the physical examination provide us symptoms and signs which let us direct towards the above diagnostic. The type of pain with its characteristics and the referred pain as a main symptoms, give us some information, which complemented with the physical examination tests, providing the base on which we support our diagnostic hypothesis, allow us the first classification of the patients; at the same time we understand as a low back pain patients suffer its problem	
0	4690	Comparison of radiosurgery planning modalities for acoustic neuroma with regard to conformity and mean target dose	Algorithms, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Hand, Humans, Lead, Light, Methods, Neuroma,Acoustic/pp [Physiopathology], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Patients, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Software	PURPOSE: To evaluate dose conformity and mean target dose in light of previous comparative studies and state-of-the-art radiosurgery delivery modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with acoustic neuromas deemed clinically suitable for linear accelerator or Gamma Knife radiosurgery were planned such that the minimum doses for any plan were equal. Gamma Knife plans were prepared in three ways: by altering the prescription of previously published data, by hand and with the assistance of an automatic planning algorithm (wizard). The linear accelerator plans were prepared utilizing a micro-multileaf collimator in both static and dynamic modes. The dose volume histogram analyses lead to a measure of conformity and the mean and minimum target dose for each plan. Statistical significance was calculated as each planning modality was compared with every other. RESULTS: All Gamma Knife plans demonstrated a statistically significantly better conformity when compared with fixed field linear accelerator techniques. When compared to linear accelerator techniques the wizard-assisted Gamma Knife plans demonstrated significantly better conformity. The mean target dose for all the Gamma Knife plans was significantly higher than that of the linear accelerator plans (19.2 Gy vs. 13.4 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: Conformity of the prescription isodose to the target shape is of major importance in radiosurgery. The modalities compared represent commercially available and widely accepted systems. Gamma Knife plans derived using the 'wizard' option and finalized by hand yield the best conformity. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel	
0	3789	A model for calculating the effects of small inhomogeneities on electron beam dose distributions	Air, Humans, Motion, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Solutions	Charged particles penetrating a medium are repeatedly deflected from their line of motion by coulomb interactions with target nuclei. This physical feature should be included in the calculation of dose distributions when the irradiated medium contains small inhomogeneities. We use the mean path taken by particles in homogeneous media to represent their motion through inhomogeneous materials. This procedure adapts wht small angle multiple scattering formalism to yield manageable, approximate solutions when a medium contains arbitrarily composed inhomogeneities. To promote the development of this procedure into an electron beam treatment planning program, we discuss the salient features which arise in connection with electron beam inhomogeneity calculations. We use a solid phantom containing an air cavity just below its surface as a particular example of a small inhomogeneity. We discuss qualitatively and quantitatively the dose distributions which result from their irradiation with an 11-MeV electron beam

Anderson Hospital/Texas A & M variable energy cyclotron fast-neutron therapy pilot study	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Clinical Trials as Topic, Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Evaluation Studies as Topic, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Genital Neoplasms,Female/rt [Radiotherapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Hospitals,Special, Humans, Male, Medical Oncology, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Particle Accelerators, Photons, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Texas	The records of 248 patients treated with fast neutrons and of 102 comparable but nonrandomized control patients treated conventionally with photons, surgery, or combined surgery and photon irradiation were reviewed. Fast neutron therapy included treatment with neutrons alone, a neutron boost after photon therapy, or a schedule of alternating neutron and photon treatments (mixed beam). The results with mixed beam irradiation were superior to those obtained with the other neutron therapy techniques, and compared favorably with the results of standard treatment methods. However, the lack of a conclusive advantage for neutron therapy in this pilot study illustrates the need for on-going randomized clinical trials	
0	3793	Implementation of total skin electron therapy using an optional high dose rate mode on a conventional linear accelerator	Canada, Humans, Lymphoma,T-Cell,Cutaneous/rt [Radiotherapy], Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Skin, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	A technique for total skin electron therapy (TSET) has been implemented using a standard accelerator that has been equipped with an optional special procedures mode to permit high dose-rate therapy with a 6-MeV electron beam. Patients are treated in a standing position using dual angled fields at a source to skin distance of 3.6 m. Dosimetric characteristics of the dual field technique were investigated for the 6-MeV beam as well as for a lower energy beam produced by the introduction of an acrylic beam degrader. A treatment stand, which incorporates the degrader in addition to devices used for patient support and shielding, is described. Acceptable beam uniformity and depth dose have been achieved while maintaining a low level of x-ray contamination. Treatment times are reasonably short since the output of the machine in the high-dose-rate mode is 25 Gy/min at the isocenter. Beam uniformity, dose rate, and x-ray contamination are relatively unaffected by the presence of the beam degrader if it is positioned near the treatment plane. The high dose-rate electron option is a useful treatment mode that provides the advantage of reduced treatment times while retaining proper functioning of all accelerator dosimetry systems and interlocks. Use of a dual field technique permits TSET in a treatment room of standard dimensions. The machine is easily set up for treatment, and patient setup is simplified through use of a customized support system

Effects of 100 and 250 microM drugs were assessed after incubation of 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Irradiations were performed with 62 MeV therapeutic protons, delivering to the cell monolayer single doses of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 Gy. Viability was evaluated 7 days after irradiation. Inactivation level was estimated using microtetrasolium (MTT) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. Combined effects of each drug and protons, were carried out using the same drug concentrations. Proton doses applied were those used in therapy, that is, 12 and 16 Gy. With the increase of drug concentration or irradiation dose, level of cell inactivation reached approximately 60%, 48 h after drug treatment or 7 days after irradiation at 16 Gy. Considering the rate of drug concentrations used, as well as the level of doses applied, it appears that HTB140 cells are more resistant to proton irradiation than to alkylating agents tested. The combined treatment with FM or DTIC and protons did not show significant changes of cell viability as compared to the effects of single agents. Since the time point for measuring cumulative effects of drug and irradiation was 48 h post irradiation, it seems that the obtained level of viability could be attributed primarily to the effects of drugs	
1	3798	Evaluation of a pencil-beam dose calculation technique for charged particle radiotherapy	Algorithms, California, Californium, Chordoma, Chordoma/ra [Radiography], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Skull Base, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate a pencil-beam dose calculation algorithm for protons and heavier charged particles in complex patient geometries defined by computed tomography (CT) data and to compare isodose distributions calculated with the new technique to those calculated with conventional algorithms in selected patients with skull-base tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Monte Carlo calculations were performed to evaluate the pencil-beam algorithm in patient geometries for a modulated 150-MeV proton beam. A modified version of a Monte Carlo code described in a previous publication (18) was used for these comparisons. Tissue densities were inferred from patient CT data on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and calculations were performed with and without tissue compensators. A dose calculation module using the new algorithm was written, and treatment plans using the new algorithm were compared to plans using standard ray-tracing techniques for 10 patients with clival chordoma and three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with helium lons at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL). RESULTS: Pencil beam calculations agreed well with Monte Carlo calculations in the patient geometries. The pencil-beam algorithm predicted several multiple-scattering effects that are not modeled by conventional ray-tracing calculations. These include (a) the widening of the penumbra as a function of beam penetration, (b) the degradation in the sharpness of the dose gradient at the end of the particle range in highly heterogeneous regions, and (c) the appearance of hot and cold dose regions in the shadow of complex heterogeneities. In particular, pencil-beam calculations indicated that the dose distribution within the target was not as homogeneous as expected on the basis of ray-tracing calculations. On average, for the 13 patients considered, only about 72% of the conedown target volume received at least 99% of the prescribed dose, whereas, 93% of the conedown volume was contained within the 95% isodose surface. This may be significant because in standard charged particle dose calculations, the dose across the spread-Bragg peak is assumed to be uniform and equal to the maximum or prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Dose distributions computed with the pencil-beam model are more accurate than ray-tracing calculations, providing additional information to clinicians, which may influence the doses they prescribe. In particular, these calculations indicate that for some patients with skull-base tumors, it may be advantageous to prescribe proton doses to a lower isodose level than is commonly done	
1	3799	New compensator design options for charged-particle radiotherapy	California, Californium, Equipment Design, Humans, Motion, Movement, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skull Base, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods], Universities	The purpose of this investigation is to propose new compensator design strategies for protons and heavier particles which are based on pencil-beam (PB) dose calculations and which significantly reduce the dose to tissues downstream from the target, yet provide acceptable target coverage under conditions of patient motion. Averaging and expansion operations are provided to improve the target coverage if the patient moves slightly during treatment, and a structure-sparing option is provided to protect critical structures lying downstream from the target. The new compensator design options were evaluated for two patients who had skull-base tumours. When the patient and compensator were perfectly aligned, the new PB compensator designs provided target coverage comparable to, if not better than, standard compensator designs for both patients. Furthermore, the volume of normal tissue distal to the target which received in excess of 95% of the prescription dose was roughly a factor of two lower for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In the event of patient motion, on average, the volume of the target receiving 95% or more of the prescribed dose was 3% less for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In conclusion, the new compensator design options evaluated in this investigation provide better protection for normal tissues distal to the target volume than standard compensator designs, with only a modest decrease in target volume coverage in the event of patient motion

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients were randomized to pion therapy (33-34.5 Gy pi), or conventional photon irradiation (60 Gy). Entry criteria included astrocytoma (modified Kernohan high Grade 3 or Grade 4), age 18-70, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or = 50, ability to start irradiation within 30 days of surgery, unifocal tumor, and treatment volume < 850 cc. The high-dose volume in both arms was computed tomography enhancement plus a 2-cm margin. The study was designed with the power to detect a twofold difference between arms. RESULTS: Eighty-one eligible patients were equally balanced for all known prognostic variables. Pion patients started radiation 7 days earlier on average than photon patients, but other treatment-related variables did not differ. There were no significant differences for either early or late radiation toxicity between treatment arms. Actuarial survival analysis shows no differences in terms of time to local recurrence or overall survival where median survival was 10 months in both arms (p = 0.22). The physician-assessed KPS and patient-assessed quality of life (QOL) measurements were generally maintained within 10 percentage points until shortly before tumor recurrence. There was no apparent difference in the serial KPS or QOL scores between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: In contrast to high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy for central nervous system tumors, such as neutron or neon therapy, the safety of pion therapy, which is of intermediate LET, has been reaffirmed. However, this study has demonstrated no therapeutic gain for pion therapy of glioblastoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred seventeen eligible patients were randomly allocated to either photon or pion therapy. No adjuvant hormone therapy was used. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 42 months (range 2-90). Acute bladder toxicity was worse in the pion arm, p = 0.2, but other acute toxicity did not differ. Late grade 2 toxicity was significantly less in the pion arm (29% at 5 years versus 48%, p = 0.002), but late grade 3 or 4 toxicity did not differ. Clinical local control was not significantly different between treatment arms (64% after 5 years with photons, 56% with pions, p = 0.6). Cause-specific and overall survival also did not differ (p = 0.7). There was a significant delay in time to first failure in the photon arm, largely as a result of decreased biochemical relapse, p = 0.01. A multivariate analysis is presented. CONCLUSION: Pion therapy was well tolerated, with increased acute toxicity and significantly decreased late tissue injury. This contrasts with the late toxicity observed with higher LET particle therapy such as neutron therapy. No improvement in local control with pion therapy was observed

In this series, the 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 41% with a 5-year crude survival rate of 36%. The results are analyzed according to tumour presentation and tumour doses. Six of 15 patients with tumours larger than 6 cm have had a lasting locoregional control. During the same period 43 other patients received radiotherapy as a post-operative modality. Results obtained in this group confirm the previously published data. While recent studies tend to demonstrate the specific efficacy of high LET radiation in the management of locally advanced salivary gland tumours, radical conventional radiotherapy can still be employed with a curative intent when neutron facilities are not available

The beam was adequately filtered and angled in order to create dual fields. The uniformity of the dose distribution to the patient was 10%. The relative dosimetry of the dual beam was performed using a silicon diode and an ionization chamber in a standard water phantom. X-Omat V films were irradiated in a cylindrical PMMA phantom in order to obtain the dose distribution for the six TSET dual fields used in the treatment. Absolute dosimetry was carried out with a calibrated ionization chamber placed in a cylindrical water phantom. The dose contribution per monitor unit of the single dual beams was determined with this method

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 53 patients treated to fields encompassing the cauda equina were reviewed for the onset of neurologic symptoms in the absence of local failure. All doses were normalized to equivalent dose delivered in 2-Gy fractions. Median cauda dose was 65.8 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (range, 31.9-85.1). Median follow-up was 87 months (range, 14-217 months). RESULTS: Nineteen patients experienced local recurrences, and 13 others had neurologic toxicity. A total of 54% (i.e., 7/13) of the toxicities occurred 5 years or more after treatment. Median caudal dose was 73.7 CGE in the group with neurologic toxicity, and 55.6 CGE in those without. On multivariate actuarial analysis, cauda dose and gender were statistically significant for neurotoxicity at p = 0.002 and p = 0.017, respectively. The estimated tolerance doses 5 years from treatment, TD 5/5 and TD 50/5, were 55 CGE and 72 CGE, respectively, for males and 67 CGE and 84 CGE for females. The tolerance doses were about 8 CGE lower when estimated at 10 years from treatment. Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 66% and 53%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the probability of neurotoxicity is a relatively steep function of dose to cauda equina (slope gamma50 = approximately 3). The cauda equina tolerance is greater for females than males by about 11 CGE (at 2 CGE per fraction). Extended follow-up is necessary to accurately assess neurologic damage and then differentiate that phenomenon from local recurrence; the traditional 5-year assessment has limited meaning in this population. Local control remains an issue for these patients, even with the radical doses used

Although this tumor is radio-resistant and located in a very radiosensitive organ, a conservative approach using radiotherapy is feasible for small or medium size melanomas. The physical and radiobiological basis of the techniques presently used, brachytherapy and protontherapy, are presented together with the complications inherent to each treatment. Future prospects discussed concern the association of hyperthermia with conventional irradiation and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The relevance of each technique with reference to the size and location of the tumor is discussed. [References: 196]

Therefore, 10B is selectively carried into tumours, being linked to a molecular vehicle. The tissues are then irradiated with thermal neutrons, and the boron neutron capture leads to the formation of alpha and 7Li particles which produce high levels of radiolytic damage along their range of 10 microns. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) uses a thermal/epithermal neutron beam for irradiation, while boron neutron capture potentiation uses the addition of the captures in a fast neutron irradiation. A first trial, conducted in 1951 to 1961 in the USA to test BNCT on patients suffering of glioblastoma, was a failure, essentially because 10B was located in the cerebral capillaries rather than in the tumoral cells. Today, with great improvement in the boronated compounds which show an uptake preferentially inside the cells; the quality of neutron beams; and the knowledge of the microdosimetry of the technique, this technique may be clinically used to increase the local control of radioresistant tumours, like the high grade gliomas, cutaneous or uveal melanoma, and perhaps soft tissue sarcomas.

DESIGN: Systematic literature study. METHOD: Systematic electronic searches were carried out in 12 databases according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, without restriction as to year of publication or study design. Manual searches of bibliographies and journals were also performed. The inclusion criteria were: at least 20 patients and a follow-up of at least 2 years. In addition, experts on the subject were consulted by correspondence for their opinion. RESULTS: The search identified 36 relevant articles on proton therapy and 15 on ion therapy. Based on prospective and retrospective studies, proton irradiation emerged as the treatment of choice for ocular tumours, chordomas and skull-base tumours. For prostate cancer, the results were comparable with the best results of photon therapy. Ion therapy was still in an experimental phase. CONCLUSION: According to the current literature, proton therapy is looked upon as the preferred treatment modality for certain rare tumours, such as ocular tumours, chordoma, and skull-base tumours. However, charged particle therapy as a whole, and especially ion therapy, is not supported as the treatment of choice for cancer by published evidence. Nevertheless, the potential theoretical benefit of this treatment is great. [References: 68]

The treatment planning for dynamic radiosurgery is a three-dimensional problem, since during treatment both the gantry and the couch rotate simultaneously, the gantry from 30 degrees to 330 degrees and the couch from 75 degrees to - 75 degrees. The patient surface and anatomical information is obtained from a family of computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans, and a stereotactic frame is used for target localization, treatment setup, and patient immobilization during the treatment. The dose calculational algorithm follows the gantry and couch rotation in an incremental fashion, and relies on measured stationary beam central axis percentage depth doses and dose profiles to calculate the normalized tissue-maximum-ratio distributions over a matrix of points defined on one of three orthogonal planes (transverse, sagittal, or coronal). The dose calculation algorithm is discussed in detail and calculated dose distributions for single plane and dynamic radiosurgery compared with measured data

Irradiation is fractionated and bi-lateral with horizontal accelerator photon beams of 8 MV (1988-1992) at a source-surface distance (SSD) of 3.36 m and 10 MV (1992-1993) at an SSD of 4.62 m. The main aims were maximum patient comfort, a simple, accurate set-up with overall times per fraction of 30 min or less, dose homogeneity throughout the body within +/- 10 to +/- 15%, pre-irradiation treatment planning on nine CT slices using our commercial IGE RTplan (1988-1992) and Target 2 (1992-1993) treatment planning systems and, most important, verification of the plans by in vivo dosimetry to within +/- 5%. Verification of the planned lung doses, which are distributed over five CT slices, was given special attention. In part I of this paper we describe the preliminary work, most of which was done prior to patient treatment. This consisted of standard dosimetric measurements (central axis depth doses, beam profiles at several depths, build-up and build-down curves, beam output calibrations, effect of body compensators, etc), in evaluating silicon diode dosimeters for in vivo dosimetry and of adapting and verifying the methods of treatment planning for TBI conditions. The results obtained with phantoms, including a Rando body phantom, showed that, in principle, our aims could be achieved. The final proof depended, however, on an analysis of the results of the in vivo work and this forms the subject of part II of this paper

Fifty-nine patients received photon treatment, 20 low-dose neutrons (LDN) and 20 high-dose neutrons (HDN). Eight patients received a combination of photon and neutron therapy, due to machine breakdown, and one patient received only one exposure, due to intercurrent illness. The three-year survival for all groups was 43% but there was no difference in survival between the treatment groups. The complication rate in the photon group was low--minor 3%, major 5%. The complication rates in the neutron groups were higher--LDN 30% and 15% respectively, HDN 15% and 10% and combined 25% and 37%. Only six patients died of complications related to therapy--photons 2, LDN 1, HDN 1, combined 2. No therapeutic gain for neutron therapy has been found in this study

In this work the effect of air and lung cavities and the depth dose distribution in the near and distant vicinity of the inhomogeneity is studied. By means of thermoluminescence detectors TLD-300 the total absorbed dose is measured in mixed neutron-photon radiation fields in the used polystyrene phantom with embedded inhomogeneity. Lung tissue is simulated by cork. Differences in the concentration of hydrogen between inhomogeneity and surrounding soft tissue lead to new build-up effects. These cause an increase behind and a decrease of the total dose beside and in front of the inhomogeneity. In case of the cork inhomogeneity an absorbed dose increase of maximally 20% in comparison to the absorbed dose in the homogeneous phantom was found. With air as inhomogeneity the increase of absorbed dose reaches a maximum of 30% compared to the homogeneous phantom

The NIRS (National Institute For Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan) was the first dedicated medical centre for cancer with more than 1200 patients exclusively treated with carbon ion from 1994. A three-year 70 to 100% local control was reported for radio-resistant cancers, supporting the use of high LET particles. Hypo-fractionation was particularly explored for lung cancers and hepatocarcinoma (4 sessions only). Dose escalation studies demonstrated a tumour dose-effect and permitted to precise dose constraints for healthy tissues especially for the rectum. More than 140 patients were treated with carbon ion exclusively or associated with photons since 1997 in the GSI laboratory Gesellschaft Fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany). A very high local control was also obtained for radioresistant cancer of the base of the skull. Preliminary clinical data seem to confirm the expected therapeutic gain with light ions, due to their ballistic and radio-biological properties, and justify the European projects for the construction of dedicated medical facilities for cancers. The French "Etoile" project will be integrated in the European hadrontherapy network "Enlight", with the objectives to coordinate technologic, medical and economic features

The main task is to estimate the cost per treated patient. The cost analysis is restricted to the therapeutic phase from the hospital point of view. An original methodology for cost assessment per treatment protocol is developed based on standard costs. Costs related to direct medical activity are based on the production process analysis, whereas indirect and non direct medical costs are allocated to each protocol using relevant cost-drivers. The resulting cost model will take into account the specificities of each therapeutic protocol as well as the particularities of each of the European projects

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Harvard Medical School, Boston. PATIENTS: From 1991 to 2002, 23 patients with newly diagnosed adenoid cystic carcinoma with skull base extension were treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy. There was tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus in 61% of patients (14), nasopharynx in 61% (14), clivus in 48% (11), and cavernous sinus in 74% (17). The extent of surgery was biopsy alone in 48% (11), partial resection in 39% (9), and gross total resection with positive margins in 13% (3). The median total dose to the primary site was 75.9 cobalt-gray equivalent. The median follow-up of all surviving patients was 64 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Locoregional control and disease-free survival and overall survival rates. RESULTS: Tumors recurred locally in 2 patients at 33 and 68 months, respectively. No patients developed neck recurrence. Eight patients had distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence. The local control rate at 5 years was 93%. The rate of freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years was 62%. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 5 years were 56% and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant adverse factors predictive for overall survival were change in vision at presentation (P = .02) and involvement of sphenoid sinus and clivus (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose conformal proton beam radiation therapy results in a very encouraging local control rate in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the skull base. Changes in vision at presentation and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus and clivus are important prognostic factors

[Russian]	Adult, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Chemical Industry, Chromosome Aberrations/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Gamma Rays, Gamma Rays/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], Male, Middle Aged, Plutonium, Radiation	The origin of multiaberrant cells (MACs) was studied by comparing the structure and intensity of chromosome damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of two groups of people: workers of Siberian Chemical Plant differing in the content of plutonium-239 in their bodies, and inhabitants of a non-polluted settlement (control group). Plutonium-239 is known to be a long-lived densely-ionizing source of alpha-radiation with high linear energy delivery; therefore, it has a stronger effect on cell hereditary structures than gamma-rays. In persons with the content of plutonium-239 higher than 13 nCu, the frequency of MAC was 0.105% which at least tenfold exceeds the spontaneous level. The chromosome-type aberrations that are usually induced by ionizing radiation predominated in MACs. Our results suggest that MAC formation may be caused by internal body irradiation with the incorporated sources of densely-ionizing radiation

Our aim was to measure the scattered dose to the contralateral breast, thyroid and gonads during radiation therapy after conservative breast surgery. Thermoluminescent dosimeters, LiF Mn Ti (3 x 3 x 0.9 mm3), were used to measure scattered radiations outside the treated area. They were positioned on the skin of the patients in small (2 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick) perspex holders. Each measurement was performed once per treatment and six dosimeters were used--two on the contralateral breast, one on the midpoint of the medial side and one on the midpoint of the lateral side; two on thyroid lobes and two on the pelvis. The minimum dose to the contralateral breast (p < 0.002) and the maximum dose to the gonads (p < 0.003) were significantly higher in the 60Co group than in the LINAC6 group. The mean values of the minimum doses to the contralateral breast were significantly different (p < 0.007) in the whole series when beam area values were lower or higher than the median value (176 cm2). In the whole series the beam area and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast were correlated (Pearson, p < 0.001); the beam area and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast (p < 0.005), the gantry angle for the lateral beam and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast (Spearman, p < 0.001) exhibited statistically significant correlations. Of 30 patients, 16 were irradiated with 60Co (group A) and 14 with LINAC6 (group B). In group A the average scattered dose to the contralateral breast ranged 0.53-2.15 Gy, 0.66-1.91 Gy in the thyroid, 0.14-0.19 Gy in the gonads. In group B the average scattered dose to the contralateral breast ranged 0.36-2.07 Gy, 0.53-0.98 Gy in the thyroid and 0.08-0.12 Gy in the gonads. In the LINAC6 group the beam area and the minimum dose to the thyroid exhibited a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.009), as well as the beam area and the maximum dose to the gonads (p < 0.006), the beam area and the minimum dose to the gonads (p < 0.02), the gantry angle of the lateral beam and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast (p < 0.02). In the 60Co group no correlation was statistically significant, except for the correlation between the beam area and the minimum dose to the gonads (p < 0.001). Our experience confirms the scattered dose to depend on head treatment, beam area, gantry angle and wedge angle. Finally, the literature on this subject is reviewed

The question is no longer whether cure is possible, but rather, how can cure be best achieved. With better understanding of the biology of Hodgkin's disease and with continued evolution of treatment approaches, the goal of curing all patients with Hodgkin's disease is clearly within reach. This article provides a summary of current concepts in the biology and management of Hodgkin's disease. Staging, treatment options, and complications of therapy are discussed. [References: 34]

The value of radiotherapy is discussed, reviewing retrospectively the treatment results obtained in 41 patients irradiated for orbital NHL between 1958 and 1966. All were histologically verified. There were 15 lymphomas of low and nine of high malignancy according to the Kiel classification. Among the 17 remaining patients, 15 cases had been classified as reticulum cell sarcoma and two as lymphosarcoma. Fourteen cases were in stage IE, 19 in stage IIE, and eight in stage IIIE/IVE. After surgical biopsy (n = 25) or resection (n = 5), megavoltage irradiation was delivered in conventional fractionation from 20 Gy up to a total dose of 50 Gy. During the last decade treatment has been based on CT scans and corresponding computer assisted treatment planning. Clinically, complete remission was achieved in 13 out of 14 patients (93%) with stage IE, in 17 out of 19 patients (90%) with stage IIE, and in five out of eight patients (63%) with stage IIIE/IVE. The nonrecurrence rate is 65% (10 out of 14) for stage IE and 75% (13 out of 17) for stage IIE after a mean follow-up time of 36 months. As regards lymphomas of low and high malignancy, the nonrecurrence rate is 89% and 43% respectively. Recurrence (n = 8) and dissemination (n = 6) occurred only twice more than two years after radiotherapy had been discontinued. The incidence of side effects was low. Two patients developed a "dry eye." In two eyes the lens had to be removed because of progressive cataract.

The tumor areas were irradiated by fast electrons or cobalt 60 with 50 to 55 Gy, the lymph nodes received doses of 45 to 55 Gy. Local tumor control was achieved in 27 out of 28 patients irradiated immediately after surgery (96%). In case of demonstrated lymph node invasion, local control was achieved in 14 out of 19 cases (74%). The median survival was 9.6 years for patients in stage T1/2, N0, M0 and 2.5 years for patients in stage T1-4, N+, M0. The first two years following to therapy were decisive for the prognosis. Among those of our patients who developed recurrences during this period, not one could be cured in the long run. Two years after the end of therapy, the survival probability of patients without lymph node metastases becomes comparable to the survival curve of normal male population of the same age. In the treatment of penile carcinoma, a gradual proceeding depending on the stage is recommended for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. In case of lymph node metastases, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy should be taken into consideration

However, recent evidence has suggested that RT is not curative in most patients with acromegaly when normalization of the serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) level is used to define remission. Therefore, we evaluated the success of RT based on IGF-I level in the 47 patients who received RT as part of their treatment from the cohort of 161 patients with acromegaly seen by us between 1981 and 1999. Four patients in whom no post-RT IGF-I level was available were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 43 patients, 32 patients received external beam RT, 6 received fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery, 4 received gamma-knife RT, and 1 received proton beam RT. The most recent IGF-I levels in these 43 patients, obtained a mean of 5.2 yr post-RT (range, 0.8-13.2 yr), were compared to age-adjusted normal ranges. IGF-I levels were normal in 17 patients (39.5%) without the addition of medical therapy. The percentage of patients with a normal IGF-I level generally increased with time post-RT; 27% of patients less than 6 yr post-RT, but 69.2% of patients 6 yr or more post-RT had normal IGF-I levels. Using the more traditional criterion for cure, a random GH measurement, 74% of patients had a GH level below 5 ng/mL, and 44% had a GH level below 2.5 ng/mL and would have been considered in remission based on these criteria. We conclude that with time RT remains a useful adjunctive treatment for many patients with acromegaly. RT should be considered along with appropriate medical therapy in selected patients who do not achieve normalization of IGF-I level after surgery or for those resistant to medical therapy

In addition, the expression of radiation-induced damage in humans not only depends upon total dose, dose rate, linear energy transfer (LET), and fractionation and protraction of total doses, but also on repair mechanisms, bystander effects, and exposure to chemical carcinogens, tumour promoters and other toxins. It also depends upon the levels of anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumour promoting agents. Low doses of ionizing radiation should not be considered insignificant with regard to increasing the incidence of somatic mutations (neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases) and heritable mutations in humans owing to its interaction with other toxins that can enhance damage produced by irradiation. It is very prudent to continue to support the well-established radiobiological concept that no radiation dose can be considered completely safe, and that all efforts must be made to reduce both the radiation dose and biological damage, no matter how small that damage might be, without sacrificing the benefits of radiation. Based on the results of many scientific experiments, formulations containing multiple antioxidants for biological protection against radiation damage in humans can be developed, and this strategy together with the existing physical concept of radiation protection, should further reduce potential risks of low doses of ionizing radiation in humans.

METHODS: Fifteen patients (average age, 48.6 years) with biopsy-proved cervical cancer were included in the study. After clinical staging (FIGO classification), MR imaging with body coil (BCMR) and subsequently with endorectal surface coil (ECMR) was performed. Using a 1.5-Tesla unit, axial and sagittal proton density weighted and spin echo T2-weighted and fast spin echo T2-weighted sequences were obtained with body and endorectal surface coil. During imaging analysis, special attention was paid to the uterine zones, the vaginal fornix, and the parametrial tissue. Ten patients were treated surgically (postsurgical histopathology was considered the gold standard), five patients, all clinically staged IIIb, underwent primary radiation therapy. RESULTS: Clinical staging with FIGO classification was accurate in 12 of 15 patients, and understaged in 2 and overstaged in 1 patient. Body coil MR showed accurate staging in 13 of 15 patients. Using this technique, understaging of 2 patients, both with only minimal tumor infiltration depth (< 8 mm), was performed. Endorectal surface coil MR was accurate in 14 of 15 patients missing minimal parametrial tumor infiltration in 1 patient. Histopathology (n = 10) revealed 3 patients with tumor stage T1b, 2 with stage T2a, and 5 patients with stage T2b. CONCLUSIONS: Although suggested by only a small number of patients, ECMR appears to be the most accurate modality for staging cervical carcinomas but seems to be unreliable in the detection of minimal tumor infiltration

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI), that allows in vivo measurements of the concentration of brain metabolites such as choline-containing phospholipids (Cho), may provide in vivo biochemical information helpful in distinguishing areas of tumor recurrence from areas of radiation effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients who had undergone resection and post-operative radiotherapy for a cerebral glioma became newly symptomatic. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the intravenous infusion of contrast material, and in one case, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), could not differentiate between the possibilities of recurrent glioma and radiation effect. The patients underwent 1H-MRSI prior to reoperation and the 1H-MRSI results were compared to histological findings originating from the same locations. RESULTS: A high Cho signal measured by 1H-MRSI was seen in areas of histologically-proven dense tumor recurrence, while low Cho signal was present where radiation changes predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The differentiation between the recurrence of a cerebral glioma and the effects of post-operative irradiation was achieved using 1H-MRSI in these two patients whose conventional neurodiagnostic imaging was equivocal for such a distinction. Where these two conditions are present, metabolite images from 1H-MRSI, such as that based on Cho, can be co-registered with other imaging modalities such as MRI and may also be integrated with functional MRI or functional PET within a multimodal imaging-guided surgical navigation system to assure maximal resection of recurrent tumor while minimizing the risk of added neurological damage

All of these patients had received alpha-particle radiation to their pituitary glands during the period when this form of therapy was given for diabetic retinopathy. Extraocular muscle palsy developed in 11 of these patients, iridoplegia in six, and fifth nerve damage in six. All of the palsies developed within a short period following their irradiation, and a definite dose relationship was present. The dose rate was approximately 100 rads/min for all cases. Fractionation varied but it is known for all cases. The estimated doses to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cranial nerves was calculated at a saggital plane 13 to 15 mm from the pituitary by using computer-drawn dosimetry charts for the respective aperture size. The energetic alpha particles were produced by the 184-in synchrocyclotron at Berkeley, Calif. A dose relationship for radiation palsies was apparent

Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRSI were performed in 16 patients with prostate cancer who were considered high risk because of clinical stage T3-4, Gleason score>/=8, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL. Patients were treated with chemotherapy/hormone therapy, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, and were followed for PSA relapse (follow-up, 19-43 months). The ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate was used to localize peripheral zone cancer. An MRSI risk score on a scale of 0-3 was derived from the volume and degree of metabolic abnormality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging risk score, MRI tumor/node (TN) stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA were used as predictors of pathologic stage in patients treated with RP (n=10) and PSA relapse in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage (P<0.01) and MRSI risk score (P<0.05) correlated with pathologic stage, but clinical stage did not (P=0.35). Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage was the only significant predictor of PSA relapse in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). Although the MRSI risk score did not reach significance (P=0.13), 6 patients with a score<0.9 were relapse-free, whereas 7 of 10 patients with a score>0.9 relapsed. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI risk assessments agreed in 15 of 16 patients. These preliminary results suggest that tumor metabolic assessment may indicate treatment outcome in high-risk patients with prostate cancer. Although MRSI did not provide added prognostic value to MRI in this small number of patients, MRSI might increase the confidence of the clinician in assessing risk on MRI by contributing supporting metabolic data

For most cancer sites, the risk model is one in which age-specific, relative risk coefficients are obtained by taking a geometric mean of the coefficients derived from the atomic bomb survivor data using two different methods for transporting risks from the Japanese to the U.S. population. The risk models are applied to estimate organ-specific risks per unit dose for a stationary population with mortality rates governed by 1980 U.S. vital statistics. With the exception of breast cancer, low-LET radiogenic cancer risk estimates are reduced by a factor of 2 at low doses and dose rates compared to acute high dose exposure conditions. For low dose (or dose rate) conditions, the risk of inducing a premature cancer death from uniform, whole body, low-LET irradiation is calculated to be 5.1 x 10(-2) Gy-1. Neglecting nonfatal skin cancers, the corresponding incidence risk is 7.6 x 10(-2) Gy-1. High-LET (alpha particle) risks are presumed to increase linearly with dose and to be independent of dose rate. High-LET risks are estimated to be 20 times the low-LET risks estimated under low dose rate conditions, except for leukemia and breast cancer where RBEs of 1 and 10 are adopted, respectively

[French]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Eye Enucleation, Female, France, Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes/du [Diagnostic Use], Lead, Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Optic Nerve, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Iodine 125 curietherapy is one of the conservative treatments of uveal melanoma. The technique used to achieve these results was simplified through the physical characteristics of the radioelement and the optimized-dosimetry program employed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 78 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine 125. About 100 Gy were delivered to the superior pole of the tumour. The minimal length of follow-up was 17 months and the average, 67 months. RESULTS: There was 88% local control, leading to lowered visual acuity in 76% of the cases. Radiation retinopathy, directly related to proximity to the macula, is the principle etiology. Seven patients died of hepatic metastasis, five patients were enucleated. Four patients were further treated with protontherapy to make up for noncontrol locally. CONCLUSION: One dose of 100 Gy to the superior pole of the tumor seemed to lead to good local control, with the exception of complications related to proximity to the macula and the optic nerve. In this attempt to optimize irradiation, the time lapse between any benefit in local control derived from irradiation and posttherapeutic complications observed remains insufficient to evaluate any relationship

We retrospectively analyzed our experience in 239 patients to assess treatment outcome with this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1990, 239 uveal melanoma patients were treated with 125I plaques at the University of California, San Francisco. High intensity 125I seeds in the range of 3-20 mCi were used to give a minimum tumor dose of 70 Gy in 4 days. Initial mean tumor size was 10.9 mm x 9.2 mm x 5.5 mm with a range in tumor diameter from 4 to 18 mm and tumor height from 1.9 to 11.1 mm. Best corrected pre-treatment visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 92% of patients. RESULTS: Local tumor control was maintained in 91.7% of patients with a mean follow-up of 35.9 months; 19 patients had local tumor progression; mean time to progression was 27.3 mo (1.8 to 60.1 mo). Actuarial local control is 82% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrates significant correlation of local failure with larger maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0008), closer proximity to the fovea (p = 0.0001), lower radiation dose (p = 0.0437), and smaller ultrasound height (p = 0.0034). The actuarial incidence of distant metastases is 12% at 5 years with multivariate analysis showing significant correlation only with maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0064). Visual outcome is 20/200 or better in 58% of patients. CONCLUSION: While the tumor control rates appear favorable, ocular morbidity is significant. A current randomized trial comparing 125I plaque with Helium ion therapy is in progress with specific comparison of tumor control, survival, and visual outcome

There were 14 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 39.6 years. Six patients had chondroid chordomas. The most common presenting symptoms were headache and diplopia, and the most common presenting sign was extraocular palsy. Fifty-three operations directed at removal of the tumor were performed. Twenty-three patients received various forms of radiation therapy postoperatively, including conventional external beam therapy, heavy charged particles, and interstitial implants. The average length of follow-up is 5.6 years. Eleven of 26 patients have died; the mean duration of survival in this group, excluding 1 perioperative death, was 4 years and 2 months. Although the average survival time of 6 years and 4 months was the same in patients with typical chordomas (excluding the perioperative death and 1 patient lost to follow-up) and in those with the chondroid variant, all of the latter are still alive, whereas more than half of the patients with typical chordoma have died

Thirty-two patients were studied, 12 of whom underwent brachytherapy with 106Ru plaques and 20 of whom were treated with accelerated protons. After a follow-up period of 12 months, the following was observed: reduction of the thickness of the tumor (significantly greater in the tumors which underwent brachytherapy) and morphological and structural changes which consisted in a thinning of the tumor and an increased reflectivity

The cosmetic outcome was excellent in 107 patients (82%), acceptable in 17 patients (13%), and unacceptable in six patients (5%). Complete axillary dissection (CAD) was more morbid than limited axillary dissection (LAD) as a means of preradiotherapy staging of the axilla. The former was more often associated with breast edema, hematoma formation, and subsequent development of arm edema than the latter. A multivariate analysis revealed that the four most dominant variables associated with the attainment of an excellent cosmetic outcome were: 1) the performance of a conservative biopsy procedure; 2) small breast size (cup size A and B); 3) the use of electron energies equal to or less than 12 MeV; and 4) the presence of primary tumors less than or equal to 4 cm in diameter when adjusted for breast size. Postexternal beam supplementation to the area of the primary tumor was accomplished with electrons in 107 patients (82%) and with interstitial implantation in 23 patients (18%). Excellent cosmetic results were achieved in 97 of the 107 patients (91%) treated with electrons. The use of electrons appears to produce local control and cosmesis equal to that of interstitial implantation if specific indications and guidelines are followed, and is superior to implantation in certain clinical settings

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large clinical series of patients with intraocular melanoma to determine if light irises are associated with increased risk of death from these tumors. METHODS: A total of 1162 patients treated with proton irradiation between 1984 and 1996 were observed through 1997. RESULTS: Iris color in the patients was blue or gray in 48%, green or hazel in 30%, and brown in 23%. Tumors in patients with blue or gray irises were less heavily pigmented (P<.001) and closer to the optic disc and macula (P<.001). Five- and 10-year metastasis-related death rates were 0.14 and 0.21, respectively, for those with blue or gray irises and 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, for those with darker irises (P = .02). In a Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for tumor characteristics, patients with blue or gray irises died of metastatic disease at a rate 1.90 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.85) that of patients with brown irises. The rate of metastatic death was not significantly elevated for those with green or hazel irises (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.23). CONCLUSION: Patients with blue or gray irises appear to be at increased risk of metastatic death from choroidal melanoma, independent of other risk factors

METHODS: CDI was performed on 122 untreated and 76 previously irradiated tumors using a Q2000 color Doppler ultrasound unit. Spectral analysis was performed on all detectable vascular regions within the tumor to obtain estimates of the peak systolic and end diastolic flow velocities and resistive index ((syst-diast)/syst). RESULTS: Vessels were detected in 93% of the untreated tumors and in 63% of the treated tumors (p<0.001, X2), and the median number of vascular regions found was higher among untreated tumors (3 vs 1, p=0.001, Wilcoxon Rank Sum). The effect of treatment status on the detection of tumor vessels was significant (p=0.039), controlling for age, sex, largest tumor pretreatment diameter, and tumor height at CDI in a logistic regression model. Mean resistive index was lower in the untreated tumors (0.53 vs 0.58, p=0.0050), controlling for tumor height and other covariates in an analysis of variance. CONCLUSIONS: On examination with CDI, irradiated tumors had fewer detectable vascular regions and greater resistance to flow than untreated tumors, a pattern consistent with known radiation effects

Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned

Five observers were asked to identify and orient polyvinyl chloride cylinder images on both original and contrast-enhanced portal films taken with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. Fixed reviewing periods (T) were alloted of 20, 40, and 60 s as well as unlimited viewing time in order to increase the clinical relevance of this comparison. A scoring system and a probability representation were used to compare the original and enhanced films as a function of T. The results show a substantial increase in object detectability for the enhanced films at the short viewing times (T = 20, 40, and 60 s). For longer times (T greater than or equal to 80 s) the object detectability for enhanced and original films is not statistically different

Less known is the influence of such diagnostic findings on decisions of the therapist. An analysis of this influence might help to compare the value of CT and MRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 104 treated patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx (n = 54) and the paranasal sinuses (n = 50). The study analyzed the influence of CT on primary tumor diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment decision, therapy planning, detection and time of recurrences and retreatment of relapses. RESULTS: Tumors of the nasopharynx: The value of CT for tumor staging was 76% but there was no influence on treatment decision. Radiotherapy planning was influenced in 37% of cases. CT for follow-up was done in 22% of cases. Most relapses occurred within the first 2 years. Paranasal sinus tumors: There was no influence of CT on primary diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor staging was influenced by CT in 94%, treatment decision in 44% and radiotherapy planning in 60%. CT control immediately after therapy was of value in 40%. Most relapses were found within 3 years but some in the 4th and 5th year. Some patients survived 3 to 9 years after retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In tumors of the nasopharynx there is less influence of CT on therapy strategies than diagnostic radiologists might think. No CT is needed for treatment decision since radiotherapy is the only choice of treatment. CT influenced radiotherapy planning however, in about 1/3 of our cases answering sufficiently the 2 main questions: tumor spread into the anterior half of the facial skull or involvement of the base of skull. The retreatment of recurrences detected by CT showed poor results. Late recurrences seem to have better prognosis. We recommend therefore routinely 1 basic CT 6 months after primary treatment followed by 1 CT yearly from the 3rd to 5th year. MRT might offer more diagnostic details than CT. However, at present therapy is not influenced much by this. Since CT is cheaper and faster, MRT could be discussed as additional procedure when CT presents equivocal findings and this fact could be decisive for therapy planning. Paranasal sinus tumors: The influence of CT on tumor-staging and treatment decision is high and convincing. CT helps also at radiotherapy planning and control of tumor response after therapy. CT has high value in detecting recurrences. Retreatment could control disease in some of our patients for 3 to 9 years. Better results could be achieved possibly with earlier diagnosis of recurrence. We propose therefore a basic-CT 6 months after first treatment and 1 CT routinely from the 2nd to 5th year. From the therapist's point of view we recommend CT as first imaging procedure in sinonasal tumors. MRT, more time- and cost consuming, should be applied when CT is equivocal and treatment decision could be influenced

The analysis of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes after irradiation by the accelerated ions 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon and LET 10.7 keV/microm was carried out. Blood samples were irradiated on Nuclotron of the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The doses of irradiation were in the range from 0.05 up to 1.0 Gy. Was shown that the frequency of unstable chromosome aberrations depends from the dose of ionizing radiation and can be described by linear function. At the doses 0.25-0.50 Gy the dose-independent curve was obtained for dicentrics and centric rings. The frequencies of dicentrics and centric rings as markers of the radiation action were slightly different for different donors that could be explained by different radiosensitivity. Using the calibration curve obtained earlier for gamma-rays coefficients of relative biological efficiency of accelerated 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon were defined: they varied from 1.0 at the doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) up to 3.2 at the lower doses (0.05-0.25 Gy)

Fourteen patients were treated with surgery alone: eight patients with primary tumors in the sacrococcygeal region were treated with radical surgery and four are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) with follow-up of 8 to 20 years. Recurrent tumors in six patients were treated with surgery alone resulting in long palliation (3-25 years). The actuarial survival rate at 5 years for all patients treated with surgery was 76%. Radiation therapy was used in patients after either a biopsy (15), partial excision (17), or before radical excision in 2 patients. To achieve a worthwhile level of palliation, doses greater than 4000 cGy were required. High-dose levels (greater than 6500 cGy) were achieved in nine cases by a combination of photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The results to date of this approach for lesions of the base of skull and cervical vertebral body are encouraging: high local control and low morbidity. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of all patients treated with radiation was 50%

Neutrons are produced by bombarding a beryllium target with 65 MeV protons. A CNPF of 2.8 was adopted. As far as soft tissue sarcomas are concerned, 32 patients were irradiated after "radical" surgery: only 2 local recurrences were observed (follow-up from 6 months to more that 5 years). On the other hand, in a group of 26 patients with large inoperable, recurrent of incompletely resected tumours, local control could not be achieved in 14 cases. In the whole group of these 58 patients, 12 severe complications were observed; their frequency increases with field size which in turn reflects tumour extent. Locally extended prostatic adenocarcinomas (stage C) were treated with mixed schedule irradiation (3 neutron and 2 photon fractions per week). A local control rate of 93% at 1 year, of 83% at 2 years, and 90% at 3 years was achieved (28, 23 and 10 patients respectively). The early and late tolerance was excellent; only one complication was observed

A local control rate of 91.5% (43/47) was achieved, and 70% of the patients are alive. 28 patients were irradiated with gross tumour present at the time of neutron therapy (recurrence, incomplete resection, inoperable): a local control was achieved in 5/28 cases (18%), and 68% of the patients are alive. A complication rate of 16% was recorded which was directly related to the treatment volume

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with medication refractory idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia were treated with a single fraction of 80 Gy to the trigeminal nerve root. For treatment delivery, a 4-mm collimator and a 7-arc technique were delivered using a stereotactic floor stand system with an isocenter stability of 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm to minimize dose to the brainstem. Treatment delivery time was approximately 55 minutes. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 1-40 mo), 57% of patients achieved complete pain relief and 75% (exact 95% confidence interval, 55 to 89%) had their pain reduced to 3 or less on a 10-point pain scale. Median time to pain relief was 1 month. Four patients did not respond to treatment. The actuarial mean time to pain recurrence in responders was 14 months, and the actuarial mean response duration in major to complete responders was 16 months. Women had significantly longer mean time to pain recurrence than men (16 versus 7 months; P = 0.05). Three patients reported new mild facial numbness after radiosurgery and one patient developed neurotrophic keratopathy. CONCLUSION: Linear accelerator-based radiosurgery for medication refractory trigeminal neuralgia provides effective pain relief with a low complication rate

During a period of three days, three daily fractions of 3 Gy each were applied with intervals of four hours, resulting in a total dose of 27 Gy. Using this fractionation schedule introduced by Ammon, a reduction of metastasis-associated pain was achieved in 90% of cases (54/60). The onset of pain reduction was observed earlier than seen with conventional fractionation schedules (five fractions of 2 Gy each per week, total dose 40 Gy). With regard to objective treatment effects, no significant difference was found between accelerated irradiation and conventional fractionation, the rate of remineralization being 43% (26/60), and the rate of stabilization of formerly progressive bone destructions being 55% (33/60). Accelerated irradiation was tolerated well usually. Marked acute side reactions occurred in only one case with metastatic involvement of joint and reaction of synovia. The major advantage of accelerated irradiation is the shortening of the total treatment period and the consequent reduction of treatment stress in patients with advanced cancer

The patients had stage T1 N0 M0 to T4 N3 M0 disease. Patients with T1 N0 M0 disease (273) had an excellent long-term survival (90%) as did those with T2 N0 M0 disease (142), whose 5-year survival was 70%. Patients with more advanced disease but no nodal spread did not respond as readily to radiotherapy; the 5-year survival was 40%. All patients were treated using a parallel pair set-up 6 X 6 cm lateral neck fields. A more aggressive radiotherapy regime to a larger tissue volume to include microscopic spread to lymph nodes may improve survival of locally advanced disease

The patients have been attended to at the Medical Radiation Institute of Tubingen between 1977 and 1982. In 95 cases sole radiation was performed as operation was impossible. The other patients underwent a combined surgical-radiotherapeutical treatment. The joint doses of radiation applied ran from 50 to 70 Gy in five to seven weeks' time. In particular we considered the total survival rate according to tumor stage, the local tumor control and the period until relapse. 22% of the primarily irradiated patients achieved complete remission, 42% reached particular remission and 15% achieved minimal tumor remission (total response rate: 79%). Merely in 8% of the cases the tumor did not respond perceptibly. In the other cases irradiation had to be interrupted because of general worsening, or the patients got lost to post-therapeutical observation. The total survival rates, all stages taken into account, arose as follows: one year: 36.8%, two years: 12.6%, five years: 7.3%. After sole radiotherapy in 67% of the cases which had a radiologically verified relapse more than six months passed by before a local recurrence tumor was stated. The bad prognosis of the esophagus carcinoma, as demonstrated in literature, is entirely confirmed-the negative selection of our patients taken into account. The high rank of radiotherapy in achieving effective palliation is emphasized

The median follow-up is 17 months. In 51 patients (48.5%) initial PSA levels exceeded the maximum normal value of 20 ng/ml. Nine patients kept non-declining high levels just after radiotherapy. Only one of these is free of disease. Assuming PSA levels decrease exponentially during radiotherapy, a mean half-life of 62 days (median 54, SD 26 days) was calculated. Three out of five patients with a PSA half-life of more than 88 days relapsed as compared to a 8% (3/37) relapse rate in patients with a "normal" half-life. Prolonged PSA half-life suggests residual disease. PSA levels are expected to further decrease after radiation. Six months after irradiation persistent high PSA levels were found in 14/51 (27.5%) patients. Only four of them had no evidence of manifest disease. Important negative prognostic factors for disease control in our series were non-declining high levels of PSA, a PSA serum half-life exceeding 88 days and persistence of elevated PSA values longer than six months after treatment. In our opinion, PSA is a valuable marker in the follow-up of prostate cancer patients during and after radiotherapy

Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 3,561 patients who underwent conformal radiation for prostate cancer. Therapy consisted of proton irradiation of the prostate and seminal vesicles and X-ray treatment of the pelvis when warranted. The number of treatments in which the balloon was tolerated was recorded. Results were stratified according to method of irradiation (protons alone vs. combined proton/X-ray) and method of planning (2D vs. 3D planning of X-ray fields in patients undergoing combination treatment). RESULTS: Of all the patients evaluated, 3,474 (97.6%) tolerated the balloon throughout treatment; 87 (2.4%) declined the balloon for 1 or more treatments and tolerated the balloon for 85.5% of their treatments. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant tolerance advantage in those who received protons alone compared with combination treatment (99.5% vs. 95.7%; p < 0.001). In patients undergoing combination treatment, chi-square analysis did not reveal significant tolerance differences in patients undergoing 3D vs. 2D planning for pelvic X-ray fields (95.74% vs. 95.72%; p = 0.990). CONCLUSIONS: Intrarectal balloons are well tolerated over a course of conformal prostate irradiation

This report details our experience with proton treatment of these tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-seven patients with pituitary adenomas treated with protons, who had at least 6 months of follow-up, were included in this analysis. Forty-two patients underwent a prior surgical resection; 5 were treated with primary radiation. Approximately half the tumors were functional. The median dose was 54 cobalt-gray equivalent. RESULTS: Tumor stabilization occurred in all 41 patients available for follow-up imaging; 10 patients had no residual tumor, and 3 had greater than 50% reduction in tumor size. Seventeen patients with functional adenomas had normalized or decreased hormone levels; progression occurred in 3 patients. Six patients have died; 2 deaths were attributed to functional progression. Complications included temporal lobe necrosis in 1 patient, new significant visual deficits in 3 patients, and incident hypopituitarism in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: Fractionated conformal proton-beam irradiation achieved effective radiologic, endocrinological, and symptomatic control of pituitary adenomas. Significant morbidity was uncommon, with the exception of postradiation hypopituitarism, which we attribute in part to concomitant risk factors for hypopituitarism present in our patient population

Actuarial 5 (and 8) year survival rates for clinical Stage A (N = 25), B (N = 85), and C (N = 88) disease were 96% (82), 77% (63), and 61% (38). The corresponding 5 (and 8) year relapse-free survivals were 84% (67), 68% (61), and 53% (36). Actuarial rates of clinical local failure at 5 (and 8) years were 0%, (0), 12% (20), and 15% (30) for Stage A, B, and C respectively. There was a suggestion of a decrease in the force of local and overall recurrence after 8 years, although further follow-up will be necessary for confirmation. Among 42 patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by irradiation, lymph node status appeared to be a strong predictor of distant failure (9% (3/32) failures for node (-) patients compared to 70% (7/10) for node (+) patients). Twenty-nine patients received radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for clinically palpable (Stage B and C) tumor. Only one of 16 patients treated post-operatively because of microscopic or gross residual disease has developed recurrence. By contrast, only 2 of 13 patients irradiated because of clinical local tumor recurrence remain alive and free of disease. We conclude that radiation therapy can provide effective long-term local control of prostate carcinoma, but that the ultimate radiocurability of the disease is not yet known	
1	2093	Chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull: a clinicopathologic study of 200 cases with emphasis on its distinction from chordoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Boston, Child, Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Radiation, Recurrence, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Rate	Conventional chondrosarcoma (CSA) of the skull base is an uncommon neoplasm that can resemble chordoma, and indeed it is misdiagnosed frequently as such. This has important clinical implications, because when treated with similar aggressive treatment strategies, CSA has a much better prognosis than chordoma. In an effort to identify those morphologic and immunohistochemical features that help to identify conventional skull base CSA correctly and to understand its prognosis better, particularly compared with chordoma, when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, the authors performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 200 CSAs. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 79 years (mean, 39 years), 87 patients were male and 113 patients were female, and most presented with symptoms related to the central nervous system. Approximately 6% of the tumors arose in the sphenoethmoid complex, 28% originated in the clivus, and 66% developed in the temperooccipital junction. Histologically, 15 tumors (7.5%) were classified as hyaline CSA, 59 (29.5%) as myxoid CSA, and 126 (63%) as mixed hyaline and myxoid CSA. A total of 101 (50.5%) tumors were grade 1, 57 (28.5%) had areas of grades 1 and 2, and 42 (21%) were pure grade 2 neoplasms. The vast majority of patients originated from referring hospitals, and the diagnosis was changed prospectively at our institution to CSA from chordoma in 74 patients (37%). Of the tumors studied immunohistochemically, 96 of 97 (98.9%) stained for S-100 protein, 0 of 97 (0%) stained for keratin, and faint staining for epithelial membrane antigen was seen in 7 of 88 tumors (7.95%). All patients underwent high-dose postoperative fractionated precision conformal radiation therapy with a dose that ranged from 64.2 to 79.6 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents (median, 72.1 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents, given in 38 fractions. The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%. In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively. CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management	
1	3935	A precision cranial immobilization system for conformal stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy	Boston, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Equipment Design, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Massachusetts, Methods, Motion, Movement, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Rotation, Stereotaxic Techniques	PURPOSE: Conformal radiotherapy has been shown to benefit from precision alignment of patient target to therapy beam (1, 6, 13). This work describes an optimized immobilization system for the fractionated treatment of intracranial targets. A study of patient motion demonstrates the high degree of immobilization which is available. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system using dental fixation and a thermoplastic mask that relocates on a rigid frame is described. The design permits scanning studies using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR), conventional photon radiotherapy, and high precision stereotactic proton radiotherapy to be performed with minimal repositioning variation. Studies of both intratreatment motion and daily setup reliability are performed on patients under treatment for paranasal sinus carcinoma. Multiple radiographs taken during single treatments provide the basis for a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis. Additionally, studies of orthogonal radiographs used to setup for proton treatments and verification port films from photon treatments are used to establish day to day patient position variation in routine use. RESULTS: Net 3D patient motion during any treatment is measured to be 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] and rotation about any body axis is 0.14 +/- 0.67 degrees (mean +/- SD). Day-to-day setup accuracy to laser marks is limited to 2.3 mm (mean) systematic error and 1.6 mm (mean) random error. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the most stringent immobilization requirements of 3D conformal radiotherapy adjacent to critical normal structures can be met with a high precision system such as the one described here. Without the use of pretreatment verification, additional developments in machine and couch design are needed to assure that patient repositioning accuracy is comparable to the best level of patient immobility achievable	
1	3936	Use of electrons for radiation therapy in France	Breast, Calibration, Electrons, France, Humans, Neck, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Quality Control, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization]	The development of high energy radiotherapy equipments in France between 1950 and 1990 is analyzed. The use of betatrons after a growth between 1960-1970 decreased progressively from 1975 in favour of linear accelerators (133 in 1989). Cobalt-therapy, rapidly grown up between 1960 and 1980, has reached a plateau phase with a trend to being progressively substituted by low energy linac. The dosimetric aspects are considered: calibration of electron beams, quality control and treatment planning. About 22000 cancer patients were treated in 16 Centres in 1983; of these only 23% (mean value) received electron therapy, but the number varies greatly from one center to another (9-45%). The major indications for electrons in France are: neck nodes, operated breast, internal mammary chain. The general trend is to restrict their use to lesions not deeper than 4-5 cm and first of all to employ them as a boosting treatment, after an X ray irradiation

1	2094	Conformal proton beam therapy of prostate cancer--update on the Loma Linda University medical center experience	Actuarial Analysis, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: The ability to eradicate localized prostate cancer is dependent upon the radiation dose which can be delivered to the prostate. This dose is often limited by the tolerance of normal organs (rectum, bladder). Conformal beam therapy takes advantage of the unique depth dose characteristics of heavy charged particles (the Bragg Peak) to escalate the radiation dose delivered to the prostate while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. METHOD: 643 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons alone or a combination of protons and photons. All treatment was planned on a 3-D planning system and all received doses between 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE/day. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response to treatment. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates for the entire group are 89 and 79% respectively. A statistically significant difference in biochemical disease-free survival was seen between patients in the "early" (T1b-2b, PSA < 15) and "advanced" (T1b-2b, PSA > 15 or T2c-T4, PSA < 50) subgroups (89% vs. 68% at 4.5 years, p < 0.001). A PSA nadir of less than 0.51 ng/ml predicted for the highest chance of freedom from biochemical recurrence. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton beams therapy produced high rates of response and minimal toxicity. A phase III dose escalation trial is in progress to help define the optimum radiation dose for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer	
1	924	Influence of patient age on biochemical freedom from disease in patients undergoing conformal proton radiotherapy of organ-confined prostate cancer	Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Life Tables, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Survival, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVES: To examine a large, single-institution series of patients to test the perception among clinicians that radiotherapy is preferred for "older" patients and surgery should be indicated for "younger" men. Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another

The patient is irradiated with equal doses from the right and the left side. So a dose of 10 Gy in the middle of the body is achieved which is determined individually by means of phantom measurements. In order to avoid the risk of an interstitial pneumonitis, the lung region is temporarily blinded in such a way that a dose of 8 Gy is obtained there in the middle of the body. During the irradiations, the accumulated dose is measured in different body regions with thermoluminescence dosimeters, a semi-conductor diode and, eventually, a ionization chamber. The scattering width is +/- 13%. We do our best to make the patient's position as comfortable as possible

Total body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The irradiation technique with 4 MV X-rays is described. The patients are treated without lung-shieldings. The dose-measurements show an acceptable homogeneity. The applied technique is very easy in comparison with other centers. A main point is making the patient's position as comfortable as possible. The accuracy of dose-application and dose-distribution is considered clinically acceptable

The radiotherapy followed the guidelines of the M.D. Anderson Hospital, Houston and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London using a multiple field technique. A median dose of 68 Gy megavoltage radiotherapy was given to the primary and of 66 Gy to the neck nodes independent of the histologic subtype. The determinate relapse-free survival was 45% after five years and the local relapse-free survival 61%. The multiple field technique allowed to reduce the dose to the parotid. Only 25% of the patients suffered from a dry mouth after one year and only 10% after four years

Physical aspects of quality control showed two major deviations from the protocol: one center used photon energies of more than 15 MVX without mould; another had a anterior-posterior loading of 3:1. The radiation oncology assessment detected six inadequate treatments: The safety margin was inappropriate in three of 26 mantle fields. Another center used a multiple field technique, and in two patients the paraaortic region was not irradiated

Measurement of both photon and neutron scattered dose at the position of a fetus from chest irradiation by a large field 18 MV x-ray beam was performed using an ionization chamber and superheated drop detector, respectively. Shielding construction to reduce this scattered dose was investigated using both lead sheet and borated polyethylene slabs. A 7.35 cm lead shield reduced the scattered photon dose by 50% and the scattered neutron dose by 40%. Adding 10 cm of 5% borated polyethylene to this lead shield reduced the scattered neutron dose by a factor of 7.5 from the unshielded value. When the 5% borated polyethylene was replaced by the same thickness of 30% borated polyethylene there was no significant change in the reduction of neutron scatter dose. The most efficient shield studied reduced the neutron scatter dose by a factor of 10. The results indicate that most of the scattered neutrons present at the position of the fetus produced by an 18 MV x-ray beam are of low energy and in the thermal to 0.57 MeV range since lead is almost transparent to neutrons with energies lower than 0.57 MeV. This article constitutes the first report of an effective shield to reduce neutron dose at the fetus when treating a pregnant woman with a high energy x-ray beam

Complete remissions occured in 29%; the one -- and two-year-survival-rate for all 93 patients was 38% and 24% respectively, and for patients with complete remission 74% and 44% respectively. Although there was improvement in complete remission and short term survival compared to that reported in the literature, the five-year-survival-rate (only about 5% of patients) showed no significant improvement

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 6 patients (7 eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and choroidal hemangiomas were reviewed. An exudative retinal detachment was the indication for treatment in all cases. The mean age of the 6 patients was 13 years (range, 4 to 20 years). The minimum follow-up time was 1 year. Patients were checked for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. The patients were treated with radiotherapy. A total dose of 20 Grays was applied to 7 eyes: 2 with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma underwent proton therapy and 5 with diffuse hemangioma were treated by external beam irradiation. RESULTS: Complete resolution of the subretinal fluid was achieved in all cases with the tumor height decreased. Visual acuity improved to 1 line or more in 5 eyes and remained stable in 2 eyes. Two cases that underwent proton therapy developed radiation retinopathy. CONCLUSION: External beam radiation is an effective and safe option in the management of choroidal hemangiomas complicated by retinal detachment. Based on our experience, proton therapy should be reserved for sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma	
1	1475	Concomitant diminishing magnetization-transfer effect and increasing choline level in radiation-induced temporal-lobe changes	Choline/me [Metabolism], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Research, Temporal Lobe/re [Radiation Effects]	This article reports on the use of both magnetization-transfer (MT) imaging and 1H-MR spectroscopy in two cases of bilateral temporal-lobe changes after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the first case, the following patterns were noted: (i) although the temporal lobes appeared relatively normal on T2-weighted MR imaging, corresponding MT imaging clearly showed signal abnormalities (decreased MT effect) consistent with alterations in macromolecular structure; and (ii) concomitant strongly elevated choline on 1H-MR spectroscopy was observed, and this is associated with metabolic changes in cell membranes. The second case presented similar characteristics. In addition, there was an increased lactate signal and T2 signal changes in keeping with established oedema. Both MT and proton-spectroscopic findings were consistent with postulated pathophysiological features of radiation injury, but their specificity for this condition remains unclear. Magnetization-transfer imaging, and possibly 1H-MR spectroscopy, might be sensitive techniques for the early detection of late radiation injury

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma

Optimal radiation dose appeared to be 30-40 Gy. Surgery should be performed not later than three weeks after termination of radiation treatment. Preoperative irradiation may be followed by pulmonary complications. Due to application of combined treatment of esophageal cancer, percentage of operable cases is increased. However, no effect on 5-year survival was registered

The authors submitted 23 patients complaining of LCN with CT documented intrapelvic or paraaortic tumors to palliative radiotherapy. Megavoltage external beam irradiation was administered using a 6-MV linear accelerator. Treatment field sizes ranged from 56 cm2 to 235 cm2 (mean: 150.54 cm2) and encompassed only the site where the disease involved the lumbosacral plexus or its branches. > or = 3 Gy/day fractions were used. Twenty-one of 22 assessable patients (95.4%) obtained LCN pain relief; 19 (86.3%) obtained complete LCN pain relief. The median time to pain progression (TPP) was 150 days (range: 39-510 days). The median survival was 165 days. Seven patients were LCN pain-free at death. Two patients are alive and LCN pain-free. The remaining 12 patients had recurrent LCN pain: four of them were reirradiated at the site of previous neuropathy and only two had partial relief again. The authors conclude that it is advisable to submit to palliative radiotherapy the inoperable disseminated and/or recurrent cancer patients complaining of LCN, to use large fractions not to occupy the extant time of their already short life-expectancy, and to design small fields to avoid acute side-effects	
0	1261	1H-MR spectroscopy of normal brain tissue before and after postoperative radiotherapy because of primary brain tumors	Adolescent, Adult, Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/an [Analysis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Lactic Acid/an [Analysis], Lipids, Lipids/an [Analysis], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Phosphocreatine/an [Analysis], Photons, Poland, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Research	PURPOSE: Brain metabolism after surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (pRT) because of primary brain tumors was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in vivo. The study was designed to reveal the impact of pRT on normal brain tissue metabolism, which may potentially help in delineating the target volumes for reirradiated patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Spectra of 43 patients ages 16-63 years treated with pRT for primary glial tumors in the Center of Oncology Maria Curie Memorial Institute Branch in Gliwice were analyzed. The control group consisted of spectra acquired for 30 healthy volunteers. All patients were treated with 3D conformal techniques using 6-20 MV photons to total doses of 60 Gy. Spectra were acquired from the control region before pRT and from three uninvolved regions 9-12 months after the end of pRT. Voxels were located in the region of low (<6 Gy), medium (29-39 Gy), and high radiation dose ( approximately 60 Gy). Relative intensities of the signals relating to N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), choline-based compounds, creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), mio-Inositol, lactate, and lipids were obtained. RESULTS: The spectra of "normal brain" taken 9 months after pRT are significantly different from those obtained for control volunteers and from the spectra acquired before radiotherapy. The lactate and lipids signals are very strong; however, they are not correlated with absorbed dose. NAA/Cr ratios are significantly lower than before radiotherapy even for the low-dose regions. Differences increase with radiation dose: the NAA/Cr ratio is significantly lower for the regions of brain receiving a high dose of radiation than for the low-dose areas. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of primary brain tumors (surgery + postoperative radiotherapy) causes alteration of brain metabolism, even in regions of the brain far from the postoperative tumor bed and receiving relatively low total doses of radiation. Single voxel MRS spectroscopy in vivo cannot help in delineating target volumes for secondary irradiation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84% and 77%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS

Surgical excision is often attempted after embolization. Interventional neuro-radiology is available in only a few centers. If large AVMs can be safely excised without pre-operative embolizaton, then these lesions can be treated at many neurosurgical centers. METHODS: Between January 1986 and June 1992, a total of 210 patients with cerebral AVMs were diagnosed by angiographic studies. Twenty-seven of them had large AVMs wider than 5 cm in the longest diameter. The case records of these patients were retrieved and studied. RESULTS: Two patients were treated with Bragg peak proton beam therapy. Twelve patients were treated conservatively with no improvement. Thirteen patients underwent surgery and total AVM excision was achieved in 11. None of the patients who underwent surgery had any pre- or intra-operative embolization. All the patients had no neurological deterioration post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS: Large cerebral AVMs can be treated by surgical excision alone with acceptable results

Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

A comparison was made of stimulated (excess saliva) and resting parotid gland (SPG and RPG, respectively). Following irradiation at an MT pulse of 150 Hz downfield from the water proton signal, signal reductions in SPG and RPG were 83.8 +/- 4.7 and 91.4 +/- 5.7%, respectively. The larger reduction for SPG indicates that an increase in the amount of water in gland cells for the production of more parotid saliva may lead to greater affinity between the protons adjacent to macromolecules and free water which contributes to the MT effect. Activity in the parotid gland correlates with the effect. This method is useful for diagnosing disorders of parotid gland secretion. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

The responses were 9/11 for squamous cell carcinoma, 5/10 for adenocarcinoma, 5/5 for large cell carcinoma, and 2/2 for small cell carcinoma patients. Treatment was very well tolerated and in fact, no acute radiation related complications were observed during the 10-12 week treatment duration. Radiation induced fibrosis of various degrees has occurred but it has been mostly asymptomatic and similar to what is normally seen using conventional continuous schedules. In this group of very advanced lung cancer patients, failures have mostly resulted from metastatic progression; only one patient progressed locally in the irradiated field without evidence of metastatic disease. A preliminary analysis indicates that this treatment yields results that are similar to those achieved with conventional fractionation regimens and should be explored further	
0	653	IMRT with compensators for head-and-neck cancers treatment technique, dosimetric accuracy, and practical experiences.[erratum appears in Strahlenther Onkol. 2005 Dec;181(12):810]	Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Reproducibility of Results, Risk, Time, Tonsillar Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With three-dimensional conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy (3D-c-IMRT) a heterogeneous dose distribution can be achieved in both planning treatment volume and in adjacent normal tissues and organs to be spared. 3D-c-IMRT demands for modified photon fluence profiles which can be accomplished with different techniques. This report deals with the commissioning of metal compensators and the first experiences in clinical use. Dosimetric accuracy, dose coverage and practical experience like treatment delivery time, monitor units and dose outside the treated volume are evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to April 2004, 24 patients with head-and-neck cancers were treated with 3D-c-IMRT using tin-wax compensators. The dose prescription included a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB). High-dose volume was irradiated with 60-70 Gy (median 66 Gy), low-dose volume with 48-54 Gy (median 52 Gy) administered by a standardized seven- portal coplanar beam arrangement. Dose at one parotid gland was aimed at 26 Gy. The compensators used consisted of tin granules embedded in wax; recalculation was performed with compensators made of the alloy MCP96 as well. RESULTS: In 21 of 24 patients 3D-c-IMRT with tin-wax compensators reduced the median dose to one parotid gland to < 30 Gy. Recalculation with compensators with higher density which allowed higher attenuation revealed better protection of the parotid gland. The treatment delivery time per fraction was between 6 and 12 min (plus time for patient positioning), approximately 300 MU per 2 Gy were applied. The dose outside the treated volume was increased with regard to open fields and comparable with a physical wedge of 15-30 degrees . Quality assurance and treatment of patient were fast and simple. It was shown, that calculated dose distribution corresponded to measured dose distribution with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: The described method offers facilities for a good dose coverage of irregular target volumes with different prescribed doses and a considerable dose reduction in adjacent organs at risk. The dose sparing of organs at risk can be further improved, if a compensator material with higher density is used	
0	3970	Stereotactic radiosurgery of the foramen magnum region and upper neck lesions: technique modification	Foramen Magnum/su [Surgery], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Spain	A modification of the stereotactic radiosurgical procedure to permit treatment of lesions in the foramen magnum and upper cervical regions is described. The modification consists of placing the frontal pins of the stereotactic head ring in the zigoma bone, with no changes in the position of the occipital pins, so the final BRW head ring is oblique to the orbito-meatal plane. In this new position there is room enough in the posterior part of the guide for the support scrubs. This is unhampered by the patient's shoulders and the lesion is far enough to permit setting the axial coordinate sufficiently above the head ring plane

Radiation reduces symptoms and signs of the disease in 46-93% of patients. Except for the lenses, the orbital content is resistant to the usual radiation dose of 20 Gy in 10 fractions. A number of radiotherapeutic techniques which avoid the lenses have been suggested. The testing of different techniques was performed on the same patient by using a computerized simulation of lateral alternating and crossed photon beams from a 6 MV and 18 MV linear accelerator or cobalt device. The radiation from a 6 MV linear accelerator using lateral beams angled at 5 degrees posteriori gave the best results. By this technique both lenses receive below 10% of the prescribed dose with a safety zone of 20% of the field size. Isodose distribution in clinical target volume is within the range of 10%. The described technique is recommended as it enables a successful avoidance of both lenses with a satisfactory homogeneity of dose distribution in the clinical target volume

Three years before she had undergone pituitary irradiation for acromegaly and hyperthyroidism, the latter was attributed at the time to excessive TSH secretion because of elevations in plasma TSH. During the present 11/2 years of observation, TSH levels were appropriately low and did not respond to iv TRH when the patient was hyperthyroid. Moreover, they did not rise during treatment, even as the patient became borderline hypothyroid. It is concluded that hyperthyroidism probably has always been due to Graves' disease

We adopted the concomitant boost technique which allows 1-2 weeks' shorter treatment time by delivering the boost treatment phase as second daily dose during the last part of the basic field irradiation. May 1989 to December 1992, fifty-one patients were scheduled to receive a total dose of 71-75 Gy in 40 fractions over 6 weeks. The boost encompassing the macroscopic disease was given as second daily dose during the last two weeks of the basic treatment. Severe mucositis was observed in 62% of the patients. Late side-effects occurred in 4 patients. At a median follow-up of two years (range: 12-56 months), actuarial locoregional control rate is 44% and overall survival is 54%. At univariate analysis, primary site is the only predictive factor of locoregional control (p = 0.009): neoplasms arising from the oral cavity did worse than those from larynx/hypopharynx and oro/nasopharynx. We conclude that this regimen is feasible in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of various primary sites. However, since primary site seems to exhibit a predictive value, data from controlled studies are needed to assess its role in primary sites other than oropharynx and nasopharynx

Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control	
1	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option

METHODS: The slides from 22 eyes with uveal melanoma that had undergone enucleation after the administration of 125I brachytherapy were studied. The histopathologic features of the tumor and the retina were graded. Results were compared with findings from a previously reported group of 47 proton beam-treated eyes and its control group. RESULTS: Patient age, time between irradiation and enucleation, and ciliary body involvement were similar for the 125I brachytherapy-treated group and the proton beam-treated group and its control group. This allows comparison of the histopathologic findings. Comparing the 125I brachytherapy- and proton beam-treated groups, most histopathologic features were similar with nominally statistically significant differences only for cell type, number of mitotic figures, and fibrous metaplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium adjacent to the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation of uveal melanoma induces changes in the tumor and in the surrounding retina. Brachytherapy and charged particle therapy are the 2 principal methods of irradiation. This study demonstrates that similar changes are produced by 125I plaque irradiation and proton beam irradiation

Eighty-two percent of the patients had widespread metastatic disease, and the mean tumor burden was 2,900 cc. Seventy-nine percent of the patients received concurrent radiotherapy. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain within the AA aperture (43%), systemic stress (43%), and nausea or vomiting (29%). Systemic stress was the most frequent power-limiting factor (46%). There were two treatment-related complications: sciatic neuritis from intramuscular injection (one) and pleural effusion from thermometry probe placement (one). Detailed thermal mapping and thermal dosimetry were performed on 26 patients. The mean thermal dosimetry parameters were quite low. Concurrent radiation doses were also quite low (mean, 1,500 rad) to avoid toxicity of sensitive organ systems within the abdomen. The objective response rate was only 18%, all partial, but 43% of the patients achieved effective symptomatic palliation. The five objective responders did survive significantly (P = .02) longer than the 23 nonresponders

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (pts) were selected to receive an aggressive TURB followed by 2 MCV cycles, and HFRT with concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (33 pts) or HFRT and concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (20 pts). The 5-FU and CDDP doses ranged from 180 to 220 mg/sm/day and from 4 to 6 mg/sm/day, respectively. Radiotherapy was delivered as three 100 cGy fraction per day or two 150 cGy fraction per day to a total dose of 50 Gy to the pelvis and a 20 Gy boost to the bladder. RESULTS: Grade III toxicity in pts who received or not MCV was: rectal tenesmus 12/33 and 0/20, dysuria 6/33 and 4/20, leukopenia 3/33 and 0/20, thrombocytopenia 7/33 and 1/20 pts, respectively. A Grade IV toxicity was observed in 2 pts. Of the 28 evaluable patients treated with MCV, CR were observed in 23 (82%) and PR in 5 cases. Of the 18 evaluable patients treated without MCV, CR were observed in 18 cases (100%). Actually, 65% and 14% of the CR pts treated with or without HCV are alive and free of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This bladder-sparing treatment shows an acceptable acute and late toxicity, similar to that observed with radiotherapy alone. The high CRs and bladder preservation rates observed deserve further clinical evaluation

We consider the factors influencing the peripheral dose (PD) of 10MV X-ray radiotherapy to be the distance between the caudal edge of the irradiation field and the measuring point, the size of the therapeutic irradiation field, the thickness of the lead shield laid above and lateral to the disease-free testis, and the thickness of the lateral absorber. Materials and methods: We measured the scattering radiation dose coming from the accelerator head and that due to irradiation volume. We measured these doses using a testicular phantom as the non-diseased testis.Results: Scattering radiation from the accelerator head mainly contributes to PD, whereas the larger the size of the irradiation field the more the scattering radiation from the irradiation volume contributed to PD. PD changed more at the surface of the phantom than at its center. PD at the testicular phantom could be reduced to less than 1% of the therapeutic dose when it was situated more than 5cm distant from the caudal limit of the irradiation field, the lead shield above the testicular phantom was 7.5cm thick, and the lateral lead shield was 2mm thick.Conclusions: PD is influenced by many factors. It is necessary to clarify the change in PD at the testicular phantom, and it is important to limit the caudal edge of the irradiation field and to lay the lead shield for the attenuation of radiation on the disease-free testis

The authors studied CK treatment of glioma and glioblastoma, and analyzed frequency and risk factors of radiation necrosis. Of 61 patients with glioma and glioblastoma treated with CyberKnife, four patients showed symptomatic radiation necrosis. All of these patients were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, varying from 3 to 6 fractions without previous radiation therapy. Two patients required necrotomy through craniotomy. Two patients were treated conservatively. Our four patients with radiation necrosis were not specific in terms of tumor volume and dose delivery. Glioma cells invade the normal brain tissue and over-radiation to this intermingling area is one of the risk factors for injury to normal endothelial cells. The homogeneity of the maximum dose area is an important factor to reduce over radiation to the normal brain parenchyma. The dose volume effect has been discussed in terms of risk factor; however, the number of fractions and dose per fraction should be considered to avoid radiation necrosis. We consider that conformal treatment with inverse algorism, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and precise anatomic targeting reduce the risk of radiation necrosis

Over 500 patients have now been treated. We have had very good results to date in treating patients with small tumors critically located near a radiation-sensitive organ which would preclude delivering a curative dose with conventional radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients with larger tumors where the tumor dose cannot be increased more than 10% over conventional radiotherapy have not responded well to helium ion radiotherapy. This is illustrated by discussing selected patient groups in detail, namely those with uveal melanoma, small, low-grade tumors near the central nervous system, carcinoma of the pancreas, and carcinoma of the esophagus

Helium ion treatment of tumors adjacent to critical central nervous system structures	Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Ions, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In this paper we present a technique for treating relatively small, low grade tumors located very close to critical, radiation sensitive central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain stem. A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons

[German]	Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Time, Time Factors	Survival of glioblastoma patients can be double by postoperative radiation but nevertheless rarely exceeds one year. It is therefore desirable to minimize treatment time and hospitalisation. Aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility of a reduction of treatment time by accelerated fractionation. Out of 110 patients treated for glioblastoma from 1975 to 1988 in our institution postoperative radiation was performed in 79 patients using three different fractionation schedules: 60 Gy in six weeks, single fractions 2 Gy (n = 38), 35 Gy in two weeks, single fractions 3.5 Gy (n = 27), 45.5 Gy in 2.5 weeks, single fractions 3.5 Gy (n = 14). No statistically significant differences in both the mean overall and disease free survival were evaluated between the three groups. The larger fraction size was well tolerated and no relevant increase of early or late adverse reactions occurred. As the duration of treatment can be reduced from six to two weeks, this accelerated fractionation schedule seems to be a reasonable alternative to conventional fractionation	
0	2103	Dosimetric evaluation of abutted fields using asymmetric collimators for treatment of head and neck	Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Jaw, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Universities	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to reevaluate the dose nonuniformity of abutted fields defined using asymmetric collimators and one isocenter for treatment of the head and neck region. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Bilateral parallel-opposed fields abutted to the anterior field at one isocenter were implemented in the treatment of head and neck. The effect of digital display tolerance can produce dose nonuniformity at the junction of the abutted fields. The amount of dose nonuniformity was quantified using both mathematical summation of dose profiles and by direct measurement of doses at the junction of the two abutted fields. The dose nonuniformity was obtained by irradiating the superior part of a film using bilateral parallel-opposed fields and the inferior part by an anterior field with a gap or an overlap. Dose profiles were taken at the depth of maximum dose for the anterior field across the abutted fields. The dose nonuniformity was determined for the case where the asymmetric jaw was set at -2 mm, -1 mm, 0, +1 mm, and +2 mm from the beam central axis. RESULTS: The dose at the junction increases systematically as the abutment of the fields changes from a gap to an overlap. The dose nonuniformity with 1-mm gap and 1-mm overlap is about 15% underdose and overdose, respectively. CONCLUSION: Imperfect abutment of split fields due to digital display tolerance (+/-1 mm) of asymmetric collimator can cause an underdose or overdose of 15% of the delivered dose

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1989, 84 evaluable patients were treated. PR patients (n = 45) were planned/localized on the basis of biplane angiography and treated between 1989 and 2000. BL patients (n = 39) were planned/localized on the basis of CT/MRI and treated since 2000. Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival, nidus obliteration (NO), and any radiographic improvement were undertaken with Cox regression of dose and volume effects. RESULTS: No significant complication, survival, previous embolization incidence, AVM location or size differences existed between BL/PR patients. The groups differed significantly in prescribed dose (PR: 16.2 Gy, BL: 17.3 Gy, p = 0.004) and isodose (PR: 62%, BL: 79%, p < 0.0001). Estimated 2-year NO rate was 87% for BL patients, 12% for PR patients (p < 0.0001). Ultimate PR NO rate was 67% at 6 years. Dose (p = 0.037) and isodose (p = 0.014) significantly affected PR NO outcome; volume was of borderline significance (p = 0.069). No factors significantly affected BL outcome. Analyses of small (< or = 4.0 cm3), high-dose (> or = 17.0 Gy) PR patients (PR1 group) vs. BL patients still demonstrated greater NO (p = 0.04) and radiographic improvement (p = 0.0004) rates for the BL group. PR1 patients had a 76% 3-year NO rate. CONCLUSIONS: BL-based radiosurgery achieved a high NO rate, the PR method did not. Differences in outcomes between PR/BL groups may be due to localization methods or an inherent advantage with the BL system. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel

The treatment technique consists of several moving field irradiations in noncoplanar planes at a linear accelerator facility. Using collimated narrow beams, a high concentration of dose within small volumes with a dose gradient of 10-15%/mm was obtained. The dose calculation was based on geometrical information of multiplanar CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system, which is usable at CT, MR, and positron emission tomography (PET) installations. Special computer programs for correction of the geometrical MR distortions allowed a precise correlation of the different imaging modalities. The therapist can use combinations of CT, MR, and PET data for defining target volume. For instance, the superior soft tissue contrast of MR coupled with the metabolic features of PET may be a useful addition in the radiation treatment planning process. Furthermore, other features such as calculated dose distribution to critical structures can also be transferred from one set of imaging data to another and can be displayed as three-dimensional shaded structures

A combined CP/CPMG multi-echo, multislice sequence was used to measure T1 and T2 in each pixel with an uncertainty not exceeding 10%. In a prospective clinical study, 12 patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors were investigated. For each ROI in the calculated T1 and T2 parameter images, texture parameters originating from the grey level distribution, the gradient distribution, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the grey level runlength histogram were used for classification and discrimination between tissues. All regions corresponding to the normal brain tissue (white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid) were successfully discriminated from each other as well as from the pathological tissue parts (edema and tumor). The classification of 10 edematous and 8 tumorous tissue regions yielded only one misclassification. Together with additional rules, these discrimination rules formed the knowledge base of an expert system for segmentation of the brain images. In cases of tumors without Gd-DTPA contrast medium uptake or in cases of Gd-DTPA contraindication, segmentated images can help solve nontrivial diagnostical problems such as delineating the target volume in radiation therapy

Indications for radiotherapy included unresected tumors, tumor remaining after surgery, and recurrences. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the CT, MR and the linear accelerator installations. By phantom measurements different materials (steel, aluminum, titanium, plastic, wood, ceramics) used for the stereotactic system were tested for mechanical stability and geometric MR image distortion. All metallic stereotactic rings (closed rings made of massive metal) led to a more or less dramatic geometric distortion and signal cancellation in the MR images. The best properties--nearly no distortion and high mechanic stability--are provided by a ceramic ring. If necessary, the remaining geometric MR image distortion can be 'corrected' (reducing displacements to the size of a pixel) by calculations based on modeling the distortion as a fourth order two-dimensional polynomial. The target volume was defined in dynamic, T1-weighted FLASH MR images, which were measured before, during, and after the controlled intravenous infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight Gd-DTPA. The stereotactic localization technique allows the precise transfer of the target volume information from MR onto CT data to provide a map of the radiation attenuation coefficient for dose calculation. In genera, the superior soft tissue contrast of MR showed an excellent tumor delineation, especially in regions, such as the base of the skull, where the target often was obscured in CT images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown	
1	2104	Dose calculation models for proton treatment planning using a dynamic beam delivery system: an attempt to include density heterogeneity effects in the analytical dose calculation	Algorithms, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Switzerland, Time	The gantry for proton radiotherapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is designed specifically for the spot-scanning technique. Use of this technique to its full potential requires dose calculation algorithms which are capable of precisely simulating each scanned beam individually. Different specialized analytical dose calculations have been developed, which attempt to model the effects of density heterogeneities in the patient's body on the dose. Their accuracy has been evaluated by a comparison with Monte Carlo calculated dose distributions in the case of a simple geometrical density interface parallel to the beam and typical anatomical situations. A specialized ray casting model which takes range dilution effects (broadening of the spectrum of proton ranges) into account has been found to produce results of good accuracy. This algorithm can easily be implemented in the iterative optimization procedure used for the calculation of the optimal contribution of each individual scanned pencil beam. In most cases an elemental pencil beam dose calculation has been found to be most accurate. Due to the long computing time, this model is currently used only after the optimization procedure as an alternative method of calculating the dose

A description of the facility and details of the accident are reported in Schauer et al., 1993a). In brief, during maintenance on the lower window pressure plate of a 3 MV potential drop accelerator, an operator placed his hands, head, and feet in the radiation beam. The filament voltage of the electron source was turned 'off', but the full accelerating potential was on the high voltage terminal. The operator's body, especially his extremities and head, were exposed to electron dark current. At approx. 3 months post-irradiation, the four digits of the victim's right hand and most of the four digits of his left hand were amputated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry was used to estimate the radiation dose to the victim's extremities. Extremity dose estimates ranged from 55.0 Gy (+/- 4.7 Gy) to 108 Gy (+/- 24.1 Gy)

Oncologically the combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy offers an alternative treatment option. The functional results and the complication rate in stage III and IV tumors of the oral tongue, floor of mouth and oropharynx are described in a patients series. METHOD: The follow-up includes 17 consecutive patients who were primarily treated by a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy between 1997 and 2000. The oncological benefit (complete remission, disease-free survival), the functional results (mastication, swallowing, speech and pain) and the complications were reviewed. RESULTS: After the follow-up period 16/17 patients were alive. There were 3 major complications, one of them lethal. The functional results resembled those after surgical resections. CONCLUSIONS: A combined radiotherapy is a feasible method of treating patients who refrain from surgery. Moreover the application ranges from inoperability to postoperative radiotherapy in cases with close or positive margins. In connection with neck-dissections and therapy of recurrent cancer major complications may occur. In contrast to the general opinion radiation therapy was not superior to surgical resection concerning functional sequelae

Imaging sequences were applied with and without irradiation of off-resonant radiofrequency (RF) prepulses, but other parameters were unchanged. Therefore, quantitative assessment of MTC could be performed. In contrast to former examinations of other researchers, no significant difference of MTC was found between malignant liver lesions and benign lesions as FNH or adenoma. MTC might provide differentiation between hemangioma and cysts versus solid tumors, but MTC is not capable of distinguishing benign and malignant types of solid liver tumors. Effects of unchanged MTC prepulses on signal intensity of normal liver tissue and most lesions were more pronounced for nearly proton density-weighted fast low-angle shot (FLASH) images than for T1-weighted FLASH images, obtained by using higher excitation flip angles. Liver-to-lesion contrast could not be improved clearly by MTC prepulses. The contrast between liver and lesions in the gradient-echo breath-hold images was compared with standard T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images. Liver-to-lesion contrast in the breath-hold images was found to be inferior to T2-weighted spin-echo images in 14 of 17 cases. Lesion conspicuity in regions near the diaphragm was better in breath-hold images, because problems with marked breathing motion (as in standard imaging) could be avoided

The analysis was limited to women for whom a radium body burden measurement had been obtained and who were married prior to age 45 (n = 603). Internal radiation dose to the ovary was calculated based on initial intakes of radium-226 and radium-228, average ovarian mass, number and energy of alpha particles emitted, fraction of energy absorbed within the ovary, effective retention integrals and estimated photon irradiation. Time between marriage and pregnancy, number of pregnancies and number of live births served as surrogates for fertility. Radiation appeared to have no effect on fertility at estimated cumulative ovarian dose equivalents below 5 Sv; above this dose, however, statistically significant declines in both number of pregnancies and live births were observed. These trends persisted after multivariable adjustment for potential confounding variables and after exclusion of subjects contributing a potential classification or selection bias to the study. Additionally, the high-dose group experienced fewer live births than would have been expected based on population rates. There were no differences in time to first pregnancy between high- and low-dose groups. These results are consistent with earlier studies of gamma-ray exposures and suggest that exposure to high doses of radiation from internally deposited radium reduces fertility rather than inducing sterility

METHODS: The literature was reviewed regarding recent research in the therapy of lung cancer. Emphasis was placed on newer radiation therapy (RT) techniques. RESULTS: Advances in physics and computer technology have improved radiation delivery systems. New strategies have been used, such as altered fractionation patterns, three-dimensional treatment planning, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), tomotherapy, stereotactic RT, and heavy ion RT. New technologies will make it possible to administer higher doses more precisely, which should result in better disease control, with less toxicity. CONCLUSION: Further research will improve the outcome of patients with lung cancer by providing more effective tools for the RT of this disease. [References: 41]

PATIENTS AND METHOD: 126 eyes of 118 patients (age 55-89 years; mean 74 ys.) were treated. Best distal and near visual acuity was assessed prior to (= initial visual acuity [IVA]) and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after teletherapy. Fluorescein angiography was performed prior to and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after radiation therapy. For analysis patients were divided into different groups by IVA and membrane size. Maximal duration of observation was 36 months. Teletherapy was done by a 9-MeV photon linear accelerator through a lateral port in half-beam technique with a single dose of 2 Gy up to a total dose of 20 Gy within 12 days. RESULTS: No severe negative side effects have been observed. Eight patients reported of epiphora and four patients complained of transient sicca syndrome. Visual acuity decreased more than one line in the group IVA 0.05-0.2. The group IVA 0.3-0.5 remained unchanged for 1 year. We found a tendency for increased visual acuity in group IVA > or = 0.6 for 18 months. After that time both groups showed decreased visual acuity, but all these patients reported of reduced metamorphopsia and increased color and contrast perception. CONCLUSIONS: There is an influence of low dose fractionated percutaneous teletherapy on visual acuity, subfoveal neovascular membranes and metamorphopsia. IVA and duration of anamnesis play an important role. There seems to be no persistent effect; possibly increased dosage will bring a benefit

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 899 patients, who had received the radioactive contrast medium Thorotrast for angiography in the 1930s and 1940s, and 662 controls were followed-up since 1968 every two years by standardized clinical and laboratory examinations. Initially, X-ray plain films of the thorax, upper abdomen and the former injection site were performed. In selected patients the sites of paravascular Thorotrast deposits were evaluated by ultrasonography, CT and MRI. RESULTS: Paravascular Thorotrast deposits were detected in 245 patients. Clinical symptoms related to deposits appeared 10 to 30 years after Thorotrast administration. The severity of symptoms depended on the location and extension of granulomas and were mainly caused by fibrosis, nerve paralysis and vascular changes. Four malignant tumors adjacent to granulomas were observed (one soft tissue sarcoma in the groin, two squamous cell carcinomas of the parotid gland and one lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the nasopharynx). MRI including MRA allowed an accurate determination of tissue damage, whereas the utility of US and CT was restricted due to strong sound attenuation and streak artefacts caused by the high X-ray absorption of Thorotrast. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Locoregional late effects of paravascular Thorotrast deposits mainly comprise radiation induced, fibrotic tissue destruction. The incidence of malignant tumors, in particular sarcomas, adjacent to deposits, however, is much lower than initially expected

The purpose of our study was to define parameters from single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy that provide a probability measure for differentiating neoplastic from radiation-induced, nonneoplastic lesions. METHODS: Seventy-two lesions in 56 patients were examined using a combined MR imaging and MR spectroscopy protocol (point-resolved spectroscopy, TE = 135 ms). Signal intensities of cholines, creatines, N-acetyl aspartate, and the presence of lactate and lipid resonances were correlated to final diagnoses established by clinical and MR imaging follow-up, positron emission tomography studies, or biopsy/surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test, linear discriminant analysis, and k nearest-neighbor method. RESULTS: Significantly increased signal intensity ratios I(tCho)/I(tCr) (P <.0001) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) (P <.0001) were observed in neoplastic (n = 34) compared with nonneoplastic lesions (n = 32) and contralateral normal brain (n = 33). Analysis of I(tCho)/I(tCr) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) data yielded correct retrospective classification as neoplastic and nonneoplastic in 82% and 81% of the lesions, respectively. Neither I(NAA)/I(tCr) nor signal intensitities of lactate or lipids were useful for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Metabolic information provided by proton MR spectroscopy is useful for the differentiation of neoplastic and nonneoplastic brain lesions after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors

This assumption was also supported by positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET). In contrast, proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) indicated radiation necrosis, which was confirmed histopathologically in surgical specimens. Subsequent follow-up examinations up to 19 months after surgery showed no evidence of tumor recurrence

Irradiation was realized by 5 to 7 arcs with 15 MV X rays circular minibeams of a GE-CGR Saturne 43 Linac diameter, at 100 cm 6 to 20 mm; the Betti arm chair and the Talairach frame. The prescribed peripheral dose containing the nidus was 25 Gy corresponding to the 60-70% isodose range (100% was the maximum dose). For the irradiation planning we used the 'associated targets methodology' and the ARTEMIS-3D TPS, both of which have been developped in the radiotherapy departement of the Tenon hospital. Evaluation was performed in February 1995, the follow-up range was 38 to 62 months. In 1990, 46 cases were treated for cure and were all evaluable, whereas in 1991, among the 38 irradiated cases one patient was not evaluable because of lack of arteriographic control. Thus this series consisted in 84 evaluable cases. The overall obliteration rate was 65/84 (78%), partial obliteration was seen in 18/84 (21%) and no change in 1 case. According to AVM volume, obliteration rate was: AVMs < 4200 mm3: 82% (46/56). For lesions > 4200 mm3 it was 68% (19/28). In one isocenter irradiation, the obliteration rate was 42/47 (89%); whereas it was 23/37 (62%) in multi-isocenters treatments. The obliteration rate was better for not previously treated cases: 39/44 (89%) than for previously treated nidus (mostly embolisation) 65% (26/40). In 23 spheroid AVMs obliteration rate was 87% (20/23) in 43 ellipsoid AVMs the obliteration rate was 77% (33/43); and in irregular rounded nidus, it was 67% (12/18). The peripheral dose of 25 Gys has been used in 78 cases (93%), the obliteration rate was 63/78 (81%); in 6 other cases treated with 15-23.5 Gy, it was 2/6 (33%). We observed two recurrences of haemorrhage at 4 and 6 months after radiosurgery (recurrent haemorrhage rate 2/84 = 2.4%) with total neurological recovery in one of the two patients. One patient died of myocardial infarctus 11 months after radiosurgery (there was a partial obliteration of his AVM at 8 months after radiosurgery). There was no AVM related death. One patient developed an epilepsy. [References: 25]

Method. The technique was elaborated by O. Betti in the early 80. He used several coronal arcs to irradiate the center of the target with X rays circular minibeams. Their diameter (6 to 20 mm) is chosen according to the size of the nidus. The patient is seated in a specially built armchair. His head is immobilized with the Talairach frame afixed in the calvarium by 4 special screws: they allow to remove the frame after stereotactic angiography and/or CTscan and to replace it to perform the stereotactic irradiation. The frame and the head rotate around an horizontal axis passing by the linac isocenter ie the center of the target volume. The combination of both movements: rotation of the Linac and rotation of the stereotactic frame covers a spherical sector representing the surface of portals of entry of the minibeams. The frame can slide on a plate allowing access to the entire brain. Results.The special seat and the frame are movable on curved rails allowing to avoid or reduce irradiation of the body of the patient. CONCLUSION: We have been using this system of irradiation in the seated position since 1986 to treat more than 900 patients

[Review] [26 refs]	Adolescent, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Reoperation, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Treatment Failure	PURPOSE: To evaluate repeat radiosurgery (RS2) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after failure of initial radiosurgery (RS1). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1986 and 2000, 41 patients underwent RS2. Nine patients were not assessable: seven had insufficient follow-up (RS2 in 1999 and 2000) and two had no recent control angiography data. Thus, 32 (78%) of 41 patients were assessed. Most lesions (29 [90%] of 32) were supratentorial: 22 (69%) on the left, 8 (25%) on the right, and 2 on the midline (6%). The patients had Spetzler-Martin Grade 1-5 (median Grade 3). The symptoms before RS1 included hemorrhage in 20 (63%), epilepsy in 10 (31%), progressive neurologic deficits in 2 (6%), and headaches in 6 (19%). Five patients had two or more symptoms. Twenty-two patients (69%) had received other treatment before RS1, including neurosurgery in 3 patients (9%) and one to six embolizations in 19 patients. At RS1, the median largest nidus dimension was 2.7 cm (range 0.8-5). The median volume was 2.7 cm(3) (range 1.2-9.9). The median time from RS1 to RS2 was 52 months (range 12-126). Between RS1 and RS2, 7 (22%) of 32 patients experienced bleeding. The same irradiation technique was used for RS1 and RS2, except for 2 patients who underwent RS2 at another institution. Circular 15-MV X-ray minibeams (range 6-20 mm) and coronal arcs were used. RS1 was monoisocentric in 75% of cases and multiisocentric in 25%. At RS2, the median largest nidus dimension was 3 cm (range 1.4-5). The median volume was 4.2 cm(3) (range 0.8-13.4). RS2 was monocentric in 72% of cases and multiisocentric in 28%. After RS2, the median follow-up was 19.5 months (range 0-79; mean 25.3). RESULTS: After RS2, the obliteration rate was 59.3% (19 of 32). The median time to arteriographic obliteration was 21 months (range 12-96). The survival rate was 97% (31 of 32). Five of the 13 patients with a nonobliterated nidus experienced complications; 3 had bleeding (9%) and 2 without prior neurologic deficits developed partially regressive neurologic deficits. One patient with a previously existing deficit developed an additional new partially regressive neurologic deficit after an episode of bleeding. Thus, 3 (9%) of 32 patients had neurologic complications. Moderate-grade parenchymal changes at MRI increased after RS2 (88.2% vs. 57.7% after RS1; p = 0.10, not significant). However, necrosis-like changes did not significantly increase. After RS1 failure, salvage may be attempted by embolization, neurosurgery, or RS2. RS2 should be considered after the second successive annual angiogram if reduction of the nidus is <25%. CONCLUSION: The results after RS2 are encouraging. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to reduce the initial failure rate and to choose the modality and timing of salvage treatment. [References: 26]

In the assessment of retinal hemangioblastomas it is necessary to know about VHL, an autosomal dominant disease, a multisystem familial tumour syndrome. METHODS: An overview of the diagnosis and therapy of VHL is presented. RESULTS: Minimal criteria of the syndrome are tumours in one index patient and one of the typical lesions in another first-degree relative. Retinal hemangioblastomas were already found in children. Only 5 % of patients with VHL present retinal capillary hemangioma before the age of 10 years, and most patients present between the ages of 10 and 40 years. Data suggest that retinal capillary hemangioma is usually manifested by the age of 30 years. The VHL gene functions as a tumour suppressor gene and is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3p25. The mapping of a locus for VHL has offered the prospect of presymptomatic diagnosis of the disease using DNA markers. Small retinal tumours are treated by photocoagulation, big hemangioblastomas by cryotherapy. Modern options in treatment of retinal tumours are proton therapy, plaque radiotherapy, pars-plana vitrectomy, photodynamic therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy and systemic treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor, in addition. CONCLUSIONS: The interdisciplinary Freiburg VHL study which has been in existence for more than 20 years, has shown that an extensive family screening for early detection of the disease is necessary. The assessment of the diagnosis in a VHL carrier requires close follow-up for multiple and recurrent tumours. [References: 176]

A group of 31 patients treated with iridium was opposed to a historical control group of 24 patients treated with radium. Both groups were submitted to the same method of simultaneous percutaneous irradiation. All consecutively treated patients exposed to a percutaneous focal dose of greater than 45 Gy were evaluated. The iridium and radium doses applied as well as the values measured in intestine and bladder are presented. The iridium group had the same or a slightly less favorable prognosis (prognostic factors compared: stage, percutaneous dose, histology, age) than the radium group. The remission rates were identical for both therapy methods. Patients treated with iridium have a slightly better curve of recurrence-free interval and survival time, even taking into consideration the shorter observation period. Two out of the patients treated with iridium and four out of those treated with radium presented severe long-term side effects with formation of fistulas (average incidence 12,5 months and 12,7 months after the beginning of therapy, respectively)

All patients suffered from far-advanced tumours. Sixteen were treated with neutrons exclusively, while all the others had recurrences after chemotherapy, surgery, or combined surgery and photon- or electron therapy. 29 of them received reduced doses (10 to 14 Gy), thirty patients got a full neutron course of 16 Gy (Total Effective Dose). The observation time varied from 2 to 11 months. Serious side effects occurred in 11 cases. A complete tumour regression was achieved in 35 patients, and a partial regression in 17. Recurrences developed in 5 cases, no tumour regression was seen in 2 cases. These preliminary results encouraged us to start a randomized trial of head and neck tumours according to the protocols of the EORTC Charged Particle Therapy Project Group

An analysis of these cases with a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range 12 to 45 months) is given in this report. Very preliminary results are presented for 60 patients treated with a neutron boost only. These showed a substantially lower complication rate. The major results of this phase II trial are: The survival rate of 3.5 years was strongly dependent on the stage of the tumour; for 8 patients with T1 tumours it was 100%, for 35 patients with T2 tumours, 77%, and for 69 patients with T3 tumours, 45%. The survival rate at 3.5 years was strongly dependent on surgery before the beginning of radiotherapy; for 54 patients after surgery without clinical evidence of residual tumour it was 73%, for 58 patients with inoperable primary or recurrent tumour, 47%. The survival rate of 31 patients with recurrence after neutron therapy was only 36%. The overall rate of serious complications was 28.6% after neutron therapy, but only 5% after neutron boost therapy (mean follow-up period: 12 months, range 5 to 48 months)

The disease-free survival rate at five years is 62.6% for T1-, 71.5% for T2- and 28.7% for T3-tumours (p = 0.016). Significant differences were also found for various grades, i.e. 73.3% for G1-, 47.7% for G2- (p = 0.035) and 22.4% for G3-tumours (p = 0.024). Patients without microscopic tumour residue fared best with a survival rate of 86.6%, followed by patients with microscopic tumour (65.5%; p = 0.042) and patients with gross tumour (25.5%; p = 0.003) left behind. A functional limb was preserved in 86% of the patients with extremity lesions. The local control rate of patients with gross tumour was 76.5% compared with 53% in previous photon series. This finding underlines the potential biological advantage of neutrons in these tumours. Serious side effects ranged from 28% in the patients treated with neutrons for large volumes to 7% in patients treated with a neutron boost

The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate cancer incidence from dose distributions. For this purpose, target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity-modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. The cancer incidence has been derived from the mean doses for each organ. The results of this work are: (a) Intensity-modulated treatment of Hodgkin's disease using nine photon fields (15 MV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with two opposed photon fields (6 MV). (b) Intensity-modulated treatment using nine proton fields (maximum energy 177.25 MeV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with one proton field (160 MeV). (c) Irradiation with protons using the spot scanning technique decreases the avoidable cancer incidence compared to photon treatment by a factor of about two. This result is independent of the number of beams used. Our work suggests that there are radiotherapy indications in which intensity-modulated treatments will result in little or no reduction of cancer incidence compared to conventional treatments. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment

A patient with Hodgkin's disease has been chosen as an example and has been planned with different radiation treatment modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate mortality from dose distributions. To this purpose target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. From the mean doses of each organ the mortality has been derived. Our work suggests that calculations of mortality can be useful in comparative treatment planning. Such mortality calculations can be helpful to find decisions between radiotherapy treatment techniques (intensity modulated or conventional treatment) or between different types of radiation (photons, electrons, protons, neutrons)

Therefore, X-ray scatter and neutron radiation as well as the impact of the primary dose distribution on secondary cancer incidence are analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential and a plateau dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 30 patients who received radiation therapy of prostate cancer. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used in eleven patients, another eleven patients received IMRT with 6-MV photons, and eight patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. The treatment plans were recalculated with 15-MV and 18-MV photons. Secondary cancer risk was estimated based on the OED for the different treatment techniques. RESULTS: A modest increase of 15% radiation-induced cancer results from IMRT using low energies (6 MV), compared to conventional four-field planning with 15-MV photons (plateau dose-response: 1%). The probability to develop a secondary cancer increases with IMRT of higher energies by 20% and 60% for 15 MV and 18 MV, respectively (plateau dose-response: 2% and 30%). The use of spot-scanned protons can reduce secondary cancer incidence as much as 50% (independent of dose-response). CONCLUSION: By including the primary dose distribution into the analysis of radiation-induced cancer incidence, the resulting increase in risk for secondary cancer using modern treatment techniques such as IMRT is not as dramatic as expected from earlier studies. By using 6-MV photons, only a moderate risk increase is expected. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice in regard to secondary cancer incidence

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential, a plateau, and a linear dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 23 patients who received RT of prostate cancer. Conformal RT was used in 7 patients, 8 patients received IMRT with 6- and 15-MV photons, and 8 patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. We applied target doses ranging from 70 Gy to 100 Gy. Cancer risk was estimated as a function of target dose and tumor control probability. RESULTS: At a 100-Gy target dose the secondary cancer risk relative to the 3D treatment plan at 70 Gy was +18.4% (15.0% for a plateau model, 22.3% for a linear model) for the 6-MV IMRT plan, +25.3% (17.0%, 14.1%) for the 15-MV IMRT plan, and -40.7% (-41.3%, -40.0%) for the spot-scanned protons. The increasing risk of developing a radiation-associated malignancy after RT with increasing dose was balanced by the enhanced cure rates at a larger dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk after dose escalation for prostate RT is expected to be equal to or lower than for conventional 3D treatment at 70 Gy, independent of treatment modality or dose-response model. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice for dose escalation because this therapy can halve the risk of secondary cancers

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed analyzing all patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas who received radiotherapy through the University of California San Francisco and at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory between 1977 and 1987, a total of 62 patients. University of California San Francisco patients received photon therapy (median dose 5400 cGy), and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory patients were treated with the charged particles helium and/or neon (median dose 6000 cGyE). Forty-eight patients were treated post-operatively with curative intent, 30 with photons and 18 with particles. Thirty-six patients in the study had gross residual disease; none had microscopically negative margins. RESULTS: The overall two-year actuarial survival was 28%: 44% for particle-treated patients and 18% for patients treated with photons (p = .048). Median actuarial survival was 23 months in particle patients and 12 months in photon patients. Local control was also improved, though less significantly, in patients treated with particles (median disease-free survival 20 months vs. 4.5 months, p = .054). A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed and revealed that only extent of residual disease predicted local failure and overall survival; no other prognostic factors were identified. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional photon radiotherapy, treatment with post-operative charged particle irradiation at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory appeared to offer a survival advantage in this non-randomized series. Additional investigation into protection of surrounding normal tissue with better dose localization through the use of charged particles is planned

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bile duct carcinomas are notoriously difficult to cure, with locoregional recurrence the rule, even after radical resection. Adjuvant efforts have included various radiation modalities, with limited success. Recently, charged-particle radiotherapy has also been used in these patients. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis of 129 patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas treated between 1977 and 1987 through the University of California at San Francisco, including 22 patients treated at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with the charged particles helium and neon. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Survival, outcome, and complication results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were treated with surgery alone (S), 45 patients received conventional adjuvant x-ray radiotherapy (S + X), and 22 were treated with charged particles (S + CP). The median survival times were 6.5, 11, and 14 months, respectively, for the entire group, and 16, 16, and 23 months in patients treated with curative intent. There was a survival difference in patients undergoing total resection compared with debulking (p = 0.05) and minor resections (p = 0.0001). Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant irradiation, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional X (p = 0.0109). Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after irradiatio CONCLUSIONS: The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease

To evaluate the applicability and technical performance of a commercial 3D surface imaging system for repositioning of breast cancer patients, measurements were performed in a rigid anthropomorphic phantom as well as in healthy volunteers. The camera system records a respiration-gated surface model of the imaged object, which may be registered to a previously recorded reference model. A transformation is provided, which may be applied to the treatment couch to correct the setup of the patient. The system showed a high stability and detected pre-defined shifts of phantoms and healthy volunteers with an accuracy of 0.40 +/- 0.26 mm and 1.02 +/- 0.51 mm, respectively (spatial deviation between pre-defined shift and suggested correction). The accuracy of the suggested rotational correction around the vertical axis was always better than 0.3 degrees in phantom measurements and 0.8 degrees in volunteers, respectively. Comparison of the suggested setup correction with that detected by a second and independently operated marker-based optical system provided consistent results. The results demonstrate that the camera system provides highly accurate setup corrections in a phantom and healthy volunteers. The most efficient use of the system for improving the setup accuracy in breast cancer patients has to be investigated in routine patient treatments	
0	1659	Direct evidence for the spatial correlation between individual particle traversals and localized CDKN1A (p21) response induced by high-LET radiation	Bystander Effect, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, Cyclins/ph [Physiology], Cyclins/re [Radiation Effects], DNA Damage, Fibroblasts, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Radiation	The spatial correlation between individual particle traversals and the nuclear CDKN1A (p21) response after high-LET irradiation of human fibroblasts was investigated. The experiments were based on a technique for the retrospective detection of particle traversals by means of nuclear track detectors, which were used as the cell substratum. This technique requires the precise repositioning of a sample at different steps of the experimental procedure and uses a computerized microscope stage control. The precision of the spatial correlation is further enhanced by means of reference marks in the track etch material that are produced by preirradiation of the plates with charged-particle beams at low fluences. The pattern of the CDKN1A foci that were induced by charged-particle traversals at 1 h postirradiation was found to coincide extremely well with the pattern of particle tracks. This represents direct evidence that CDKN1A foci are located at the sites of particle traversals and thus provides further evidence that the radiation-induced accumulation of the CDKN1A protein takes place at the sites of the primary damage

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Amifostine was given as daily intravenous application (500 mg) 10 to 15 minutes prior to radiotherapy in 20 patients. The results were compared with another collective of patients which was similar. RESULTS: According to the WHO score mucositis became manifest in 10 patients (Grade I) and 4 patients (Grade II) in the amifostine group vs 9 patients (Grade II), 6 patients (Grade III) and 1 patient (Grade IV) in the control group. Xerostomia has been seen in 15 patients (Grade I) and 5 patients (Grade II) after administration of amifostine. Without the drug 2 patients suffered from xerostomia (Grade I), 8 patients (Grade II) and 8 patients (Grade III), respectively. Administering amifostine had been feasible and non problematic. Only a small rate of toxic side effects like nausea (11%) or emesis (4%) was documented. CONCLUSIONS: Amifostine is an effective radioprotector decreasing acute and late side effects in patients with head and neck tumors

All 16 volunteers suspect exposures to depleted uranium (DU) while deployed at the two different theatres of war in 1990 and later on. The Bremen laboratory control served as a reference in this study. Compared with this control there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of dicentric chromosomes (dic) and centric ring chromosomes (cR) in the veterans' group. indicating a previous exposure to ionising radiation. The statistically significant overdispersion of die and cR indicates non-uniform irradiation as would be expected after non-uniform exposure and/or exposure to radiation with a high linear energy transfer (LET). The frequency of SCEs was decreased when compared with the laboratory control

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two optical displacement sensors, placed close to the patient's head, were used for online monitoring of the head position, with submillimeter accuracy. Motion data, including the difference between start and end position (Dx) and the maximum displacement during the recorded session (Dx-max), were acquired for pretreatment sessions to analyze alignment radiographs, and for treatment sessions. We have recorded 102 pretreatment and 99 treatment sessions in 16 patients immobilized with a thermoplastic mask, and 44 pretreatment and 56 treatment sessions in 13 patients immobilized with vacuum-assisted dental fixation. To avoid incorrect data analysis due to replicate observations, only 1 pretreatment and 1 treatment session per patient were selected at random for statistical comparison of mean or median motion parameters in different subgroups. RESULTS: Both techniques showed similar immobilization efficiencies. The median Dx and Dx-max values were 0. 18 mm and 0.46 mm, respectively, for 16 treatment sessions with mask immobilization, and 0.22 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively, for 13 treatment sessions with dental immobilization. Motion parameters for pretreatment and treatment sessions were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Online verification of patient's head motion is feasible and provides valuable data for confirmation of proper treatment delivery in individual patients, as well as for the evaluation of different immobilization methods	
1	2112	Value and perspectives of proton radiation therapy for limited stage prostate cancer	Dose Fractionation, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: This review article will focus on clinical results and limitations of proton beam irradiation. Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects

In clinically organ-confined prostate cancer, it may be possible, in principle, to further improve outcomes by reducing the margins of the high-dose planning target volume to the gross tumor volume and by covering the clinical target volume with a dose sufficient to control microscopic extensions of the tumor. This would allow further dose escalation without increasing the risk of acute and late effects. In this paper, we undertake a careful review of existing histopathological data that support this view and discuss technical possibilities to this approach utilizing the highly conformal characteristics of proton beams and combining them with modern 4D imaging and treatment techniques.

Targeting of the tumor and avoidance of critical structures within the patient have to be both accurate and precise to achieve the desired therapeutic results. Good understanding of proton radiation delivery and patient alignment concepts in the treatment room is essential to achieve this goal. This overview article presents treatment room concepts that will ensure precise proton beam delivery and, at the same time, guarantee an efficient patient throughput. Concepts discussed include effective patient immobilization, image-guided alignment verification, appropriate training of radiotherapists, and the physician's integrative role in understanding the complex spatial relationships between tumor, organs at risk, treatment beam configuration, and application of proton radiation dose. It will be demonstrated that in addition to the technical armamentarium, now commonplace in modern radiation oncology departments, the interaction between radiation oncologist, medical physicist and radiotherapist is important for efficient operation of a proton treatment facility	
1	1467	Acute radiation-induced toxicity of heavy ion radiotherapy delivered with intensity modulated pencil beam scanning in patients with base of skull tumors	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Erythema/et [Etiology], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Ions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Mastoiditis/et [Etiology], Middle Aged, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sinusitis/et [Etiology], Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stereotaxic Techniques	PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate acute radiation-induced toxicity of carbon ion therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 1997 to November 2000, 37 patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ions at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at GSI, Darmstadt. Tumor-conformal application of carbon beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning in combination with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. The treatment planning procedure included a biological plan optimization. We applied a cobalt-Gray equivalent dose of 60GyE. Acute toxicity was assessed according to the common toxicity criteria (CTC). RESULTS: Acute toxicity included skin reactions ( degrees I+ degrees II) in four patients, mucositis ( degrees I- degrees III) in eight patients, otitis and middle ear effusion in four, sinusitis in four, nausea/weight loss in one and edema of the temporal lobes in one patient. In two patients, preexisting neurological symptoms worsened. We did not observe acute morbidity > degrees III of normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Scanning beam delivery of heavy charged particles is safe and reliable. No unexpected acute dose limiting toxicity was observed. With regard to toxicity, a substantial improvement compared to passive beam shaping technology is achieved

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August 1998 and December 2000, 37 patients with chordomas (n = 24) and chondrosarcomas (n = 13) were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy within a Phase I/II trial. Tumor conformal application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included biologic plan optimization. The median tumor dose was 60 GyE (GyE = Gy x relative biologic effectiveness). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 13 months. The local control rate after 1 and 2 years was 96% and 90%, respectively. We observed 2 recurrences outside the gross tumor volume in patients with chordomas. Progression-free survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 83% for chordomas at 2 years. Partial remission after carbon ion radiotherapy was observed in 6 patients. Treatment toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: These are the first data demonstrating the clinical feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of scanning beam delivery of ion beams in patients with skull base tumors. The preliminary results in patients with skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas are encouraging, although the follow-up was too short to draw definite conclusions concerning outcome. In the absence of major toxicity, dose escalation might be considered

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and December 2001, 74 patients were treated for chordomas and chondrosarcomas with carbon ion RT at the "Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung" (GSI). Seven patients reirradiated with reduced carbon ion doses after conventional RT were excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 evaluable patients (44 chordomas and 23 chondrosarcomas) who received a full course of carbon ion therapy. Tumor-conform application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with active energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included intensity modulation and biological plan optimization. A median dose of 60 GyE was applied to the target volume within 20 consecutive days at a dose of 3.0 GyE per fraction. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-46 months). At 3 years, actuarial local control was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 87% for chordomas, respectively. Partial tumor remission was observed in 14/44 (31%) chordoma patients and in 4/23 (17%) chondrosarcoma patients. At 3 years, actuarial overall survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 89% for chordomas, respectively. No severe side effects > CTC degrees III have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the clinical efficiency and safety of scanning beam delivery of carbon ion beams in patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. The observation of tumor regressions at a dose level of 60 GyE may indicate that the biological effectiveness of carbon ions in chordomas and chondrosarcomas is higher than initially estimated

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment	
1	1317	Optimization of radiation therapy for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas with infiltration of the skull base using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a carbon ion boost	Carbon, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Ethmoid Sinus, Germany, Humans, Ions, Jaw Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lead, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

Patient treatments within the pilot project are carried out by radiation oncologists of the University of Heidelberg in cooperation with the Department of Biophysics of GSI, the Division of Medical Physics of the German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg and the Research Center Rossendorf. Patients are treated within three beam time blocks of 20 days per year at the basic physics research center at GSI, the overall capacity per year being 45 to 50 patients. Main purpose of the pilot project was to investigate carbon ion radiation therapy for different tumor entities within clinical phase I/II trials.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and December 2002, 152 patients were treated at GSI with carbon ion RT. Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions. RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control was 81% for chordomas, 100% for chondrosarcomas, and 62% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas	
1	721	Therapy strategies for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas using modern radiation therapy techniques	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Germany, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Orbital Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated whether modern photon techniques, such as stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy (FSRT) or intensity-modulated RT, outweighed the biologic advantages of high-linear-energy transfer RT in the treatment of patients with locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) that infiltrated the skull base or the orbit. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5% and 77.5% for Group A and 72.2% and 24.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5%/53% and 86.6%/75.8% for Group A and 69.2%/23% and 77.9%/77.9% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2). Grade 3 late toxicity occurred in 1 patient (1.9%) only. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT is an effective treatment for low- and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base offering high local control rates with low toxicity

Mode of action and problems are discussed and published results reported. Human tumour cells obtained of biopsies from our patients before the onset of treatments were investigated. The short time cell cultures were treated either with hyperthermia or irradiation alone or with combinations under the same conditions as the clinical treatments. We could clearly demonstrate that cell cultures of human origin respond to irradiation or hyperthermia. But the effect was limited and only cultures treated with combined modalities did not relapse. There is hope that mega-voltage radiation complemented with hyperthermia have a similar effect as high-LET-radiation. Side effects have been moderate so far using an extended clinical use

The coordinates of specific target landmarks, i.e., bone, calcium deposition or catheters, on baseline CT scans were compared with those measured on control scans. Since the PLATO-SRS system yields 3 coordinates for each target, the final error is calculated by the evaluation of the shift of the different coordinates. The mean error reported for the first material (ORFIT) was 5 mm (13/23 patients). This margin of error is too high and was considered unacceptable; a second material was then tested. The latter, which is not recyclable and softens at higher temperatures, exhibited a mean error of 2.5 mm (10/23 patients), which allows daily repositioning of greater reliability. Treatment was repeated in 4/20 arcs in all, which number depended mainly on fraction size. Correct lesion location and patient positioning were allowed by laser landmarks on the mask made directly on the treatment couch. The laser too was checked before each treatment session, i.e., preferentially at the end of an ordinary working day	
1	1562	An optimization algorithm that incorporates IMRT delivery constraints	Algorithms, Head, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Research, Risk	An intensity-modulated beam optimization algorithm is presented which incorporates the delivery constraints into the optimization cycle. The optimization algorithm is based on the quasi-Newton method of iteratively solving minimization problems. The developed algorithm iteratively corrects the incident, pencil-beam-like, fluence to incorporate the delivery constraints. In the present study, the goal of the optimization algorithm is to achieve the best deliverable radiotherapy plan, subject to the constraints of the delivery technique described by a leaf-sequencing algorithm being applied concurrently. In general, if they are applied after, rather than during, the optimization cycle, the delivery constraints associated with the IMRT technique can produce local variations up to 6% in the 'optimized' dose (i.e., distribution without applied constraints) and reduce the degree of conformity, of the dose, to the PTV region. The optimization method has been applied to three IMRT delivery techniques: dynamic multileaf (DMLC), multiple-static-field (MSF) and slice-by-slice tomotherapy (NOMOS MIMiC). The beam profiles were generated for a prostate tumour with organs at risk being the rectum, bladder and femoral heads. The optimization method described was shown to generate optimum and deliverable IMRT plans for these three delivery techniques. In the case of the DMLC and MSF the optimization converged within 3-5 iterations to a mean PTV dose of 69.60 +/- 1.34 Gy and 69.71 +/- 1.34 Gy, respectively, while for NOMOS MIMiC approximately 10 iterations were needed to obtain 69.68 +/- 1.55 Gy. In addition to this, the IMRT optimization also yielded optimum fluence profiles when clustering was performed concurrently with the leaf-sequencer. An optimum between 8 and 15 clusters of equal fluence 'intensity' was shown to establish the best compromise between the number of fluence levels and the PTV dose coverage	
1	391	Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units	Dose Fractionation, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Supine Position	Interplay between organ (breathing) motion and leaf motion has been shown in the literature to have a small dosimetric impact for clinical conditions (over a 30 fraction treatment). However, previous studies did not consider the case of treatment beams made up of many few-monitor-unit (MU) segments, where the segment delivery time (1-2 s) is of the order of the breathing period (3-5 s). In this study we assess if breathing compromises the radiotherapy treatment with IMRT segments of low number of MUs. We assess (i) how delivered dose varies, from patient to patient, with the number of MU per segment, (ii) if this delivered dose is identical to the average dose calculated without motion over the path of the motion, and (iii) the impact of the daily variation of the delivered dose as a function of MU per segment. The organ motion was studied along two orthogonal directions, representing the left-right and cranial-caudal directions of organ movement for a patient setup in the supine position. Breathing motion was modeled as sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x), based on functions used in the literature to represent organ motion. Measurements were performed with an ionization chamber and films. For a systematic study of motion effects, a MATLAB simulation was written to model organ movement and dose delivery. In the case of a single beam made up of one single segment, the dose delivered to point in a moving target over 30 fractions can vary up to 20% and 10% for segments of 10 MU and 20 MU, respectively. This dose error occurs because the tumor spends most of the time near the edges of the radiation beam. In the case of a single beam made of multiple segments with low MU, we observed 2.4%, 3.3%, and 4.3% differences, respectively, for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion, between delivered dose and motion-averaged dose for points in the penumbra region of the beam and over 30 fractions. In approximately 5-10% of the cases, differences between the motion-averaged dose and the delivered 30-fraction dose could reach 6%, 8% and 10-12%, respectively for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion. To analyze a clinical IMRT beam, two patient plans were randomly selected. For one of the patients, the beams showed a likelihood of up to 25.6% that the delivered dose would deviate from the motion-averaged dose by more than 1%. For the second patient, there was a likelihood of up to 62.8% of delivering a dose that differs by more than 1% from the motion-averaged dose and a likelihood of up to approximately 30% for a 2% dose error. For the entire five-beam IMRT plan, statistical averaging over the beams reduces the overall dose error between the delivered dose and the motion-averaged dose. For both patients there was a likelihood of up to 7.0% and 33.9% that the dose error was greater than 1%, respectively. For one of the patients, there was a 12.6% likelihood of a 2% dose error. Daily intrafraction variation of the delivered dose of more than 10% is non-negligible and can potentially lead to biological effects. We observed [for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x)] that below 10-15 MU leads to large daily variations of the order of 15-35%. Therefore, for small MU segments, non-negligible biological effects can be incurred. We conclude that for most clinical cases the effects may be small because of the use of many beams, it is desirable to avoid low-MU segments when treating moving targets. In addition, dose averaging may not work well for hypo-fractionation, where fewer fractions are used. For hypo-fractionation, PDF modeling of the tumor motion in IMRT optimization may not be adequate

The following variables were predictive of melanoma-related deaths. Treatment: rate ratio (ratio of the rate of death for one category of the variable relative to the rate of death for another category) of 6.32 (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 23.51) for enucleation group 1 vs proton beam, 3.06 (0.81 to 11.54) for enucleation group 2 vs proton beam, and 2.07 (1.05 to 4.07) for enucleation group 1 vs enucleation group 2. Size: rate ratio of 3.61 (1.51 to 8.64) for large (16+ mm) vs small (less than 11 mm) tumors. Location: rate ratio of 3.19 (1.56 to 6.53) for tumors anterior vs posterior to the equator. When death from all causes was evaluated as the outcome, the estimated rate ratios were similar. When melanoma metastasis was evaluated as the outcome, the estimated rate ratios were reduced in magnitude

Analysis involved Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards analysis with visual outcome defined as worse than 20/200. Prognostic factors were tumor height: rate ratio (ratio of rate of visual loss for one category of the variable relative to the rate of visual loss for a reference category of that variable) of 5.26 (95% confidence interval, 2.66-10.39) for tumors greater than 5 mm compared to tumors 3.0 mm or less in height; distance of tumor from the optic disc and fovea: rate ratio 2.59 (1.63-4.11) for tumors 2DD or less from both the optic disc and fovea compared to those greater than 2 DD from these structures. Also predictive of visual loss were tumor location close to disc only, or close to fovea only, macular detachment, worse pretreatment vision, and higher radiation doses delivered to both the disc and fovea, and lens. Regression analysis using a visual acuity scale gave similar results

Of 562 eyes treated over a 10-year period with pretreatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better, 363 (64.6%) contained tumors within 2 disc diameters (DD) of the disc or fovea. Rates of visual loss after treatment to worse than 20/200 and causes of visual decline were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cumulative rates of visual loss among subjects with tumors near the disc or fovea were 33 and 47% 1 and 2 years after treatment compared to 17 and 28%, respectively, for subjects with tumors located farther from both structures. The leading cause of visual loss in the first year among eyes with tumors near the disc or fovea was retinal detachment. Controlling for other predictors of visual loss to worse than 20/200, location near the disc or fovea was independently related to visual loss primarily due to retinal detachment, cataract, and radiation retinopathy. Despite the unfavorable location of these tumors, over half of patients with 20/200 or better pretreatment visual acuity had useful vision 2 years after treatment

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma

After therapy they increased slowly. 3 months after irradiation the average immunoglobulin levels showed a reduction of 16%. After substitution of immunoglobulins no decrease of the levels was seen. After substitution of immunoglobulins the Karnofsky index was significantly higher. Substituted patients showed a lower rate of radiation pneumonitis

Radiosurgery was chosen as an alternative treatment, either because the AVM was considered to be of high surgical risk due to its size and/or location, or because the patient refused surgery. In 63 patients (92.6%), complete clinical and radiological follow-up examinations were available. Clinical and radiological long-term results were correlated to size and to the Spetzler-Martin scale of the AVM. With increasing size or higher grade on the Spetzler-Martin scale, the clinical results of proton beam therapy became progressively worse. Of 37 patients with an AVM between 3 and 6 cm in diameter, only one-third showed amelioration of their clinical symptoms, and two-thirds remained the same or even deteriorated after radiation treatment. The same results apply to patients with very large AVM's, of whom only one-third profited from proton beam therapy. Although 85.7% of the patients in Spetzler-Martin Grades I and II showed postirradiation amelioration of their clinical symptoms, this compares to only 54.2% of the patients in Grade III, and only 24% in Grade IV. In regard to the radiological results of proton beam therapy, complete obliteration during long-term observation was only detectable in 10 patients or 15.9%, which is less than one-sixth of the whole group of 63 patients. All of these obliterated AVM's were smaller than 3 cm. Almost 85% of the patients treated using stereotactic proton beam therapy did not show any angiographic change in the radiological appearance of their AVM. The results reported here indicate that radiosurgery using stereotactic proton beam therapy is ineffective for the treatment of medium- or large-sized AVM's and should not be recommended for patients harboring an AVM larger than 3 cm. If proton beam treatment is contemplated, it should be restricted to AVM's that are less than 3 cm in size and whose location makes them easily accessible only for proton beam therapy

We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone

METHODS: Modern skull base surgical techniques were used in all patients who were treated between August 1991 and July 2000. The degree of tumor resection was gauged according to intraoperative inspection and postoperative high-resolution imaging findings. There were 21 patients with primary disease and eight with recurrent disease. Total resection was accomplished in 18 patients. Five patients had undergone radiotherapy prior to the present surgery, and an additional eight patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. There were no surgery-related deaths. In five patients who died of the disease, surgery and radiotherapy had failed to effect a cure. Two of the remaining patients are alive with recurrent disease, and there is questionable evidence of recurrence in another patient. All 24 patients are functioning independently. Cranial nerve impairment was the most common postoperative deficit, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull base techniques in radical surgery provides an opportunity to excise the tumor and the involved bone. In most cases the procedure-related cranial nerve deficits improve over time. The complications of CSF leakage and infection can be minimized and are preventable.

The system comprises a compact diagnostic X-ray unit mounted on the accelerator head, with its source in the isocentric plane exactly 37 degrees around from the therapy source. The image detector is an image intensifier with digital image storage/processing facilities. Images were taken at the accelerator of treatment fields in seven patients (pelvic, head and neck, chest fields) and these images were comparable in anatomical contrast to simulator radiographs. Two techniques for marking the therapy field onto the portal images were successfully demonstrated. One was to mark relevant corners or edges of the therapy light field on the skin using small Pb markers which become clearly visible in the 'diagnostic' portal image. The other was to record a separate 'therapy' image and through the software, extract and superimpose the field edges on to the 'diagnostic' image. The system and method proved fundamentally sound on criteria of image quality, geometric precision of rotation between therapy and imaging conditions, and its potential for development as a practical clinical tool	
1	4057	Comparison of proton and x-ray conformal dose distributions for radiosurgery applications	Biophysics, Boston, Brain, Humans, Massachusetts, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Technology,Radiologic, X-Rays	Highly focused dose distributions for radiosurgery applications are successfully achieved using either multiple static high-energy particle beams or multiple-arc circular x-ray beams from a linac. It has been suggested that conformal x-ray techniques using dynamically shaped beams with a moving radiation source would offer advantages compared to the use of only circular beams. It is also thought that, generally, charged particle beams such as protons offer dose deposition advantages compared to x-ray beams. A comparison of dose distributions was made between a small number of discrete proton beams, multiple-arc circular x-ray beams, and conformal x-ray techniques. Treatment planning of a selection of radiosurgery cases was done for these three techniques. Target volumes ranged from 1.0-25.0 cm3. Dose distributions and dose volume histograms of the target and surrounding normal brain were calculated. The advantages and limitations of each technique were primarily dependent upon the shape and size of the target volume. In general, proton dose distributions were superior to x-ray distributions; both shaped proton and shaped x-ray beams delivered dose distributions which were more conformal than x-ray techniques using circular beams; and the differences between all proton and x-ray distributions were negligible for the smallest target volumes, and greatest for the larger target volumes

The standard assay involved incubating 2 X 10(5) lymphocytes per test well for 72 hours in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). The results showed that there was a significant decrease in lymphocyte responsiveness of former thorium workers grouped by decade of life when compared with controls of the same decade of life for each mitogen tested with the exceptions of PHA in the 41-50 age group and PWM in the 51-60 age group. We are unable to correlate the decreased response observed with the measured body burdens, external gamma exposure, or thoron exhalation rates in these thorium cases. However, other occupational exposures (i.e., various chemicals used in processing thorium) cannot be eliminated as a possible cause

0	2116	Pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of an alpha-particle emitter labeled antibody: 213Bi-HuM195 (anti-CD33) in patients with leukemia.[see comment]	Acute Disease, Alpha Particles, Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Bismuth, Energy Transfer, Gamma Cameras, Half-Life, Humans, Leukemia,Myeloid/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Leukemia,Myeloid/rt [Radiotherapy], Linear Energy Transfer, Liver, Mice, Photons, Physics, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research	Data from nine patients with leukemia participating in a phase I activity-escalation study of HuM195, labeled with the alpha-particle emitter 213Bi (half-life = 45.6 min), were used to estimate pharmacokinetics and dosimetry. This is the first trial using an alpha-particle emitter in humans. The linear energy transfer of alpha particles is several hundredfold greater than that of beta emissions. The range in tissue is approximately 60-90 microm. METHODS: The activity administered to patients ranged from 0.6 to 1.6 GBq. Patient imaging was initiated at the start of each injection. Thirty 1-min images followed by ten 3-min images were collected in dynamic mode; a 20% photopeak window centered at 440 keV was used. Blood samples were collected until 3 h postinjection and counted in a gamma counter. Contours around the liver and spleen were drawn on the anterior and posterior views and around a portion of the spine on the posterior views. No other organs were visualized. RESULTS: The percentage injected dose in the liver and spleen volumes increased rapidly over the first 10-15 min to a constant value for the remaining hour of imaging, yielding a very rapid uptake followed by a plateau in the antibody uptake curves. The kinetic curves were integrated to yield cumulated activity. The mean energy emitted per nuclear transition for 213Bi and its daughters, adjusted by a relative biologic effectiveness of 5 for alpha emissions, was multiplied by the cumulated activity to yield the absorbed dose equivalent. Photon dose to the total body was determined by calculating a photon-absorbed fraction. The absorbed dose equivalent to liver and spleen volumes ranged from 2.4 to 11.2 and 2.9 to 21.9 Sv, respectively. Marrow (or leukemia) mean dose ranged from 6.6 to 12.2 Sv. The total-body dose (photons only) ranged from 2.2 x 10(-4) to 5.8 x 10(-4) Gy. CONCLUSION: This study shows that patient imaging of 213Bi, an alpha-particle emitter, labeled to HuM195 is possible and may be used to derive pharmacokinetics and dosimetry. The absorbed dose ratio between marrow, liver and spleen volumes and the whole body for 213Bi-HuM195 is 1000-fold greater than that commonly observed with beta-emitting radionuclides used for radioimmunotherapy

Twenty-eight of them received radiotherapy with 32 MeV Betatron and intracavitary radium. Twenty-one patients with Stage IB or IIA had a radical hysterectomy, five had post-operative pelvic irradiation, and two had primary exenteration. An overall 23.2% of patients had metastases in the paraaortic fields. Four patients with paraaortic node disease received extended field irradiation: 4500 rad in 5 weeks to paraaortic nodes. Two of them are alive and disease-free at 5.5 to 6.5 years

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients between 1990 and 2005 with the diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancer was performed. Of 125 total patients new onset urothelial carcinoma developed in 11 after undergoing external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy with a proton boost to the prostate was the radiation modality in 7 of the 11 patients (64%), while the remaining 4 patients received standard external beam radiation only. Urothelial carcinoma was detected a mean of 3.07 years after completion of radiation therapy in the proton group, compared to a mean latency period of 5.75 years in the standard radiation group (p = 0.09). Average patient age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 64 to 84). All patients presented with gross hematuria and had cystoscopic findings of coexisting radiation cystitis. Of the 11 patients 5 (45%) presented with grade 3 carcinoma and eventually 7 (64%) required radical cystectomy. Urothelial tumors with sarcomatoid features (carcinosarcoma and spindle cell sarcomatoid) developed in 2 patients (18%). Of the 11 patients 10 (91%) were nonsmokers at the time of urothelial carcinoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma in patients with previous radiation therapy for prostate cancer is often high grade, and the majority of patients have cancer progression requiring cystectomy. A high incidence of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features was seen in these patients	
1	4712	Use of peripheral dose data from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation fields to estimate out-of-field organ dose in patients treated employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy	Head, Humans, India, Indium, Jaw, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Scattering,Radiation, Time, Water, Whole-Body Counting, X-Rays	Peripheral doses (PD) from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) fields were measured for 6 MV x-rays on a Varian linear accelerator using a 0.6 cc ionization chamber inserted at 5 cm depth into a 35 x 35 x 105 cm3 plastic water phantom. PD measurements were also carried out under identical conditions for seven patients treated for head and neck and cervical cancer employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The measured PD from these patient-specific intensity-modulated beams (IMBs) were compared with the corresponding data from uniform DMLC fields having similar jaws setting. The measured PD per monitor unit (PD/MU) decreases almost exponentially with out-of-field distance for all uniform DMLC and static fields. For the same strip field width of 1.2 cm, uniform DMLC fields with a larger size of 14 x 22 cm2 deliver an average of 3.51 (SD = 0.51) times higher PD/MU at all out-of-field distances compared to 6 x 6 cm2. Similar to uniform DMLC fields, PD/MU measured from different patient-specific IMBs was found to decrease almost exponentially with out-of-field distance and increase with increase in field dimension. PD per MU from uniform DMLC fields and patient-specific IMBs having similar jaws setting shows good agreement (+/-7%) except at the most proximal distance, where a variation of more than 10% (maximum 15%) was observed. Our study shows that PD data generated from uniform DMLC fields can be used as baseline data to estimate out-of-field critical organ or whole-body dose in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT if an appropriate correction factor for field dimension is applied. The whole-body dose information can be used to estimate the possible increase in risk of fatal secondary malignancy in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT

To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

As examples of such contribution, radiobiologically-elaborated continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) has been proven to be superior to conventional radiotherapy against non-small cell lung cancer, and a hypoxic cell sensitizer nimorazole has been proven to be effective against pharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal cancers. Based on laboratory studies, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone in many cancers. Radiation biology has also provided important fundamental data for clinical applications of heavy ion and proton beam therapy. In the future, useful predictive assays and radioprotectors are also expected to be developed. Radiation biology should continue to contribute to the further development of clinical radiation therapy. [References: 13]

The aims of the survey included the following: present status of radiation treatment facilities, equipment, personnel, patient loads, and other factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A mail survey verified each potential facility delivering megavoltage radiation therapy and collected data on treatment devices, other equipment, personnel, new patients, and so on. Responses were obtained from 100% of potential facilities. RESULTS: A total of 726 facilities delivered radiation therapy, with 859 megavoltage devices, 203 RALS (remote after-loading system) and other radioactive sources, with 941 FTE (full-time employee) radiation oncologists including 369 FTE Japanese Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology-certified radiation oncologists, 1555 FTE radiation therapists, and 70 FTE physicists in 2003. Megavoltage devices included two heavy ion units and four proton units. In total, there were 149,793 new patients and 146,351 (98%) by external irradiation; 4379 (3%) were treated by brachytherapy with or without external irradiation. Eighty-six percent of the facilities had treatment-planning computers, but 4% had no treatment-planning capability. Six percent (44 facilities) of all facilities used hyperthermia, 12% (85 facilities) intraoperative radiation therapy, and 2% (12 facilities) intensity-modulated radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Facilities surveys continue to provide a source of census data on radiation oncology in Japan, allowing comparisons among facility groups and over time

One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

We investigated the three-dimensional movement of lung tumors through an inserted internal marker using a real-time tumor-tracking system and evaluated the efficacy of this system at reducing the internal margin. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four patients with lung cancer were analyzed. A 2.0-mm gold marker was inserted into the tumor. The real-time tumor-tracking system calculates and stores three-dimensional coordinates of the marker 30 times/s. The system can trigger the linear accelerator to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the predetermined "permitted dislocation." The value was set at +/-1 to +/-3 mm according to the patient's characteristics. We analyzed 10,413-14,893 data sets for each of the 4 patients. The range of marker movement during normal breathing (beam-off period) was compared with that during gated irradiation (beam-on period) by Student's t test. RESULTS: The range of marker movement during the beam-off period was 5.5-10.0 mm in the lateral direction (x), 6.8-15.9 mm in the craniocaudal direction (y) and 8.1-14.6 mm in the ventrodorsal direction (z). The range during the beam-on period was reduced to within 5.3 mm in all directions in all 4 patients. A significant difference was found between the mean of the range during the beam-off period and the mean of the range during the beam-on period in the x (p = 0.007), y (p = 0.025), and z (p = 0.002) coordinates, respectively. CONCLUSION: The real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system was useful to analyze the movement of an internal marker. Treatment with megavoltage X-rays was properly given when the tumor marker moved into the "permitted dislocation" zone from the planned position

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 51 NSCLC patients were treated with proton beams at the University of Tsukuba. There were 28 patients in Stage I, 9 in Stage II, 8 in Stage III, 1 in Stage IV, and 5 with recurrent disease. Thirty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 17 had adenocarcinoma, and 1 had large-cell carcinoma. Median fraction and total doses given were 3.0 Gy (range 2.0-6.0 Gy), and 76.0 Gy (range 49.0-93.0 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 29% for all patients, 70% for 9 Stage IA patients, and 16% for 19 Stage IB patients, respectively (IA vs. IB: p < 0.05). The 5-year in-field local control rate was higher in patients with Stage IA (89%) when compared with those with Stage IB (39%). Forty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute lung toxicity of Grade 1 or less; 3 had Grade 2, 1 had Grade 3, and none experienced Grade 4 or higher. Patients in the present series showed very little late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is a very safe and effective treatment for patients with NSCLC, especially for those with early stages. The relative merit of proton therapy in comparison with stereotactic photon radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy remains to be defined through future clinical trials

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

Patient outcome following standard dose radiotherapy or following a 12.5% increase in total dose to 75.6 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) using a conformal perineal proton boost was compared for local tumor control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stage T3-T4, Nx, N0-2, M0 patients received 50.4 Gy by four-field photons and were randomized to receive either an additional 25.2 CGE by conformal protons (arm 1--the high dose arm, 103 patients, total dose 75.6 CGE) or an additional 16.8 Gy by photons (arm 2--the conventional dose arm, 99 patients, total dose 67.2 Gy). Actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), total recurrence-free survival (TRFS), (clinically free, prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 4ng/ml and a negative prostate rebiopsy, done in 38 patients without evidence of disease) and local control (digital rectal exam and rebiopsy negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 90% for arm 1 and 97% for arm 2. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range 3 to 139 months) 135 patients are alive and 67 have died, 20 from causes other than prostate cancer. We found no significant differences in OS, DSS, TRFS or local control between the two arms. Among those completing randomized treatment (93 in arm 1 and 96 in arm 2), the local control at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 92% and 77%, respectively and is 80% and 60%, respectively for arm 2 (p = .089) and there are no significant differences in OS, DSS, and TRFS. The local control for the 57 patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason 4 or 5 of 5) tumors at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 94% and 84% and is 64% and 19% on arm 2 (p = 0.0014). In patients whose digital rectal exam had normalized following treatment and underwent prostate rebiopsy there was a lower positive rebiopsy rate for arm 1 versus arm 2 patients (28 vs. 45%) and also for those with well and moderately differentiated tumors versus poorly differentiated tumors (32 and 50%). These differences were not statistically significant. Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding is higher (32 vs. 12%, p = 0.002) as may be urethral stricture (19 vs. 8%, p = 0.07) in the arm 1 versus arm 2. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in prostate tumor dose by external beam of 12.5% to 75.6 CGE by a conformal proton boost compared to a conventional dose of 67.2 Gy by a photon boost significantly improved local control only in patients with poorly differentiated tumors. It has increased late radiation sequelae, and as yet, has not increased overall survival, disease-specific survival, or total recurrence-free survival in any subgroup. These results have led us to test by a subsequent Phase III trial the potential beneficial effect on local control and disease-specific survival of a 12.5% increase in total dose relative to conventional dose in patients with T1, T2a, and T2b tumors

Following three-dimensional treatment planning using CT images, the treatment center and treatment fields are projected to the patients' surface by laser beam on the C arm. The prototype had an accuracy of 3 mm which was equivalent to conventional X-ray simulators but was not adequate for use in stereotactic radiotherapy. A new RT-CT system was developed to have a precise localization capability for stereotactic radiotherapy. Using this stereotactic RT-CT (SRT-CT) after three-dimensional planning, the treatment center is projected to the stereotactic frame automatically. In this study, the values of the x, y and z coordinates of the target center determined by SRT-CT are compared with those determined by the traditional method using CT localizing plates. The discrepancies were within 1.0 mm in 90% and 1.5 mm in 100% of 30 measurements in 16 patients. The disadvantages of SRT-CT may be that the accuracy of localization depends on the quality of calibration of laser beams. The traditional CT localizing method has superiority over SRT-CT because of its solid coordinates but its accuracy is vulnerable to alignment of CT fiducial marker plates. Therefore, the SRT-CT and traditional CT localizing methods would be complementary to each other for precise localization

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors	
1	948	Three-dimensional conformal setup (3D-CSU) of patients using the coordinate system provided by three internal fiducial markers and two orthogonal diagnostic X-ray systems in the treatment room	Fluoroscopy, Gold, Head, Humans, Japan, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Rotation	PURPOSE: To test the accuracy of a system for correcting for the rotational error of the clinical target volume (CTV) without having to reposition the patient using three fiducial markers and two orthogonal fluoroscopic images. We call this system "three-dimensional conformal setup" (3D-CSU). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three 2.0-mm gold markers are inserted into or adjacent to the CTV. On the treatment couch, the actual positions of the three markers are calculated based on two orthogonal fluoroscopies crossing at the isocenter of the linear accelerator. Discrepancy of the actual coordinates of gravity center of three markers from its planned coordinates is calculated. Translational setup error is corrected by adjustment of the treatment couch. The rotation angles (alpha, beta, gamma) of the coordinates of the actual CTV relative to the planned CTV are calculated around the lateral (x), craniocaudal (y), and anteroposterior (z) axes of the planned CTV. The angles of the gantry head, collimator, and treatment couch of the linear accelerator are adjusted according to the rotation of the actual coordinates of the tumor in relation to the planned coordinates. We have measured the accuracy of 3D-CSU using a static cubic phantom. RESULTS: The gravity center of the phantom was corrected within 0.9 +/- 0.3 mm (mean +/- SD), 0.4 +/- 0.2 mm, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm for the rotation of the phantom from 0-30 degrees around the x, y, and z axes, respectively, every 5 degrees. Dose distribution was shown to be consistent with the planned dose distribution every 10 degrees of the rotation from 0-30 degrees. The mean rotational error after 3D-CSU was -0.4 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SD), -0.2 +/- 0.4, and 0.0 +/- 0.5 degrees around the x, y, and z axis, respectively, for the rotation from 0-90 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Phantom studies showed that 3D-CSU is useful for performing rotational correction of the target volume without correcting the position of the patient on the treatment couch. The 3D-CSU will be clinically useful for tumors in structures such as paraspinal diseases and prostate cancers not subject to large internal organ motion

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A targeting system that integrates a CT-on-rails scanner with a linear accelerator (LINAC) was evaluated in the lead-in portion of a Phase I/II protocol for treating patients with paraspinal metastases. Patients were immobilized in supine position by a moldable body cushion vacuum wrapped with a plastic fixation sheet. Planning CT and immediately repeated CT were performed on the LINAC/CT-on-rails unit to assess respiratory-related vertebral body motion. Coplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using 7-9 beams was used to deliver 30 Gy in five fractions to the target volume, while limiting the spinal cord dose to <10 Gy. Pretreatment CT scans were fused with the planning CT scans to determine the correct target isocenter by accounting for any translational and roll (axial) rotational discrepancies from the planning CT. (Corrections caused by yaw and pitch rotations have not yet been implemented.) The reproducibility of the treatment isocenter as compared with the planned isocenter was measured with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), portal film imaging, and immediate post-treatment verification CT scans. Phantom measurements were taken for dose verification for each IMRT plan. RESULTS: Based on a total of 36 CT scans (3 for planning, 3 for respiration study, 15 pretreatment, and 15 post-treatment) from 3 patients, no respiration-associated vertebral body motion was seen. A comparison of the corrected daily anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) digital portal images with the planning AP and LAT DRRs confirmed that the isocenter setup accuracy for the 15 treatments was within 1 mm of the planning isocenter. The results from the immediate post-treatment CT scans reconfirmed the findings from the portal images and verified the absence of spinal movement during the treatment. The ion-chamber measurement for the high-dose region was within 2% of the planning dose for three patient treatment plans. Film dose measurement in an IMRT quality assurance phantom demonstrated good agreement from 90% to 30% isodose lines between the planned and measured results. CONCLUSION: Preliminary experience suggests that the near-simultaneous CT image-guided verification technique can be used as a new platform technology for extracranial applications of stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery to spinal and paraspinal tumors

Conventional radiotherapy takes advantage of the sparing effects of dose fractionation, but includes relatively large amounts of normal brain in the treatment volume the tolerance of which is dose-limiting. For some intracranial lesions it may not be optimal to treat with large single fractions due to tumor location or size. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy may not be optimum in all cases due to the necessary inclusion of normal structures. Through the development of relocatable head frames, the precision of stereotactic techniques and the biologic advantages of fractionation may be combined in stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). We report on the treatment of 68 patients with intracranial lesions using a dedicated stereotactic linear accelerator to deliver SRT between June 1992 and June 1993. SRT was used either in order to optimize dose distribution and spare normal tissues in patients with excellent prognosis or in order to increase the dose to tumor while keeping doses to normal tissues below tolerance levels in patients with poorer prognosis (dose escalation). Histologies treated included meningioma, low grade astrocytoma, pituitary adenoma and acoustic neuroma. The most common treatment sites were the parasellar region and cavernous sinuses. Most patients (79%) had surgical debulking prior to SRT. 10-12 patients were treated daily. Patient positioning using relocatable stereotactic frames was highly precise. Acute and subacute side effects were minimal and radiographic responses have been similar to those expected with conventional radiotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Early identification of nonresponders would allow prompt replacement of ineffective, toxic therapy by alternative, potentially more effective procedures. Frequent regional node involvement facilitates surface coil investigation with phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P-31 magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from 12 patients before radiation therapy or chemotherapy. In vivo three-dimensional localized P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift imaging was performed with a 1.5-T clinical imager and a dual-tuned H-1/P-31 surface coil. Proton decoupling and nuclear Overhauser enhancement were used to improve sensitivity and resolve overlapping signals in the phosphomonoester region of the spectrum. RESULTS: The average pretreatment ratio of phosphomonoester to beta-nucleoside triphosphate was significantly smaller in complete responders (n = 4) than in incomplete responders (partial responders plus nonresponders, n = 8) (0.0 +/- 0.0 vs 1.22 +/- 0.17 [P = .004]). CONCLUSION: Results of this preliminary study suggest that H-1-decoupled P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy may prove to be a useful predictor of therapeutic response in head and neck cancers

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated in Uppsala during 1991-97 were included (men = 14, women = 12; mean age = 39, range = 23-64). The nidus volumes ranged from 0.3 to 102 ml (mean = 24, median = 13). The follow-up included clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (and/or computed tomography) every 6-12 months for 3 years and final angiography. RESULTS: The volume changes at final follow-up in AVMs >25 ml were -89, -85, -44, -29, -7, 0, 0, +5 and +18 (%); in AVMs 11-24 ml, -100, -100, -97, -92 and 0 (%); and in AVMs <10 ml, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, -99, -98, -50, -0 and +40 (%). Two patients were lost to follow-up due to cerebral haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. Radiology displayed significant perifocal oedema in one patient and slight oedema in four patients. Of nine patients with epilepsy, seven became seizure-free after therapy while two continued to suffer from seizures. CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation is successful in a relatively high proportion of intermediate and large-sized cerebral AVMs. The adverse effects are acceptable. The advantage of proton treatment compared with gamma knife and LINAC stereotactic irradiation is that protons can irradiate even large volumes with a very sharp dose profile against normal surroundings. Thus, proton beam irradiation is a valuable option in the treatment of AVMs larger than 10 ml

ROKUS apparatus and a linear accelerator of 15 MeV were used for irradiation at a single dose of 1.5 Gy and a total dose of 3-6 Gy, at a 2-4 day interval. STI efficacy was assessed by a response of the peripheral and intrathoracic lymph nodes, tumor foci in the lungs, by a decrease in liver and spleen sizes, a decrease in body temperature and the end of night sweating. Of 25 patients a positive effect was achieved in 19, in 4 patients it was absent, and in 2 patients disease progression was observed. A marked positive effect was noted in 8 previously untreated patients, especially with respect to the elimination of signs of intoxication. A conclusion has been made that STI can be employed for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease patients as a method of general cytostatic action. STI causes a more noticeable and prolonged leukopenia than a cycle of polychemotherapy

C.) use a moving spot raster scan technique where the pion range is modulated in depth for each position of the moving spot. The spot scans in a stepwise fashion and can produce any desired field shape. This approach provides very good dose uniformity across the treatment field and allows maximum flexibility in shaping the treatment volume. Survival of cultured cells has been used as a biological dosimeter to test the isoeffectiveness of the pion dose distributions, which must be shaped in depth to compensate for the depth-dependent LET distribution. Isoeffectiveness across the treatment field has also been verified using this system, which involves irradiating cells supported in a gelatin matrix. The response of pig skin to pion irradiation at TRIUMF has provided a check on the in vivo RBE for acute effects derived from our earlier studies with mouse foot. In addition, the pig skin reactions have been followed for several months to assess the later dermal response. The RBE of our pion beam relative to 270 kVp X rays is approximately 1.5 for both the acute epidermal and the later dermal responses

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 1997, 102 patients with multiple cancer metastases received half-body irradiation (HBI) at the Center of Oncology--Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute in Krakow. Most of the patients (93/102) had bone metastases (Table 1). The HBI was performed with 9 MV photon beam from linear accelerator. In 88 patients only one region (upper, mid or lower) was treated, and 14 patients received upper and lower HBI (13 patients), or upper and mid HBI (one patient) (Table 2). The mean doses were: 6 Gy in upper HBI, 8 Gy in mid HBI, and 9 Gy in lower HBI (Table 3). RESULTS: The positive palliative effect (complete or partial pain relief) was observed in 77 (75.5%) patients (Table 4). Complete pain relief was higher in patients with prostate cancer, and in patients who received mid or lower HBI. During follow-up 47 (46.1%) patients developed pain progression after treatment (Table 5). The probability of survival without pain progression was higher in patients who developed complete pain relief (86.7% at 6 months, 69.3% at 12 and 24 months) than in patients with partial response (52.9% at 6 months, 32.8% at 12 months, and 5.5% at 24 months) (Figure 1). In most of the patients (74/102, 72.5%) the tolerance was good. CONCLUSIONS: HBI is an efficient method for palliation in patients with multiple painful metastases

[Czech]	Aged, Female, Graves Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	Orbital radiation therapy appears to be an effective and safe treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Five patients with Graves' ophtalmopathy were treated with external beam radiotherapy during 1996 and 1997 in St. Ann University Hospital. Four of them patients had a past history of hyperthyreoidism, one hypothyreoidism. The radiotherapy was performed with high-energy beam of a linear accelerator. The technique of irradiation employs 2 opposed beams tilted 5 degrees posteriorly. The use of the asymetric jaws is necessary to protect surrounding normal tissues. A course of radiotherapy 20.0 Gy (2.0 Gy per fraction) was given to the patients. The therapy was well tolerated. We have not observed any side late effects of radiotherapy. All patients showed good or excellent responses. The improvement of symptoms appeared within 3-6 months after the irradiation

The fourteen patients had chordomas or low grade chondrosarcomas and were all treated by the same techniques. The median tumor dose was 69.7 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a range from 66.6 to 74.4 CGE. (CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co). The daily fraction size was 1.8-2.1 CGE. The median follow-up time is 48 months, ranging from 30 to 68 months. All treatments were planned using a computerized multi-dimensional system with the position of the pituitary outlined on the planning CT scan. Review of the dose distribution indicated that the dose to the pituitary ranged from 60.5 to 72.3 CGE, with a median of 67.6 CGE. One female patient had decreased thyroid and gonadotropin function at the time of diagnosis and has been on hormone replacement since that time. The other three females were all pre-menopausal at the time of radiotherapy. At this time four patients (3 males and 1 female) have developed endocrine abnormalities 14 to 45 months after irradiation. All four had evidence of hypothyroidism and two have also developed corticotropin deficiency. The three males had decreased testosterone levels; the female patient developed amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia. All four are asymptomatic with ongoing hormone replacement

Protons offer an opportunity to increase the radiation dose to the prostate while minimizing treatment toxicity. METHODS: Six hundred forty-three patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons, with or without photons. Treatments were planned with a 3D planning system; patients received 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE per fraction. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The overall clinical disease-free survival rate was 89% at 5 years. When post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as an endpoint for disease control, the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for patients with an initial PSA of < 4.0 ng/ml, and 89%, 72%, and 53% for patients with initial PSA levels of 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and > 20.0, respectively. Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91%, 79%, and 40%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels.

METHODS: Three hundred nineteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer and initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 15.0 ng/mL or less received conformal radiation doses of 74 to 75 cobalt gray equivalent with protons alone or combined with photons. No patient had pre- or post-treatment hormonal therapy until disease progression was documented. Patients were evaluated for biochemical disease-free survival, PSA nadir, and toxicity; the mean and median follow-up period was 43 months. RESULTS: Overall 5-year clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates were 97% and 88%, respectively. Initial PSA level, stage, and post-treatment PSA nadir were independent prognostic variables for biochemical disease-free survival: a PSA nadir 0.5 ng/mL or less was associated with a 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rate of 98%, versus 88% and 42% for nadirs 0.51 to 1.0 and greater than 1.0 ng/mL, respectively. No severe treatment-related morbidity was seen. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that patients treated with conformal protons have 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rates comparable to those who undergo radical prostatectomy, and display no significant toxicity. A Phase III randomized dose-escalation trial is underway to define the optimum radiation dose for early-stage prostate cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analyses were performed for 1255 patients treated between October 1991 and December 1997. Outcomes were measured on primarily in terms of biochemical relapse and toxicity. RESULTS: The overall biochemical disease-free survival rate was 73%, and was 90% in patients with initial PSA <or=4.0; it was 87% in patients with posttreatment PSA nadirs <or=0.50. Rates dropped with rises in initial and nadir PSA values. Long-term survival outcomes were comparable with those reported for other modalities intended for cure. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton radiation therapy at the reported dose levels yielded disease-free survival rates comparable with other forms of local therapy, and with minimal morbidity. Dose-escalation strategies are being implemented to further improve long-term results

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer received accelerated photon and proton radiation, 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions/5.5 weeks, to the primary disease, involved lymph nodes, and potential areas of subclinical spread. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial control for local disease was 88%, and for neck node disease, 96%; yielding a 84% locoregional control rate at 5 years. Four patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 84%. The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival rate was 81%; at 5 years, it was 65%. All patients completed the prescribed treatment; though aggressive nutritional and anesthetic support was necessary. Late Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Protons used as a concomitant boost with photons effectively delivered an accelerated time-dose schedule to the cancer with a more tolerable schedule to surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary results reveal increased locoregional control without increased toxicity. Future studies must evaluate the optimum time-dose schedule

Ideally, the particle selected to deliver ionizing radiation for routine therapy should control the disease, cause minimal side effects, and be affordable. Two major properties for judging the utility of a particle, physical controllability and selective cell destruction, influence the decision for selection. The proton, at present, has the best combination of capabilities for routine radiation therapy. Heavier ions require further study to determine their role in patient treatment

The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy were seen to be important prognostic factors. The following survival patterns were observed. In eight cases with limited plaque disease there was prolonged disease-free survival after treatment with kilovoltage X-rays; after a median follow-up of 64 months there was only one case of progression to generalized disease. In 49 cases of generalized skin disease (plaque disease +/- tumours; erythroderma) treated with total skin electron beam therapy there was a 24% 5-year disease-free survival; this potential for long-term survival was seen in cases with generalized plaque disease without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the cases showed a continuously relapsing course. The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy can both be used as known prognostic factors to adopt a logical plan of treatment

This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. RESULTS: The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. CONCLUSION: The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan

BACKGROUND: Because of the surrounding vital structures and the difficulties in achieving wide surgical exposure, the treatment of clival lesions is challenging. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, many centers use facial incisions and osteotomies to approach clival lesions. Minimally invasive endoscopic techniques have the potential to minimize morbidity while yielding similar surgical results. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with tumors involving the clivus that underwent endoscopic resection between 2000 and 2004 were identified. Charts were reviewed for clinical characteristics, previous therapies, diagnosis, tumor extent, management modalities, length of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. There were four males and two females with a mean age of 50 years, ranging from 29 to 66 years. The most common presenting symptoms were visual disturbances. Three patients had prior craniotomy with subtotal tumor resection. The pathology included three clival chordomas, and one each of meningioma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. All patients were managed with computer-aided transnasal endoscopic tumor resection with neurosurgical standby or involvement. None of the patients required additional craniotomies. The mean follow-up was 13 (range, 8-24) months. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in three patients, and two patients are currently undergoing proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT). The average length of hospital stay was 2 (range, 2-3) days. There were no major postoperative complications. At the last follow-up, five patients were alive with two patients being free of disease. Two patients with residual disease are currently undergoing PBRT, and one patient developed distant metastasis. One patient died of unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report suggests that transnasal endoscopic management of clival lesions is a viable option to traditional open approaches with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The use of computer-aided surgery further minimizes surgical risks while maximizing tumor resection

RT was given to a total dose of 60 Gy in six weeks, for CRT additional simultaneous 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12) and mitomycin C (5 mg/m2 days 5 and 12) was administered. 67% respectively 82% of the patients had UICC stage II to IIIB disease predominantly with G2 and G3 squamous cell carcinomas. Local control after three years was 79% for the RT group vs. 82% for the CRT group. Three-year survival rate was 68% and 71%, respectively. These differences were not significant. Only for G1- compared to G3-tumors there is a significantly higher survival rate. Acute and late damage was slightly lower for the RT treatment group (77% and 25%) compared to the CRT group (79% and 30%). In both treatment groups there was one patient needing a permanent colostomy due to radiation induced proctitis. In conclusion, RT or CRT should be the primary form of treatment in patients with and canal carcinoma and abdominoperineal resection should only be performed in case of local recurrence or tumor persistence. The final decision about the indications for RT or CRT can only be made with the results of a prospective randomized trial	
0	264	Setup verification and in vivo dosimetry during intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for prostate cancer	Calibration, Catheterization, Electrons, Humans, Italy, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Male, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Software, Urethra/pa [Pathology]	The purpose of this study was to check the setup and dose delivered to the patients during intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IORT) for prostate cancer. Twenty eight patients underwent IORT after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer by means of a dedicated mobile accelerator, Novac7 (by Hitesys, SpA, Italy). A 9 MeV electron beam at high dose per pulse was used. Eighteen patients received IORT at escalating doses of 16, 18, and 20 Gy at 85% isodose, six patients for each dose level. Further, ten patients received 20 Gy at 85% isodose. The electron applicator position was checked in all cases by means of two orthogonal images obtained with brilliance intensifier. Target and organ at risk doses were measured in vivo by a MOSFETs dosimetry system. MOSFETs and microMOSFET dosimeters were inserted into sterile catheters and directly positioned into the rectal lumen, for ten patients, and into the bladder to urethra anastomosis, in the last 14 cases. Verification at 0 degree led to very few adjustments of setup while verifications at 90 degrees often suggested to bring the applicator closer to the target. In vivo dosimetry showed an absorbed dose into the rectum wall < or =1% of the total dose. The average dose value inside the anastomosis, for the 12 patients analyzed, was 23.7 Gy with a standard deviation of +/-7.6%, when the prescription was 20 Gy at 85% isodose. Using a C-arm mobile image intensifier, it is possible to assess if the positioning is correct and safe. Radio-opaque clips and liquid were necessary to obtain good visible images. In vivo MOSFETs dosimetry is feasible and reliable. A satisfactory agreement between measured and expected doses was found

CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma	
0	4123	Radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with the dynamic stereotactic irradiation	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Canada, Child, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Universities	From December 1986 through December 1988, 33 patients with inoperable arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were treated in our center with the dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses a standard 10 MV isocentric linear accelerator. There were 18 females and 15 males with a median age of 26 years (range: 9-69) and a median follow-up time of 16 months (range: 7-32). The arteriovenous malformation volumes treated ranged from 0.2 to 42 cm3. The prescribed doses at the isocenter varied from 50 to 55 Gy and were given as a single fraction in the majority of the patients (31/33). Late complications consisting of intracranial bleeding and/or hemiparesis were observed in three patients. To date, 21 patients underwent repeat angiographic studies at 1 year post-treatment. A complete obliteration of the lesion was achieved in 38% of these patients. For the patients whose arteriovenous malformation nidus was covered by a minimum dose of 25 Gy, the total obliteration rate was 61.5% (8/13), whereas none of the patients who had received less than 25 Gy at the edge of the nidus obtained a total obliteration. Our preliminary analysis at 1 year post-radiosurgery reveals results comparable to those previously reported for other radiosurgical techniques for the same follow-up period

The prescribed dose at isocenter ranged from 50 Gy to 55 Gy, given as a single fraction in 92% of the patients. Field sizes, defined at the 90% isodose surface, varied from 5 mm to 25 mm and were chosen in order to deliver 20 to 25 Gy at the periphery of the malformation. To date, 14 angiographic studies were repeated at 1 year posttreatment. In six patients (43%) a complete obliteration of the lesion was achieved. Late side effects were observed in three patients. Our initial analysis, at 1 year posttreatment, suggests that our results are comparable with those previously reported for other radiosurgical techniques. The linac-based dynamic stereotactic technique appears to be a valid alternative to radiosurgery with the Gamma unit or with heavy-charged particle beams	
1	1160	Clinical application of proton beams in the treatment of uveal melanoma: the first therapies carried out in Italy and preliminary results (CATANA Project)	Adult, Ciliary Body, Cobalt, Cyclotrons, Diffusion, Dose Fractionation, Eye Diseases/et [Etiology], Female, Great Britain, Humans, International Cooperation, Italy, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Safety, Survival, Survival Rate, Switzerland, Time, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: The first Italian proton therapy facility was realized in Catania, at the INFN-LNS. With its energy (62 MeV proton beam), it is ideal for the treatment of shallow tumors like those of the ocular region: uveal melanoma, first of all (the most common primary intraocular malignancy of adults) and other less frequent lesions like choroidal hemangioma, conjunctiva melanoma, and eyelid tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The first patient was enrolled in February 2002, and to date 30 patients have been treated. All patients had a localized uveal melanoma, with no systemic metastases, and had specific indications for proton beam radiation therapy: lesions between 5-25 mm basal diameter, not exceeding 15 mm thickness, absence of total retinal detachment or glaucoma. According to the tumor dimensions, 2 patients had a small lesion or T1 (6%), 3 had a medium-sized lesion or T2 (10%), 14 had a large lesion or T3 (47%), and 11 had an extra-large lesion or T3 (37%); no patient had extrascleral invasion or T4 of the TNM-AJCC Staging System. In most cases, the tumor infiltrated only the choroid (14 patients, 47%) or the choroid plus the ciliary body (14 patients, 47%). We also treated a primitive iris melanoma, without diffusion to the ciliary body. The target volume was defined as the tumor plus a safety margin of 2.5 mm, laterally and antero-posteriorly; this margin was increased to 3 mm if ciliary body involvement was present. The treatment was carried out in 4 fractions on 4 consecutive days to a total dose of 54.5 Gy (single fraction 13.6 Gy), which corresponds to 60 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent; single fraction 15 CGE), because the relative biological effectiveness is 1.1. RESULTS: The first follow-up is planned at 6-8 months after the end of the treatment, and our clinical end points are local control (defined as cessation of growth or tumor shrinkage), eye retention, and maintenance of a good visual function. At the time of this writing, we had preliminary results from 13 patients. Nine patients showed tumor shrinkage (69%), 3 a substantially stable dimension (23%), but almost all patients presented an increased ultrasound reflectivity (a surrogate for tumor control). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature data show that charged particle therapy has allowed an optimal local control in the treatment of uveal melanomas (about 96% in the different series, superior to that obtained with plaquetherapy [between 83% and 92%]), a metastatic rate slightly better than enucleation reports, and a survival rate of almost 90% at 5 years. Our preliminary results show a tumor response in almost all cases, with no major acute or subacute side effects. We thus plan to continue with our treatment procedures and our dose prescription

Most published experience relates to the use of the gamma knife. In this report, the authors review the methods and results of linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery in 44 patients with acoustic neuromas who were treated between 1993 and 1997. METHODS: Computerized tomography scanning was selected as the stereotactic imaging modality for target definition. A single, conformally shaped isocenter was used in the treatment of 40 patients; two or three isocenters were used in four patients who harbored very irregular tumors. The radiation dose directed to the tumor border was the only parameter that changed during the study period: in the first 24 patients who were treated the dose was 15 to 20 Gy, whereas in the last 20 patients the dose was reduced to 11 to 14 Gy. After a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 12-60 months), 98% of the tumors were controlled. The actuarial hearing preservation rate was 71%. New transient facial neuropathy developed in 24% of the patients and persisted to a mild degree in 8%. Radiation dose correlated significantly with the incidence of cranial neuropathy, particularly in large tumors (> or = 4 cm3). CONCLUSIONS: Single-isocenter LINAC radiosurgery proved to be an effective treatment for acoustic neuromas in this series, with results that were comparable with those reported for gamma knife radiosurgery and multiple isocenters

METHODS: Between 1993 and 2001, 42 patients with meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery at our institution. A mean radiation dose of 14 Gy was delivered to the tumor margin. The median tumor volume was 8.2 cm3 (mean, 8.4 cm3). Median follow-up was 36 months (mean, 38 mo). RESULTS: Control of tumor growth was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. There was no mortality or permanent extraocular motor or pituitary dysfunction. Treatment-related complications included new trigeminal neuropathy in 4.7% and a new visual field defect in 2.8%. Two patients required shunt placement after developing hydrocephalus. One patient with symptomatic temporal lobe edema underwent partial excision of the tumor. Improvement of existing cranial neuropathies was noted in 29% of affected trigeminal nerves, in 22% of oculomotor nerves, and in 13% of Cranial Nerves IV and VI.

Nitrogen has been previously measured either by counting (i) the annihilation radiation from 13N immediately after neutron irradiation with 14 MeV neutrons or (ii) the 'prompt' gamma rays from thermal neutron capture by 14N during irradiation with 14 MeV neutrons or with those produced by isotopic sources or a cyclotron. The present work describes studies into the feasibility of measuring 13N produced by irradiation with a neutron beam from the MRC Cyclotron. A complication of this method is that 13N is also produced in a reaction with 16O. Direct measurement of oxygen by use of the reactions 16O(n, p)16N or 16O(n, 2n)15O enables this interference to be estimated. The former reaction is possible with both 14 meV and cyclotron-produced neutrons but the 7.1 s half-life of 16N requires detectors to be placed in or very close to the irradiation site. In our particular circumstances this is not possible but the more energetic cyclotron neutron spectrum allows the production of 15O which has a half-life of 2.05 min and can be measured in a remote whole-body counter. A disadvantage with the cyclotron beam, in comparison with 14 MeV neutrons, is that a higher dose is required for similar accuracy. A reproducibility of about 4% is obtained with a dose equivalent of 0.01 Sv

DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized interventional case series. METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent TTT for small uveal melanomas located in the posterior pole of the eyes. Tumors were between 2.5 and 4 mm in thickness. TTT was performed with a diode laser at 810 nm. Patients had between one and three TTT sessions, with an intensity adapted to the coloration of the fundus impact. Biomicroscopic examination, ultrasonographic measurements, and angiography were performed before and two months, four months, and six months after treatment, then regularly during follow-up. RESULTS: Eight of the 18 tumors regressed and 10 recurred. The one- and two-year metastasis-free survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method were, respectively, 61.11% to 44.44% (95% confidence interval). Recurrences were managed with enucleation (three patients), proton beam therapy (six), or additional thermotherapy (one). After treatment, visual acuity was maintained or improved for the eight patients with nonrecurrent tumors. Pathologic analysis of the three enucleated eyes revealed scleral invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite encouraging initial short-term results obtained with TTT for the management of small choroidal melanomas, the occurrence of severe complications, especially recurrences and insufficient local tumor control, should raise concern about indications for primary TTT given as isolated treatment for small melanomas of the posterior pole

Both therapy modes were used in the therapy of 62 patients with tumors of the kidneys, 13 patients with tumors of the esophagus, 20 patients with tumors of the prostate and urinary bladder and 170 patients with tumors of the breast. The advantage of the described method is the possibility of simple, precise and easily reproducible irradiation in given localizations, good therapeutic effect and very good general tolerance as the patient concerns

Proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE), making use of the resonance reaction of 19F(p, alpha gamma)16O at 872 keV, and cyclic neutron activation analysis (CNAA), using the 19F(n, gamma)20F reaction in a reactor irradiation facility, were employed. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was used to calculate the volume, and, hence, mass of the sample excited in PIGE by determining the major element composition of the samples in order to express results in terms of concentration. From this preliminary investigation, a relationship is suggested between fluorine concentrations in bone and aluminium levels in the system

The major site of deposition is the reticuloendothelial system where it is retained for a long time. CASE REPORTS: Complications occurring late after exposure to thorotrast are described in two patients. RESULTS: One patient had angiosarcoma of liver metastatic to bone and bone marrow failure after a 43 year latency period. The other patient had a thorotrast granuloma and angiosarcoma of the liver after 22 year and 28 year latency periods respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Complications due to thorotrast appear to represent consequences of chronic alpha irradiation

In this work we investigate the dose at the surface of a water phantom and at a depth of 0.007 cm, the practical reference depth for skin as recommended by ICRP and ICRU, with ultra-thin TLDs and Monte Carlo calculations. The calculations and measurements were carried out for fields ranging from 5 x 5 cm2 to 20 x 20 cm2 for 6 MV, 10 MV and 18 MV photon beams. The variation of the surface dose with angle of incidence and field size was investigated. Also, the exit dose was computed and measured for the same fields and angles of incidence. The dose at the ICRU reference depth was computed. Good agreement (+/-5%) was achieved between measurements and calculations. The surface dose at the entrance increased with the angle of incidence and/or the field size. The exit dose decreased with the angle of incidence but it increased with field size. The dose at the surface of the patient is mostly dependent on the beam energy, modality and beam obliquity rather than the field size and field separation. By correlating TLD measurements with Monte Carlo calculations, we were able to predict the dose at the skin surface with good accuracy. Knowing the dose received at the surface of the patient can lead to prediction of skin reactions helping with the design of new treatment techniques and alternative dose fractionation schemes

Clinical and radiological (MRI) follow-up series suggest that having hemorrhaged once, recurrent hemorrhage with progressive neurologic dysfunction may commonly occur. We have therefore chosen to treat these lesions when first symptomatic with stereotactic linear radiosurgery (SLR). We now report, after a median follow-up of 27 months, 12 patients with CAs (9 women, 3 men, mean age 40 years) treated in this fashion. Ten patients presented with hemorrhage (3 had more than one hemorrhage): two patients had new onset seizures. All patients had enhanced MRI/MRAs characteristic of CA. There were five brainstem and five thalamic CAs, and one each in the temporal lobe and insula. Cerebral angiograms were done in 8 patients for comparison with their respective MRAs. Only one CA was visualized in the late venous phase on cerebral angiogram and identical vascular features were appreciated on the MRA. The diameter of the CAs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 cm with a mean of 1.6 cm. Dosimetry planning was based on MRI/CT features and the mean dose at the isocenter was 2.167 cGy (range = 2,000-2,500 cGy) delivered with a mean collimation diameter of 1.46 cm (range = 1.0-2.0 cm). All 12 patients continued to improve neurologically after SLR and had MRI-documented changes in their lesions: in general, the lesions became smaller and signal characteristics converted to methemaglobin. However, 1 patient had an early post-SLR hemorrhage, documented by MRI, at 4.5 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Heavy-charged-particle radiation has several advantages over protons and photons for the treatment of intracranial lesions; it has an improved physical distribution of the dose deep in tissue, a small angle of lateral scattering, and a sharp distal falloff of the dose. METHODS. We present detailed clinical and radiologic follow-up in 86 patients with symptomatic but surgically inaccessible cerebral arteriovenous malformations that were treated with stereotactic helium-ion Bragg-peak radiation. The doses ranged from 8.8 to 34.6 Gy delivered to volumes of tissue of 0.3 to 70 cm3. RESULTS. Two years after radiation treatment, the rate of complete obliteration of the lesions, as detected angiographically, was 94 percent for lesions smaller than 4 cm3, 75 percent for those of 4 to 25 cm3, and 39 percent for those larger than 25 cm3. After three years, the rates of obliteration were 100, 95, and 70 percent, respectively. Major neurologic complications occurred in 10 patients (12 percent), of whom 8 had permanent deficits. All these complications occurred in the initial stage of the protocol, before the maximal dose of radiation was reduced to 19.2 Gy. In addition, hemorrhage occurred in 10 patients from residual malformations between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures and headaches were less severe in 63 percent of the 35 and 68 percent of the 40 patients, respectively, who had them initially. CONCLUSIONS. Given the natural history of these inaccessible lesions and the high risks of surgery, we conclude that heavy-charged-particle radiation is an effective therapy for symptomatic, surgically inaccessible intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: a prolonged latency period before complete obliteration of the vascular lesion and a small risk of serious neurologic complications	
1	4142	Stereotactic helium ion Bragg peak radiosurgery for angiographically occult intracranial vascular malformations	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebral Angiography, Female, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Ions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Microsurgery, Middle Aged, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	Between July 1983 and July 1989, we treated 35 patients with surgically inaccessible, symptomatic angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs) using stereotactic heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery. AOVMs were located in the brainstem (19), thalamus or internal capsule (9), basal ganglia (3), deep cerebral hemisphere and motor area (3), or cerebellopontine angle (1). All patients presented with clinical and radiological evidence of previous hemorrhage, usually with multiple episodes of hemorrhage. Treatment volumes ranged from 80 to 15,200 mm3 and treatment doses from 7.7 to 34.6 Gy. Mean follow-up was 40 months, with 31 patients followed for at least 2 years. Clinical outcome was excellent in 46%, good in 34% and poor in 14%; 6% died. Twenty-seven patients in excellent and good condition prior to treatment remained stable or improved neurologically. Two patients initially in poor condition, who had previously received conventional radiotherapy, died at 9 and 14 months after treatment, respectively. Six patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage 2-60 months following treatment. Three of these patients made a complete recovery. Although a larger number of treated patients must be followed over longer periods of time, stereotactic heavy-particle radiotherapy may be a valuable treatment modality for surgically inaccessible intracranial AOVMs

The rate of complete angiographic obliteration 2 years after radiation was 94% in those lesions smaller than 4 cm3 (2.0 cm in diameter), 75% for those 4-25 cm3 and 39% for those larger than 25 cm3 (3.7 cm in diameter); at 3 years after radiation, the corresponding obliteration rates were 100, 95 and 70%. Major clinical complications occurred in 10 patients (8 permanent, 2 transient) between 3 and 21 months after treatment; all were in the initial stage of the protocol (higher radiation doses). 10 patients bled from residual malformation between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures were improved in 63% and headaches in 68% of patients. Excellent or good clinical outcome was achieved in 94% of patients. Compared to the natural history and risks of surgery for these difficult malformations, we consider these results encouraging. Heavy-charged-particle radiation is a valuable therapy for surgically inaccessible symptomatic cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: the prolonged latent period before complete obliteration and the small risk of serious neurological complications

The tumour dose ranged between 6 and 12 Gy and was limited by the low dose penetration of the neutron beam. A local control rate of 66% was obtained. The local control was affected by the tumour differentiation, residual status and histological subtype. Severe fibrosis of the subcutaneous tissues occurred in 40% usually after 2 years. No serious general side effects occurred. To optimize neutron therapy, a high energy clinically-based cyclotron with a fully rotational gantry and a multileaf collimator should be utilized. It seems that patients with locally advanced and well differentiated sarcomas can benefit from this therapy

Biological and medical aspects	Alpha Particles, Calibration, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Gamma Rays, Humans, Kinetics, Lymph Nodes/me [Metabolism], Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Thorium Dioxide/me [Metabolism], Tissue Distribution	The biological effect of alpha-radiation, which has been examined in this investigation, is the occurrence of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of Thorotrast patients. To set up a dose-effect relationship, it is necessary to estimate the absorbed dose of a single lymphocyte found in a blood sample. Then it would be possible to use chromosome aberrations of lymphocytes from peripheral blood as an indicator for estimating the effective radiation dose. The physical aspects of this investigation have been described in part I of this paper. In part II, biomedical considerations are described and discussed. The irradiation of the lymphocytes takes place in the whole lymphatic system, but the lymph node could have been used as a model for the lymphatic system. Based on the evaluation of size and distribution of Thorotrast conglomerates, the average annual dose in different structures of the lymph node has been determined. The Thorotrast content in lymph nodes depends on the region of the body from where the lymph nodes originate. It has been tried to compile the distribution of the lymph nodes in the different regions of the body. Annual doses have been calculated in these different regions in order to find a representative value for the whole body. The values describing the kinetics of the lymphocytes in the body have been used to convert the annual dose in lymph nodes into the dose of a lymphocyte found in a sample of peripheral blood. It is pointed out that the calculated dose of the lymphocytes, being 250 rad, is an estimation of an upper value. The lymphocytes are "in vivo" irradiated by the Thorotrast, but most of the calibrations used for biological dosimetry are referred to as "in vitro" experiments. The discrepancy between "in vivo" and "in vitro" results are discussed in the findings of this study and in other results	
0	1430	Cognitive function in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: prospective long-term follow-up	Adult, Cognition/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/et [Etiology], Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Time Factors	PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term cognitive function of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data of 95 AVM patients were prospectively assessed up to 3 years after radiosurgery. Of these patients, 39 had a follow-up of at least 2 years. Radiosurgery was performed using a modified linear accelerator (minimal doses to the target volume 15-22 Gy, median dose 20). The neuropsychological evaluation included testing of intelligence, attention, and memory. The effect of a preexisting intracranial hemorrhage, as well as AVM occlusion, on cognitive functions was analyzed after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: No cognitive declines were observed during follow-up. Instead significant improvements occurred in intelligence (1 year, +6.1 IQ points; 2 years, +5.1 IQ points), memory (1 year, +18.3 percentile score; 2 years, +12.2 percentile score), and attention (1 year, +19 percentile score; 2 years, +18 percentile score). Patients without previous intracranial hemorrhage improved more than patients with intracranial hemorrhage, although this difference was not statistically significant. The role of AVM occlusion on cognitive function is not clear at present. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery does not induce measurable deterioration of cognitive function in patients with cerebral AVMs

A 50 MeV cyclotron was used to deliver 9 Gy in a single fraction through 7 to 14 isocentric portals. The size and shape of the portals were customized to each treatment site. Nineteen patients have been followed for a median duration of 24 months following neutron radiosurgery. A radiographically demonstrable partial response was seen in 8 patients (42%). No complete responses were observed. There has been one post-treatment hemorrhage, no fatalities, and no evidence of radiation toxicity. The low response rate and absence of toxicity suggest that the appropriate dose for neutron radiosurgical treatment of AVMs is higher than the dose of 9 Gy at isocenter used in this initial study

The study was designed to serve as a cytogenetic analysis along with the therapeutic procedure of ankylosing spondylitis patients who were undergoing a treatment with (224)Ra-chloride. The total administered activity was 10 MBq, and the treatment followed a schedule of 10 i.v. injections per week, each with a dose of 1 MBq of (224)Ra. The calculation of absorbed doses delivered to the blood used the models suggested by the ICRP and yielded a value of 4.7 mGy/MBq. The frequency of chromosomal aberrations observed during the course of therapy was related to the blood dose. The frequency of dicentric chromosomes induced in vivo was found to agree well with the corresponding value of dicentrics induced in vitro. However--given that peripheral lymphocytes are in the cell cycle's G(0) stage--an unexpected increase with dose in the yield of chromatid breaks was observed, with about 95% of them occurring in cells without any other chromosome-type aberrations. Reasons for the production of chromatid breaks are discussed

Records of patients beginning radiation treatment at U.C. Davis Cancer Center within a 3-month period (3/1/92 to 5/31/92) were reviewed. Forty-seven percent of 102 patients and 56% of 123 courses of treatment involved AC. Six common uses of AC were identified: beam-split field matching, planned boosts, other field size changes, adjustments to match divergent fields, matchline feathering, and opposed tangential fields. This study demonstrates that asymmetric collimation is a useful and powerful clinical treatment tool with widespread applications to radiation therapy

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies

Our study focuses on a complex formed by the estrogen response element (ERE) DNA and the recombinant human estrogen receptor alpha (ER), which mediates the signalling of female sex hormones, estrogens. The method of native polyacrylamide retardation gel electrophoresis is used to study the stability of the complex under irradiation by low LET radiation ((60)Co gamma rays) and the ability of the separately irradiated partners to form complexes. The relative probabilities of ERE DNA strand breakage and base damages as well as the probabilities of damages to the ER binding domain are calculated using the Monte Carlo method-based model RADACK

To take advantage of this effect, techniques have been developed that combine existing hyperthermia devices with a linear accelerator. This allows concomitant delivery of either ultrasound or microwave hyperthermia with photon radiation therapy. Two techniques have been used clinically: the orthogonal technique, in which the microwave or ultrasound beam and the radiation beam are orthogonal to one another, and the en face technique, in which the ultrasound or microwave beam and the radiation beam travel into the tumour through the same treatment window. The en face technique has necessitated the development of special attachments so that the hyperthermia device can be mounted to the linear accelerator and so that non-uniform portions of the hyperthermia device can be removed from the radiation beam. For microwave therapy, applicators are mounted onto the linear accelerator using the compensating filter tray holder. For ultrasound, special reflector devices are mounted to a frame that is mounted onto the compensating filter tray holder of the linear accelerator. Because the linear accelerator is an isocentric device, the height of the radiation source is fixed, and this has necessitated specially designed devices so that the ultrasound support system is compatible with the linear accelerator. The treatment setups for both the en face technique and the orthogonal technique require the interaction of both hyperthermia and radiation therapy personnel and equipment. The dosimetry and day-to-day operations for each technique are unique. The simulation for the en face technique is much different from the simulation of a normal radiation treatment and requires the presence of a hyperthermia physicist. Also, for the en face technique, the attenuation of the microwave applicator and the thickness and attenuation of the ultrasound reflector system are taken into account for radiation dosimetry. This paper presents details of the dosimetry and logistics of the techniques for simultaneous thermoradiotherapy based on 7 years of experience treating more than 50 patients

Six patients had positron emission tomography 15 to 25 minutes after radiation therapy with a 42 MeV accelerator. Five patients had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and one required therapy for a carcinoma of the common bile duct. We sought to determine whether state-of-the-art PET technology could be used to monitor the three-dimensional activity distribution of radiation-induced radioactivity. At the time of the examination all six patients had sufficient concentrations of C-11 and N-13 activity in the irradiated volume to permit the evaluation of the activity distribution. We found significant activity at the body surface, which permitted field delineation. We conclude that the in vivo generated radioactivity can be monitored with PET	
1	897	Radiation exposure of personnel during intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT): radiation protection aspects	Combined Modality Therapy/mt [Methods], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Italy, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Neutrons, Occupational Exposure, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a multidisciplinary procedure which combines two conventional methods of cancer treatment surgery and radiation therapy. The purpose is to deliver a large single dose to the surgically exposed tumor bed while minimizing doses to normal tissues. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is a technique which allows irradiating the patient directly after the surgical operation using a linear accelerator that can be situated in the operating room. For medical accelerators with energy over 10MeV the need to characterize the neutron spectra for this particular situation arises from the fact that, when neutron spectra is not fully known, it becomes necessary to be more cautious introducing a weight factor wR of 20 (maximum value). This leads to overesteem the equivalent dose due to neutrons and it indicates to introduce additional (mobile) shields for photon and neutrons radiation not easily achievable in an operating room

All of them were treated with 20 MeV photon beam to a total dose of 67 to 71 Gy to the prostate. The effect of radiotherapy to a primary tumor were evaluated by means of repeated CT examination of the tumor volume. A statistically significant tumor regression was found to occur from the sixth month after finishing radiotherapy. The absolute majority of treatment complications was of the first grade. Neither moderate nor severe gastrointestinal or genitourinary complications were recorded. The follow-up data of our patients have confirmed that radiotherapy in localized prostatic carcinoma, when sophisticated techniques are employed, represents highly effective treatment modality which improved the quality of life in patients with prostate cancer

The treatment of bladder cancer with 60 converging pion beams was expected to have certain dose-distribution advantages with possibly fewer side effects than other high linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation therapies, such as neutrons. RESULTS. Early results were promising: 20 of 24 (83%) evaluable patients with sessile invasive bladder carcinomas had clinically complete responses. However, only 3 of 10 (30%) evaluable patients with superficial bladder tumors had clinically complete responses. This article reports the long-term follow-up (6-8 years) of these patients with emphasis on the late side effects of pion radiation therapy. Thirty-eight of the 41 (93%) patients treated died after a median survival time of 17 months (range, 4-98 months). Seventeen (45%) died of metastatic disease (in two instances, this was combined with a local recurrence) 5-27 months after radiation therapy. Four (10%) died of locally progressive disease, and eight (21%) died of late side effects of radiation therapy 9-98 months after treatment. All these patients were treated with more than 33 pion Gy and had generally a symptom-free interval of 9-18 months. The observed side effects were severe, consisting of chronic inflammation and vascular damage in the pelvic region often followed by ulceration, fistulas, and perforations throughout the intestines. In 11 patients, cystectomy and urinary diversion was necessary because of excessive fibrosis and bladder shrinkage. In eight patients, a colostomy was required for stenotic inflammatory disease, necrosis, and perforations of the intestines. The remaining nine patients (24%) died of causes unrelated to the primary disease 4-60 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the first Phase I/II trial using the Swiss piotron showed a high complete response rate in patients with sessile bladder cancers but also a high incidence of local recurrences and severe, in some instances lethal side effects. Although it is expected that these results will be the basis for future improvements, particularly regarding dosing and fractionation, this experience emphasizes the need for a sufficiently long observation period before reaching conclusions about any high LET treatment, such as neutron, pion, or heavy ion radiation therapy	
0	4164	Stereotactic percutaneous single dose irradiation of brain metastases with a linear accelerator	Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Female, Hospitalization, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques, Time	The effectivity of stereotactic percutaneous single dose irradiations in the treatment of solitary brain metastases has been assessed in a series of 12 consecutive patients. Only radioresistant deeply localized metastases have been treated. Photon-irradiation was carried out with the convergent beam technique using stereotactic localization methods, in a linear accelerator facility. In 11 of the 12 patients no side effects occurred. The first 7 patients, who could be observed 3 months or longer, have been studied in detail. In each of these cases single dose irradiation with 20-30 Gy yielded arrest of tumor growth. In one case a marked decrease in contrast enhancement and in four cases shrinkage of the metastasis as well as a marked decrease of the edema occurred. In every patient a marked, sometimes dramatic improvement of the clinical condition was achieved, beginning a few days after irradiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a valuable tool in the treatment of inoperable, radioresistant brain metastases, the major advantage being high efficacy and smoothness of the procedure, as well as extremely short hospitalization times (2-3 days)

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since January 1990, 97 patients with locally advanced carcinomas of the naso-, oro-, hypopharynx and the oral cavity in UICC stages III and IV were treated according to an accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy schedule with concurrent chemotherapy. The primary tumor and positive lymph nodes received a total dose of 72 Gy in 6 weeks. In the first 3 weeks, large fields were irradiated 5 times per week with 2 Gy per fraction. Thereafter, treatment was accelerated, giving 2 daily fractions of 1.4 Gy with minimal intervals of 6 hours. Target volumes were reduced after 49.6 and 59.4 Gy, excluding clinically uninvolved lymph node regions of low and high risk. On day 1, 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 50 mg/m2 folinic acid were given as intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion of 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 100 mg/m2 folinic acid, days 1 to 5. 10 mg/m2 mitomycin C was given on day 5 and 36 of the treatment. Salvage surgery was offered for residual disease 5 to 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Patient characteristics: 70 male, 27 female; age: 27 to 81 years; T2/T3/T4: 7/30/60; N0/N1/N2/N3: 20/18/53/6; nasopharynx/oropharynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity: 16/33/36/12. Median follow-up is 26 months. RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were 68 +/- 5% and 74 +/- 5%. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant influence of the geometric mean neck node diameter or the N-stage on loco-regional control and survival. T-stage, tumor volume, or tumor localisation did not become significant. Acute toxicity of this schedule was acceptable but required optimised supportive care. Treatment related grade 4+ late toxicity of mucosa, soft tissue and bone were observed with a cumulative frequency of 13% at 2 years. Two patients died during a phase of severe leuko- or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: This phase I to II trial shows favourable results using an intensified treatment radio-chemotherapy protocol. A phase III study is now planned, comparing this regime with an accelerated hyperfractionated radio-therapy alone to an increased total dose of 77.6 Gy

There is no established treatment plan for the disease, which may be attributed to its rarity and aggressiveness. Surgery is the choice of treatment in early cases. Radiotherapy follows surgery, and chemotherapy has an insignificant role in its treatment. Radiation with heavy ion beams is showing promising results in cancer therapy. Compared to conventional radiation, it permits selective irradiation with minimal injury to the surrounding normal tissue, and treatment with a low dose within a short interval of time is possible. We herein report a case of PMME treated with heavy ion radiation, the first case to be reported so far, and review the relevant literature

[Japanese]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Esophageal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophagus, Esophagus/ra [Radiography], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Skin, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, X-Ray Film	Since 1983 a clinical trial of proton beam radiotherapy has been conducted at the Proton Medical Research Center (PMRC) of the University of Tsukuba. We have made it a rule to do field localization by X-ray pictures before each treatment. For this purpose we have developed a localize-verify system consisting of a fluoroscopic unit and a real time digital image processing device. By using this system as well as X-ray films, field placement errors or corrected distance at field localization were measured in 11 patients with esophageal cancers. Measurements of corrected distances on a total of 177 localization attempts disclosed that correction by > 5 mm was necessary in 30.6% and by > 10 mm in 10.2% of all localization attempts. Corrected distances appeared to increase with age, possibly because the skin becomes looser and ambulatory status tends to be more limited in older patients. Field placement corrections of more than 5 mm were required in 66.7% of 60 localizations in patients > 80 years old. Two patients in whom the anatomical positions of the esophagus were easily movable are presented. The following common characteristics of these patients were considered high risk factors: they were more than 80 years old; lesions were located in the lower esophagus; and they had T1 tumors. These findings suggested that frequent positioning and verification of treatment fields are necessary in the accurate treatment of esophageal cancers, especially those in high-risk patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study reviewed 46 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 1998 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All patients had locoregionally confined disease; all but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 46 patients, 40 received combinations of X-rays (median, 48 Gy) and protons (median, 31.7 Gy) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-ray and proton radiation for the 40 patients was 76.0 Gy (range, 69.1-87.4 Gy). The remaining 6 patients received only proton beam therapy (median, 82.0 Gy; range, 75-89.5 Gy). RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 46 patients, patients with T1 (n = 23), and those with T2-T4 (n = 23) was 34%, 55%, and 13%, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for the 46 patients, those with T1, and those with T2-T4 was 67%, 95%, and 33%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate for patients with T1 and T2-T4 lesions was 83% and 29%, respectively. The site of the first relapse was locoregional for 16 patients and distant organs for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally confined esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedule, and best combinations of protons and conventional X-rays with or without chemotherapy	
0	2141	Successful conversion from a linear accelerator-based program to a Gamma Knife radiosurgery program: the Cleveland Clinic experience	Brain Neoplasms/cl [Classification], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Ohio, Oncology Service,Hospital/og [Organization & Administration], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology/og [Organization & Administration], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies, Surgery Department,Hospital/og [Organization & Administration]	From August 1989 to January 1997, 307 treatments in 293 patients were performed with a linear accelerator-based (LINAC) stereotactic radiosurgery system. Because of the program s success, the need for a dedicated radiosurgery unit in Ohio and the desire to treat functional disorders, the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) obtained the first Gamma Knife in the state of Ohio. Based on the previous volume of patients for radiosurgery, it was estimated that 75-100 patients would be treated during the first year of operation. However, during the first calendar year, 214 treatments were performed on 205 patients, which far exceeded expectations. The success of the CCHS Gamma Knife Center can be attributed to an increase in a number of factors. These included marketing efforts, patient awareness, increased use for functional disorders, physician understanding of radiosurgery, use by qualified nonaffiliated radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons, and outpatient delivery (95% with the Gamma Knife vs <5% with the LINAC). With proper planning, education, and awareness, the opening of a Gamma Knife Center can greatly increase the volume of radiosurgery performed when compared with a LINAC-based program

We review our experience over 7 years treating 29 consecutive patients with a modified linear accelerator (linac) SRS system. Between August 1989 and October 1995, 29 patients with a median age of 67 years (range 26 to 83) underwent linac SRS treatment. Twenty-five patients had unilateral acoustic neuromas, and four patients with neurofibromatosis type II had bilateral vestibular schwannoma. Eligibility criteria for SRS were recurrent tumors (n = 9), age >65 (n = 16), or patient preference (n = 6). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed on all patients. The most common presenting symptoms were hearing impairment (18 patients) and gait difficulties (17 patients). Ten patients were deaf in the affected ear prior to treatment. Doses to the periphery of the tumor ranged from 800 to 2,400 cGy (median 1, 600 cGy) prescribed to the 50% to 80% isodose line (median 80%). After a median radiographic follow-up of 49 months (range 4 to 110 months), 11 tumors were smaller, 17 were stable, and one had evidence of progression (at 41 months). The 5-year local disease control rate (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 94%. Acute complications were minimal, with only two patients experiencing nausea and vomiting after the procedure. Long-term complications included new or progressive trigeminal and facial nerve deficits with estimated 5-year incidences of 15% and 32%, respectively. Subjective hearing reduction or loss occurred in 14 (74%) of the 19 patients who had useful hearing prior to treatment. Five patients died from unrelated causes. These results suggest that linac SRS provides excellent short-term tumor control rates. Since there was a high risk of cranial nerve neuropathy, we do not recommend using only computed tomography-based planning and high prescription doses. Int. J. Cancer (Radiat. Oncol.

These include: 130 patients treated for definitive radiation therapy of choroidal melanoma; 17 patients treated for tumors of the base of skull, cervical spine and cranium, which abut structures of the central nervous system (CNS); 23 patients treated for sarcomas of soft tissue and bone; 65 patients treated for carcinoma of the prostate; 14 patients treated for carcinoma of the rectum and anus; and 23 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the oral cavity and oro-pharynx. Data on causes of failure and morbidity of treatment are presented. Overall the results are judged to be extremely encouraging. In particular, the treatment of the choroidal melanomas and sarcomas abutting CNS structures have clear clinical value, and the treatment of prostatic tumors and tumors of the head and neck are thought to be promising

We havefound it necessary to 1) obtain an accurate three-dimensional determination of the treatment volume including the density of all tissues in the beam path; 2) construct an adequate bolus to compensate for tissue heterogeneities; 3) use much more precise and accurate immobilization and patient positioning devices than used in photon irradiation; 4) treat with both protons and photons so as to keep the skin dose within an acceptable level. IN TISSUES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT INHOMOGENETIES DUE TO BONE AND AIR SPACES WE HAVE DELIVEREDA WELL-DEFINED DOSE TO INVOLVED TISSUES WHILE SPARING DISTAL SENSITIVE STRUCTURES. However, in those regions where there is much "fine structure" of tissue density, it has been difficult to compensate satisfactorily for the inhomogeneties

This is so as the smaller treatment volume has permitted a higher dose to the target (hence a high tumor control probability) and a lesser volume of non-target tissues being irradiated (consequently a reduced frequency and severity of treatment related morbidity). There are in place several important means for further improvements in dose distributions. These include: (a) 3D graphic reconstruction of the affected part with definition of the position of the tumor vis-a-vis the adjacent normal structures; (b) explicit inclusion in the treatment plan of the uncertainty band around each isodose contour; (c) on-line contrast enhanced visual monitoring of the target tissue during the individual treatment session; (d) gating of treatment so as to reduce the impact of patient motion on the needed treatment volume; (e) use of computer control systems to execute the treatment; and (f) use of treatment methods which achieve a reduced treatment volume. In an examination for sites for which treatment volumes might be decreased by a substantial factor we have compared treatment volumes for radical surgical and radiation therapy. Results are presented for carcinomas of the cervix (Stage IB), breast (Stage II), floor of mouth (Stage II). We describe a system developed here for on-line visual monitoring of the tissues covered by the treatment field. Brief descriptions are given of results of low LET charged particle radiation therapy and of intraoperative electron beam therapy. Also, the program developed here to use computer graphic techniques to display tumor and normal structures and isodose countours with uncertainty bands around each contour is mentioned

To achieve these dose distributions in patients requires use of modern imaging techniques, rigid immobilization systems, confirmation of target position vis a vis the proton beam at each treatment session, treatment planning which feature beam's eye view, displays of uncertainty, dose at each anatomic point, boli based on accurate assessment of density along each pixel, etc. Experience at MGH/MEEI/HCL has yielded a disease-free survival of 78% for patients with chordoma/chondrosarcoma of base of skull.

The carbon-ion beams were accelerated with the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). Six primary cultures obtained by biopsy from 6 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were irradiated with two different mono-LET beams (LET = 13 keV/micrometer, 76 keV/micrometer) and 200kV X rays. Residual chromatin breaks were measured by counting the number of non-rejoining chromatin fragments detected by the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique after a 24 hour post-irradiation incubation period. The induction rate of residual chromatin breaks per cell per Gy was the highest for 76 keV/micrometer beams on all of the cells. Our results indicated that cell which was more sensitive to the cell killing was similarly more susceptible to induction of residual chromatin breaks. Furthermore there is a good correlation between these two end points in various cell lines and primary cultured cells. This suggests that the detection of residual chromatin breaks by the PCC technique may be useful as a predictive assay of tumor response to cancer radiotherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One normal human and four human-tumor cell lines were used. Cells were irradiated with carbon ions accelerated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan. The LET values were estimated to be 13.18 keV/microm for low-LET beams and 76.92 +/- 0.20 keV/microm for high-LET beams. Fractionated-dose irradiations were carried out with 5 fractions within a 24-h interval. RESULTS: The surviving fractions for the fractionated-dose irradiation with X-rays and carbon ions decreased exponentially with increasing the number of fractions in the tumor cell lines. In contrast, the surviving fractions for the carbon ions in normal human cells decreased exponentially as well as the tumor cell lines, while it tended to level off from the 3rd to the 5th fraction in the case of using X-rays. CONCLUSION: The change in both the recovery ratio of the PLDR and radiosensitivity by every fractionated-dose irradiation depends on individual cell lines and the quality of radiations	
0	529	The PCC assay can be used to predict radiosensitivity in biopsy cultures irradiated with different types of radiation	Biological Markers, Biopsy, Carbon, Carbon/ch [Chemistry], Cell Line,Tumor, Chromatin/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosome Breakage, Female, Heavy Ions, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Tolerance, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Research, Uterine Neoplasms, X-Rays	The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers for radiosensitivity using the relationship between cell killing and the yield of excess chromatin fragments detected with the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique. This method was applied to primary cultured cells obtained from biopsies from patients. Six primary culture biopsies were obtained from 6 patients with carcinoma of the cervix before starting radiotherapy. The cultures were irradiated with two different LET carbon-ion beams (LET = 13 keV/microm, 77.1+/-2.8 keV/microm) and 200 kV X-rays. The carbon-ion beams were produced by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). PCC was performed using the polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion technique. The yield of excess chromatin fragments were measured by counting the number of unrejoined chromatin fragments detected with the PCC technique after a 24-h post-irradiation incubation period. Obtained results indicated that cultures which were more sensitive to killing were also more susceptible to the induction of excess chromatin fragments. Furthermore there was a good correlation between cell killing and excess chromatin fragments among the 6 cell cultures examined. There is also evidence that the induction of excess chromatin fragments increased with increasing LET as well as cell-killing effect in the same cell culture. The data reported here support the idea that the yield of excess chromatin fragments detected with the PCC technique might be useful for predicting the radiosensitivity of cells contained in tumor tissue, and to predict responses to different radiation types	
0	4188	Neutron therapy--the historical background	Cyclotrons/hi [History], Energy Transfer, History,20th Century, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Neutrons/hi [History], Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Oxygen, Physics, Radiation, Radiobiology, Sweden, Time, Universities, X-Rays	Neutron therapy was first introduced by Stone et al. in 1938, i.e. more than 10 years earlier than electron beam therapy and only 6 years after the discovery of neutrons. In spite of the impressive accomplishment in generating an adequate therapy beam, time was also found for careful radiobiological studies of neutron beams. However, it was not considered that for a certain early reaction the late effects were much greater with neutrons than with x-rays. The severe late sequelae in proportion to the few good results motivated the closure of this therapy. Neutron therapy was again introduced in Hammersmith hospital at the end of the 1960's. The major reason seems to have been to overcome the oxygen effect. Encouraging results were reported. It was argued that the very favourable statistics on local tumour control were obtained at the expense of more frequent and more severe complications. A clinical trial in Edinburgh seemed to indicate this, but it was not proved in the end as the two trials differed regarding fractionation. Today about 16,000 patients have been treated with neutrons. The neutron beams now used differ significantly, both regarding dose distributions and microdosimetrical properties, from those utilized earlier. The advantage of neutrons is still, however, controversial. There are indications that neutron treatment may be favourable for some tumours. A careful cost-benefit study ought to be performed before the creation of a neutron therapy centre in Sweden as the group of patients suitable for neutrons is limited, and there may be new possibilities for improvement of photon and electron treatment with much smaller resources

Thirty-four tumors were included in the experimental groups, of which twenty-three were irradiated and eleven served as controls. Tumors were irradiated with protons produced at the 160 megavolts Harvard cyclotron. The dose delivered to the tumor ranged from 7.5 to 27.5 proton gray in a single treatment, and 25.0 proton gray delivered in two fractions separated by 24 hours. Reduction of tumor growth was significantly greater than controls (p less than 0.001) with treatment doses greater than or equal to 17.5 proton gray. Histologic examination revealed a marked decrease of mitotic activity in all specimens examined 48 hours after treatment at these higher doses. Total regression without evidence of remaining malignant cells was noted in three tumors treated at 17.5 proton gray or above. Our results indicate that human retinoblastoma in a murine host, with a tumor mass similar to that seen in a clinical setting, is sensitive to radiation by high energy protons

Nine normal subjects were controls. Adenohypophyseal tropic hormones and hydrocortisone were radioimmunoassayed before and after administration of nakom, a dopaminergic agent. ACTH, hydrocortisone, TTH, parlodel secretion were found decreased and LH increased in patients with Itsenko-Cushing's disease, and no STH increase characteristic of normal subjects was observed. During remission after proton therapy adenohypophyseal tropic hormones and hydrocortisone secretion normalized in response to nakom. Recovery of STH secretion was observed, but not in all patients, this being confirmed by the absence of a normal somatotropin response in nakom test in 26.32% of patients

The procedure requires six injections of local anesthetic and application of a stereotactic frame by fixation into the outer table of the skull, and has been used during the past 20 yr to treat over 1,000 patients with cerebral AVMs. No effort was made to control blood pressure. Blood pressure increased during administration of the local anesthetic and application of the frame. Maximum systolic and mean arterial pressures averaged 160 +/- 17 and 118 +/- 7 mmHg (mean +/- SD), respectively. This represented an average increase of 44 mmHg (38%) in systolic pressure and 32 mmHg (37%) in mean blood pressure at some point during the procedure (P less than 0.01 compared with pretreatment control pressures). Systolic pressure increased more than 60 mmHg in 21% of patients. Nevertheless, none of these 56 patients nor any of the more than 1,000 patients treated in similar fashion suffered a clinically evident AVM hemorrhage during the procedure. Since the treatment protocol has not changed materially during the past 20 yr, the authors assume that most patients treated in this fashion developed a similar degree of hypertension and conclude from this large clinical experience that moderate arterial hypertension does not precipitate spontaneous hemorrhage of intracranial AVMs

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-nine patients were treated between April 1996 and September 2000. The median age was 56 years (range: 29-80), and median maximal tumor diameter was 20 mm (range: 9-40). A total of 11 patients had fifth and/or seventh cranial nerve dysfunction before irradiation; 2 patients had only facial weakness, 5 patients had only facial numbness, and 4 patients had both facial weakness and numbness. Thirty-three patients were treated with primary FSRT, and 6 patients were treated for recurrent or persistent disease after previous surgery. All patients were treated with 6-MV photons using a stereotactic system with a relocatable frame. The 39 patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Median follow-up was 21.8 months (range: 4.4-49.6). RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 37 patients (95%). Two patients experienced deterioration of their symptoms at 3 and 20 months as a result of clinical progression in one case and tumor progression in the other and underwent surgery post FSRT. A total of 19/28 (67.9%) patients preserved serviceable hearing after FSRT. Deterioration of the facial and trigeminal nerves was observed in only 2 patients who were treated with surgery post FSRT. CONCLUSION: FSRT provided excellent tumor control with minimal morbidity and good hearing preservation in this cohort of patients. Longer follow-up is required to confirm long-term control rates

The described irradiation technique using special shielding blocks extends the dose distribution till to the region of paraaortic nodes in an extended field.

A mixture of nitrogen and oxygen containing 8.0 to 8.5% of O2 was used to provoke acute hypoxia during irradiation. The applied doses of external irradiation was simultaneously increased by 40%. On the basis of a randomized study with 120 patients, acute hypoxia was found to protect healthy tissues against post-radiation damage. When the doses of 96 Gy in the paracervical space and that of 75 Gy in the pelvic wall were applied, acute side-effects decreased significantly if compared with a conventional radiotherapeutic procedure (p less than 0.01). Radiological preconditions for using acute hypoxia in radiotherapy are discussed

Analysis of early and late side effects and complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, early and late complications were assessed in 50 patients as a function of hypoxyradiotherapeutic dose increase. The preliminary treatment results of this radiotherapeutic modification were evaluated after a median follow-up of 48 months using Kaplen-Meier analysis. Between April 1991 and February 1997, 50 patients (36 men and 14 women) with colorectal carcinoma were treated preoperatively with locoregional accelerated hypofractionated hypoxyradiotherapy. The extent of disease was classified according to Dukes' criteria (A: four patients, B. 28 patients, C: 18 patients). We used a 20-MeV linear accelerator with two parallel opposed fields. Hypoxyradiotherapy was performed extending from the perineum to the L4 region. Acute hypoxia was induced during irradiation by ventilation of a hypoxic gas mixture containing 7.8-8.0% oxygen. Total doses of 24 Gy/8 days, 28 Gy/9 days, and 32 Gy/10 days were applied in five, 20, and 25 patients, respectively. Low anterior resection or abdominoperineal amputation of the rectum was performed the day after completion of preoperative hypoxyradiotherapy. The early reactions after irradiation were evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute (CTC-NCI). RESULTS: Early postirradiation proctitis was documented in three and early radiation-induced cystitis in two patients only. Neither early nor late radiation-associated complications were observed in any of the three hypoxyradiotherapy schedules during the follow-up period of 6-105 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (median 48 months), a 5-year overall survival rate of 61.5% and a local relapse-free survival rate of 84.2% can be expected. Treatment failures were predominantly systemic. CONCLUSION: We believe it can be concluded that acute hypoxia has a radioprotective effect on normal tissues during accelerated hypoxyradiotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. Hypoxyradiotherapy permits safe administration of doses higher than those tolerated by normoxic, noncanceorus tissue, resulting in the amplification of the biological effect of radiation on tumor tissue and contributing to an improved outcome after combined radiosurgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma	
0	1369	Remote afterloading for neutron brachytherapy using californium-252	Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/is [Instrumentation], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], California, Californium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Energy Transfer, Equipment Design, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Movement, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Safety	BACKGROUND: Despite a pronounced technical process attained in radiotherapy of malignant neoplasms, no remarkable improvement in the treatment results has been achieved. The reason for this stagnation is the interaction between tumor cell and photon radiation. Tumor resistance against photon bombardment can be broken down by applying high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation-based treatment. The discovery of californium-252 ((252)Cf) nuclide, a source of gamma neutron radiation, established a precondition for using neutrons in tumor brachytherapy. The design of a remote afterloading device using (252)Cf sources remains an unsolved problem. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The afterloading device has been designed as a stationary radiator which is composed of three mutually interconnected units: 1. the control and drive unit consisting of a control computer and a motor-driven bowden system carrying the (252)Cf source; 2. the source which is housed in a watertight concrete vessel-storage strong room, situated in the ground at a depth of 25 cm beneath the patient's bed; 3. the afterloading application module installed in the irradiation room. RESULTS: Remote afterloading allows simple, inexpensive and highly efficient radiation protection and work safety for the operating personnel. The sources may be moved arbitrarily during treatment with a position accuracy of 0.5-1.0 mm within a distance of 520 cm from the source storage position in the strong room to the application position. Both afterloading systems' unused indexer outputs are protected electronically and mechanically against any unintentional movement of the source outside the application tubes. CONCLUSION: The technologic concept of the present automatic afterloading device for neutron brachytherapy represents a possible option from the range of conceivable design variants, which - while minimizing technologic and economic requirements - provides the operating personnel with optimum protection and work safety, thus extending the applicability of high LET radiation-based treatment methods in clinical practice

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed gate pulse controller that starts and stops irradiation at a chosen phase of the respiratory cycle by controlling a linear accelerator was used in six patients with lung cancer. A laser displacement sensor was used for the detection of respiratory motion. Three patients underwent radiation therapy during the cycles between 50% expiration and 50% inspiration (step 1), and three patients underwent radiation therapy during the cycles between 70% expiration and 30% inspiration (step 2). RESULTS: The system functioned well; irradiation was verified with portal verification radiography in all six patients. The range of the tumor position during synchronized irradiation was detectable with fast portal localization radiography. The treatment times for steps 1 and 2 were 1.38-1.71 and 2.03-2.18 times longer, respectively, than those for conventional irradiation. CONCLUSION: Synchronized irradiation with the authors' system allowed convenient and reliable reduction of the target volume. Further study is needed to standardize the system for clinical use

The majority received 30 Gy of 3 MeV electrons in 12 treatments over three weeks. Eighty-eight patients had received prior therapy. Fifty patients had cutaneous plaques only (T1-2N0), and 56 had more advanced disease. At five years, actuarial survival is 66.7% and disease-free survival 21.4%. The median time to relapse is 12 months; prolonged survival is seen only with complete response. Compared with more advanced stages, T1-2N0 patients have more frequent complete response (96% vs 71%) and better relapse-free survival at five years (32 vs 7%). Of 14 patients with T2 disease in continuous complete remission for from 45-113 months, only one has relapsed. This suggests that cure is possible in up to 26% of patients with T2 disease who achieve complete response. In advanced stages, complete response is more likely with doses over 25 Gy (80 vs 50%). First recurrences were predominently in sites of previous involvement. Death resulted mainly from extracutaneous dissemination or failure to induce remission

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI	
1	4208	Optimization of radiotherapy for patients with cranial chordoma. A review of dose-response ratios for photon techniques. [Review] [49 refs]	Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Canada, Chordoma, Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Combined Modality Therapy, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Methods, Morbidity, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Survival, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND. Cranial chordomas arise adjacent to critical neural tissues within the notochordal remnants in the clivus, frequently compromising adequate surgical removal of the primary tumor and making difficult the delivery of an adequate dose of radiotherapy. The optimal dose and fractionation have not been established. METHODS. The results of radiation combined with surgery, radiation alone, and surgery alone were compared based on the cases of 159 patients reported in the literature. An analysis of the optimal biologically equivalent doses (BED) was performed using the linear-quadratic formula on 47 patients. RESULTS. Past techniques using conventional photon irradiation have shown no dose-response relationship. Survival is improved for patients undergoing surgery followed by radiotherapy. CONCLUSION. Combined surgery and postoperative radiation is preferable to radiotherapy or surgery alone for management of cranial chordoma. Newer radiotherapeutic approaches will allow increased dose delivery to the target volume without an anticipated increase in radiation morbidity. It is believed that this will increase tumor control. Recent results of studies using charged particle therapy in cranial chordoma suggest that this may be an alternative way to optimize radiotherapy. [References: 49]

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used three kinds of human lung cancer cell lines with identical genotypes, except for the p53 gene. These cells were exposed to X-rays or accelerated carbon-ion beams. The cellular sensitivities were determined by a colony-forming assay. The detection and quantification of cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) were evaluated and compared by acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining for fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: We found that (1) there was no significant difference in cellular sensitivity to LET radiation >70 KeV/microm, although wild-type p53 cell sensitivity to X-rays was higher than that of mutated p53 or p53-null cells; (2) low-LET radiation effectively induced apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells as compared with mutated p53 and p53-null cells; and (3) high-LET radiation induced p53-independent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that high-LET radiotherapy is expected to be a valid application for patients carrying mutated p53 cancer cells. We proposed that the elucidation of the p53-independent apoptosis-related genes might provide new insights into radiotherapy for cancer

Recently, both radical resection and charged-particle irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery have reportedly been found effective for tumor control and for promoting a better quality of life in patients. In this article the authors analyzed the outcomes in 17 patients with skull base chordomas who were surgically treated at Kobe University Hospital between 1972 and 2000. METHODS: Preoperative radiological examinations included magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, angiography, and balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery. Among the various surgical approaches used to remove the tumor were the frontoorbitozygomatic, transmaxillary, transcondylar, transsphenoidal, and the transbasal. Total removal was achieved in two (12%), near-total removal in three (18%), subtotal removal in nine (52%), and partial removal in three patients (18%). Since 1990, chordomas have been radically resected via various skull base approaches; the combined total or near-total removal rate has been 80% in this period. Radical removal of the tumors has not led to an increased risk. At the final follow-up review (mean 59.5 month), 75% of the patients were still alive, and 25% had died of chordoma recurrence. The overall recurrence-free survival rate was 82% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate in the five patients who underwent the operation during the past decade was 77% (mean follow up of 5.2 years). In two patients with recurrent tumors who underwent radiosurgery, no evidence of tumor regrowth was demonstrated at 3 years posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that for the treatment of skull base chordomas radical resection is a key factor for longer survival and improved quality of life. Patients with sufficiently small tumors, which show a favorable configuration and location, can be suitable candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery

The treatable protocol depth (TPD) was utilized as an evaluation index. MCNP-4B calculations were performed for near-threshold (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be at a proton energy of 1.900MeV and for a polyethylene BDE. Consequently, the TPD was increased by increasing T/N ratio, i.e., the ratio of the (10)B concentration in the tumor ((10)B(Tumor)) to that in the normal tissue ((10)B(Normal)), and by increasing (10)B(Tumor) and (10)B(Normal) for constant T/N ratio. It has been found that the BDE becomes unnecessary from the viewpoint of increasing the TPD, when (10)B(Tumor) is over a certain level

The pelvis was irradiated with 60 Gy followed by 30 to 45 Gy to a small volume using a lateral pendulum. The small-field irradiation was performed using a new beam-directing device consisting of a rod with a central pivot. Favourable results were achieved, despite the fact that most of the patients had advanced carcinoma	
1	4215	Importance of precise positioning for proton beam therapy in the base of skull and cervical spine	Adult, Boston, Brain, Brain Stem, Cervical Vertebrae, Child, Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Lobe, Uncertainty, X-Rays	Using proton beam therapy, high doses have been delivered to chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Dose inhomogeneity to the tumors has been accepted in order to maintain normal tissue tolerances, and detailed attention to patient immobilization and to precise positioning has minimized the margins necessary to ensure these dose constraints. This study examined the contribution of precise positioning to the better dose localization achieved in these treatments. Three patients whose tumors represented different anatomic geometries were studied. Treatment plans were developed which treated as much of the tumor as possible to 74 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) while maintaining the central brain stem and central spinal cord at less than or equal to 48 CGE, the surface of the brain stem, surface of the spinal cord, and optic structures at less than or equal to 60 CGE, and the temporal lobes at less than or equal to 5% likelihood of complication using a biophysical model of normal tissue complication probability. Two positioning accuracies were assumed: 3 mm and 10 mm. Both proton beam plans and 10 MV X ray beam plans were developed with these assumptions and dose constraints. In all cases with the same positioning uncertainties, the proton beam plans delivered more dose to a larger percentage of the tumor volume and the estimated tumor control probability was higher than with the X ray plans. However, without precise positioning both the proton plans and the X ray plans deteriorated, with a 12% to 25% decrease in estimated tumor control probability. In all but one case, the difference between protons with good positioning and poor positioning was greater than the difference between protons and X rays, both with good positioning. Hence in treating these tumors, which are in close proximity to critical normal tissues, attention to immobilization and precise positioning is essential. With good positioning, proton beam therapy permits higher doses to significantly more of the tumor in these sites than do X rays	
1	4216	3-D comparative study of proton vs. x-ray radiation therapy for rectal cancer	Aged, Boston, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, X-Rays	To assess the usefulness of proton beams for treatment of patients with rectal cancer, we have performed comparative 3D treatment planning for proton beam and x-ray beam therapy. Three common x-ray techniques (AP-PA, 3-field, and 4-field box), a proton beam only plan, and a proton boost plan were compared. The plan which would have been treated without the aid of the 3D planning system was also simulated. Dose distributions were analyzed and dose-volume histograms computed for the target volumes and critical normal tissues. Analyses of these plans demonstrate that the proton beam techniques reduce the volume of small bowel irradiated. This may allow higher doses to be delivered to the tumor, with a probable increase in local control, or a reduction in normal tissue complications probability. All the plans developed with the 3D planning system treated significantly less bowel than the one planned without it	
1	4217	Comparative treatment planning: proton vs. x-ray beams against glioblastoma multiforme	Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, X-Rays	The survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is extremely poor, the 5-year survival rate being almost zero. The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

Comparisons were made with a group of workers with negligible plutonium intakes but similar external gamma doses and with an unexposed control group. Examination of simple translocation frequencies in the three groups indicated a significant difference (P = 0.033), with the higher frequency in the plutonium workers indicating that exposure from plutonium was contributing to the aberration yield. Slightly raised frequencies of both intra-chromosomal and complex aberrations were observed in the plutonium workers in comparison with the comparable external exposure group and the control group but the difference did not reach significance at the P = 0.05 level and there was no variation in the relative frequencies of the different aberration types between the three groups. There was, therefore, no firm indication from this study that either intra-chromosomal or complex aberrations could be used as a specific marker of high LET exposure in workers with historical intakes of plutonium	
0	4218	The potential for irradiation of the lens and cataract induction by incorporated alpha-emitting radionuclides	Alpha Particles, Animals, Cataract/et [Etiology], Dogs, Eye, Germany, Humans, Lens,Crystalline/me [Metabolism], Plutonium, Plutonium/ad [Administration & Dosage], Plutonium/me [Metabolism], Radiation, Radium, Radium/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radium/me [Metabolism]	Data on the uptake and retention of Ra and Pu in ocular tissues are reviewed. These data were used to calculate alpha radiation doses to the lens of the eye for patients injected with 224Ra and for individuals exposed to one annual limit on intake (ALI) per year of 224Ra, 226Ra, 228Ra and 239Pu for a period of 50 y. On the basis of this analysis, it is concluded that the induction of lens opacity should not be the factor limiting intake of any radioisotope of Pu or for 224Ra or 226Ra. However, for 228Ra the dose lies within the range of doses received by 224Ra patients who have developed cataracts

1	4220	Clinical value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for differentiating recurrent or residual brain tumor from delayed cerebral necrosis	Adolescent, Biopsy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Diagnostic Imaging, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm,Residual, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity	PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral necrosis (DN) is a significant risk for brain tumor patients treated with high-dose irradiation. Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors	
0	50	Proton MR spectroscopy of pediatric brain tumors. [Review] [53 refs]	Brain Chemistry, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Child, Humans, Lipids/an [Analysis], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Terminology as Topic	Primary central nervous system tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. Their overall frequency is second only to that of leukemia. Many brain tumors in children are relatively benign and can be successfully treated with surgery or radiation therapy, but progress in treating the malignant forms of these neoplasms lags behind that for leukemias and other solid tumors. This article discusses how MR spectroscopy is used to manage the individualized treatment of children with brain tumors. [References: 53]

The aim is to achieve local tumour control while minimizing long-term effects. In the treatment of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) the most important long-term effects are neuropsychological. Elsewhere orthopaedic long-term effects may compromise function or be cosmetically harmful. Proton therapy has the potential for homogeneous irradiation of the target volume while reducing the magnitude and/or extent of the low dose area outside the target volume. This may be clinically relevant for long-term effects in children. Proton radiotherapy has an established role in the treatment of children with chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. Planning studies have demonstrated the potential for improving the therapeutic ratio for radiotherapy for tumours of the central nervous system by achieving a uniform dose within the target volume while minimizing the severity of neuropsychological sequelae. Clinical experience of proton radiotherapy for children remains limited with potential areas for clinical research	
0	4221	Definitive radiotherapy of prostatic cancer: the Norwegian Radium Hospital's experience (1976-1982)	Aged, Gastrointestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Male, Medical Oncology, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Prognosis, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radium, Research, Survival, Urologic Diseases/et [Etiology]	During the years 1976 to 1982 definitive curatively aimed radiotherapy to the primary tumor was given to 53 patients with prostatic cancer confined to the true pelvis (T0, 2; T1-2, 19; T3, 24; T4, 8; N0, 18; N+, 2; Nx, 33); all patients were of the Mo-category. The pelvic lymph nodes received a total dose of 2 Gy X 25 by means of an anterior and posterior radiation field. The prostatic gland was irradiated by an additional booster dose of 2 Gy X 10 given to a perineal field. Twenty-four patients have relapsed after their prostatic radiotherapy, only three of them within the irradiated area. For the patients with T0-T2 tumors, the 5-year crude survival was 69%, whereas it was only 37% for patients with T3 tumors. Thirty-five patients developed intestinal (26 patients) and/or urogenital (23 patients) radiation side effects. In three patients a colostomy had to be performed owing to rectal stricture or fistula. The poor survival after radiotherapy in the present series is probably due to a high incidence of unrecognized pelvic lymph node metastases. In the future only prostatic cancer patients without pelvic lymph node spread will be considered candidates for definitive radiotherapy. An optimal radiation technique is mandatory in order to avoid major radiotherapy-induced toxicity	
1	4226	Complications of intraoperative radiation therapy	Adult, Aged, Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Rectum, Research	The ability to demonstrate an improvement in therapeutic ratio is critical in assessing new treatment modalities; an evaluation of treatment complications is essential for this purpose. We have studied the severe complications occurring after treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. Four groups of patients were compared: Group 1 (80 patients) had treatment with surgery alone for mobile and resectable tumors; Group 2 (23 patients) had treatment with high dose preoperative irradiation followed by surgical resection for tumors which were fixed to adjacent structures and initially unresectable for cure; Group 3 (24 patients, primary disease) and Group 4 (17 patients, locally recurrent disease) had locally advanced tumors as in Group 2 but were treated with IORT after preoperative irradiation and attempted surgical resection. All but 3 complications occurred within one year of therapy. Severe complications were seen in 16% of patients in Group 1, 35% in Group 2, 21% in Group 3 and 47% in Group 4 (32% in Groups 3 and 4 combined). There was a statistically insignificant increase (p = .10) in the complication rate in all irradiated patients (locally advanced tumors) compared to surgery alone (clinically mobile tumors). These data indicate no increase in severe complications with the use of IORT. If the ongoing studies continue to show improved local control with the use of IORT, expanded use of this modality may be warranted	
1	2152	Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Brain Stem, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Sex Factors, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Time	PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor was located in the parotid gland in 59%, submandibular gland in 14%, oral cavity in 23%, and elsewhere in 5%. In 386 of 498 patients surgery was combined with radiotherapy, with a median dose of 62 Gy. Median delay between surgery and radiotherapy was 6 weeks. In the postoperative radiotherapy group, adverse prognostic factors prevailed. Elective radiotherapy to the neck was given in 40%, with a median dose of 50 Gy. Primary radiotherapy (n = 40) was given for unresectable disease or M(1), with a dose range of 28-74 Gy. RESULTS: Postoperative radiotherapy improved 10-year local control significantly compared with surgery alone in T(3-4) tumors (84% vs. 18%), in patients with close (95% vs. 55%) and incomplete resection (82% vs. 44%), in bone invasion (86% vs. 54%), and perineural invasion (88% vs. 60%). Local control was not correlated with interval between surgery and radiotherapy. No dose-response relationship was shown. Postoperative radiotherapy significantly improved regional control in the pN(+) neck (86% vs. 62% for surgery alone). A rating scale for different sites, T stage, and histologic type may be applied to calculate the risk of disease in the neck at presentation, and so indicate the need for elective neck treatment. A marginal dose-response was seen, in favor of a dose > or =46 Gy. A clear dose-response relationship was shown for patients treated with primary radiotherapy. Five-year local control was 50% with a dose of 66-70 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative radiotherapy with a dose of at least 60 Gy is indicated for patients with T(3-4) tumors, incomplete or close resection, bone invasion, perineural invasion, and pN(+). In unresectable tumors, a dose of at least 66 Gy is advisable

Total radiation doses delivered were 50 Gy for the postoperative group and 50 to 66 Gy for the group receiving only radiation using a 60Co single portal with or without wedged paired or single electron portal boost. Actuarial five-year survivals after radiation therapy were 55% for the postoperative group and 26% for radiation only group (p = 0.0004). The local control rates for the postoperative group were 83% for adenocarcinoma, 81% for adenoid cystic carcinoma, 83% for mucoepidermoid carcinoma and 62% for squamous cell carcinoma. Corresponding figures for the radiation only group were 40% for adenocarcinoma, 38% for adenoid cystic carcinoma and 33% for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conventional irradiation techniques continue to play an important role because they offer superior local control for postoperative patients with carcinoma of the major salivary glands. However, the local control rates for the radiation only group were only 30 to 40%, so that new irradiation modalities such as provided by a high LET machine are needed for these patients

As they are exposed to cosmic rays, especially ions with high linear energy transfer (LET), it is necessary to estimate the doses they receive. The most sensitive biological dosimetry used is based on the quantification of radiation-induced chromosome damage to human lymphocytes. After the space missions ANTARES (1992) and ALTAIR (1993), we performed cytogenetic analysis of blood samples from seven astronauts who had spent from 2 weeks to 6 months in space. After 2 or 3 weeks, the X-ray equivalent dose was found to be below the cytogenetic detection level of 20 mGy. After 6 months, the biological dose greatly varied among the astronauts, from 95 to 455 mGy equivalent dose. These doses are in the same range as those estimated by physical dosimetry (90 mGy absorbed dose and 180 mSv equivalent dose). Some blood cells exhibited the same cytogenetic pattern as the 'rogue cells' occasionally observed in controls, but with a higher frequency. We suggest that rogue cells might result from irradiation with high-LET particles of cosmic origin. However, the responsibility of such cells for the long-term effects of cosmic irradiation remains unknown and must be investigated

The first group consisting of 19 patients was submitted to a combined percutaneous and interstitial treatment, the other six patients were initially treated only by interstitial therapy because of severe complications observed in the meantime. After bilateral pelvic staging lymphadenectomy, permanent iodine-125 seeds were implanted into the patients of stage T1, T2, early T3, and pN0-1, in case of microscopic lymph node manifestation without capsular perforation also into patients of stage pN2 and pN4. Eight weeks later the patients received a moving beam irradiation with 10 MV photons at the linear accelerator. The centre of the prostate was faded out by a specially constructed H absorber in such a way that the prescribed target dose of 36 Gy in four weeks to the 90%-isodose was only applied to a spherical surface around the implant. One patient died perioperatively from an embolism due to phlebothrombosis of the thigh. 22 out of the other 24 patients are in complete remission, one patient had a local recurrence in the right seminal vesicle which appeared 28 months after primary therapy, and one patient developed skeletal metastases. The objective side effects and late complications of our combined treatment are considerable with respect to their incidence as well as their severity: a slight or medium radioproctitis was found after a latent period of one to two years in 28% (5/18) of cases, after a latent time of about 1 1/2 to two years another 28% (5/18) developed subsequently to a proctitis an urethral stricture and an ulcer situated on the anterior rectum wall facing the prostate, and four patients presented finally a prostato-rectal fistula

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

This is the first multivariate study related to liver cancer among Mayak workers. The study was performed using the nested, case-control approach and includes 44 cases of malignant liver tumors diagnosed from 1972 to 1999, and 111 matched controls. Adjusted odds ratio (OR(ad)) was evaluated relative to a group of workers with alpha radiation doses to liver (D(alpha)) < 2.0 Gy. Dose estimates of D(alpha) > 2.0 Gy (corresponding (239)Pu body burden estimates >20.4 kBq) were significantly associated (p < 0.003) with the occurrence of hemangiosarcomas (HAS) but only marginal significance (0.05 < p < 0.1) was found for hepatocellular cancers (HCC). The ORad for HAS was 41.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6, 333] for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-5.0 Gy and was 62.5 (7.4, 500) for a group with D(alpha) > 5.0-16.9 Gy. The attributable risk (AR) was calculated as 82%. For HCC, O(Rad) was estimated as 8.4 (0.8, 85.3; p < 0.07) for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-9.3 Gy. For the indicated group, the AR was 14%. An association with high external gamma-ray doses (D(gamma)) to the total body was revealed for both HCC and for combined liver cancers when dose was treated as a continuous variable. However, we find no evidence that chronic low doses of gamma rays are associated with liver cancer occurrence. Cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) was not associated with either alpha- or gamma-ray exposure. As expected, an association between alcohol abuse and HCC was inferred [O(Rad) = 3.3 (1.2, 9); AR = 41%] but not for CHC or HAS

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2000, 33 patients with head and neck malignancies but no history of surgical resection were treated with 250-MeV protons with or without X-ray irradiation. This study retrospectively evaluated local control, survival, and treatment sequelae of these patients. The median total target dose using protons with or without X-rays was 76 Gy (range: 42-99 Gy) and the median proton dose per fraction 2.8 Gy (range: 1.5-6.0 Gy). RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival and local control rates were 44% and 74%, respectively. One (3%) and six patients (18%) suffered from treatment-related acute and late toxicity > grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria). One patient with a history of radiotherapy suffered from acute toxicity > grade 3. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy appeared to offer high local control rates with few toxicities relative to conventional radiotherapy. However, late toxicity was seen in areas where large radiation doses had been given

METHODS: Twenty males and 6 females were submitted to external beam therapy with 4-6 MV X-rays and received 60-70 Gy in fractions of 180 cGY to 200 cGy per day, 5 days a week. Radiation therapy technique was two posterior oblique portals and a single anterior field at 100 cm SAD. After 4500 cGy portals were coned down, holding the spinal cord dose below 4500 cGy. RESULTS: Global response to therapy was 73.1%. Median survival was 11 months. The 2-year survival rate was 12.5% in patients with lesions smaller than 5 cm and 5.5% for those with lesions greater than 5 cm. Patients with grade 2 dysphagia had a median survival of 16 months, those with grade 1, 11 months and 2 patients with grade 0, 4 and 9 months. In all patients mild to moderate esophagitis was observed. Two patients developed esophagotracheal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusively radiotherapy cannot be considered the treatment of choice in III stage patients. Primary chemoradiotherapy may emerge as the treatment of choice for cancer of the esophagus

The investigated parameters were leaf width in the MLC, leaf transmission, related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. Seven head-and-neck patients with stage T1-T3N0-N2cM0 oropharyngeal cancer were studied. For each patient nine plans were made with a different set of linac/MLC parameters. The plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) v7.6c and PLATO RTS v2.6.4, ITP v1.1.8. A hypothetical ideal linac/MLC was introduced to investigate the influence of one parameter at a time without interaction of other parameters. When any of the three parameters was increased from the ideal set-up values (leaf width 2.5 mm, transmission 0%, penumbra 3 mm), the mean dose to the parotid glands increased, given the same tumour coverage. The largest increase was found for increasing leaf transmission. The investigation showed that by changing more than one parameter of the ideal linac/MLC set-up, the increase in the mean dose was smaller than the sum of dose increments for each parameter separately. As a reference to clinical practice, we also optimized the plans of the seven patients with the clinically used Elekta SLi 15, equipped with a standard MLC with a leaf width of 10 mm. As compared to the ideal linac, this resulted in an increase of the average dose to the parotid glands of 5.8 Gy

Among the 4 eligible randomized studies including non-small-cell lung cancer patients in complete remission of stage II (N1) disease, none demonstrated a significant advantage on survival. In addition, some of these studies disclosed an apparently deleterious effect after postoperative radiotherpy. Although the modalities and the technical quality of radiotherapy and surgical resection were different for the different studies or within a given study, or in some of the older studies even obsolete, and although the precision of the outcome evaluation can be criticized, there is currently no argument for proposing postoperative radiotherapy as a routine systematic practice with conventional methods of bidimensional dosimetric planification after complete surgical resection with good quality mediastinal node dissection for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with stage II (N1) disease. However, the contribution of postoperative radiotherpy with sufficient means for performing tridimensional conformational radiotherapy with individual optimization of computerized dosimetric planification taking into account the residual respiratory function after surgery remains to be evaluated in randomized prospective studies with rigorous control of the technical quality of the surgical resection and the radiotherapy and a precise statistical analysis of the locoregional and distant events in case of incomplete surgical resection and in more advanced stage disease (parietal T3, N0, stage III N2)

METHODS: 54 patients after with malignant brain tumor (44 cases of glioblastoma, 10 other high-grade gliomas) were examined post-surgically in a total of 140 proton MRS examinations in the course of radiotherapy and in follow-up controls. Fast SI acquisition was performed as single-slice or double-slice TSI sequence with 32 x 32 phase encodings within 11 or 15 minutes, respectively. SVS with TR/TE 2000/272 ms yielded relative metabolite ratios, and in 15 patients the time courses of the absolute concentrations of brain metabolites were also determined. RESULTS: In the group of 44 patients that could be tracked by MRS until therapy completion, TSI localized in 23 patients a persistent or newly arisen distinct choline accumulation indicating residual or recurrent tumor after radiation therapy. In all these cases MRS diagnosis was confirmed histologically or by short-term follow-up. However, in 6 of 15 patients showing a normal choline pattern in the TSI acquisition, tumor recurrence appeared within three months. SVS provided early recognition of recurrent tumor when detecting characteristic alterations of metabolite concentrations oin therapy follow-up. CONCLUSION: TSI and SVS represent complementary MRS techniques and are able to diagnose tumor recurrence early and unambiguously in cases where focal choline accumulation is detected

Analysis of combined data from the 13 patients revealed statistically significant improvement in 5 clinical indicators of disease activity at the end of TLI and 6 and 12 months later, accompanied by T4-specific immunosuppression. Management considerations resulted in the introduction of prednisone therapy in 5 patients, methotrexate in 4, and azathioprine in 1 during the interval of 8-12 months post-TLI. Herpes zoster occurred in 5 patients prior to the initiation of this additional therapy. These data indicate that, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a TLI dose of 2,000 cGy is sufficient to produce measurable benefit that lasts for 6 months, and that the improvement can be maintained at 12 months by the use of prednisone and methotrexate

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. RESULTS: At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum. With the use of small-angle lateral-oblique fields in 3D-CPT and IMPT, the rectal V70 was reduced by up to 35% compared with the standard lateral configuration, whereas the bladder V70 increased by less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In the range higher than 60 Gy/CGE, IMRT achieved significantly better sparing of the bladder, whereas rectal sparing was similar with 3D-CPT and IMRT. Dose to healthy tissues in the range lower than 50% of the target prescription was substantially lower with proton therapy

METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 32 patients underwent surgical resection for suspected progression of brain metastases from a cohort of 245 patients with brain metastases treated with GKR. Postradiosurgery MRI surveillance was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after GKR. In some cases, additional MRI scanning with spectroscopy or perfusion (MRS/P) was used to aid differentiation of radiation change from tumor progression. The decision to perform neurosurgical resection was based on MRI or clinical evidence of lesion progression among patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more and absent or stable systemic disease. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (32 out of 245) of patients and 6% (38 out of 611) of lesions required surgical resection after GKR. The median time from GKR to surgical resection was 8.6 months (range, 1.7-27.1 mo). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival from time of GKR was 97, 78, and 47% for the resected patients and 65, 40, and 19% for the nonresected patients (P < 0.0001). The two-year survival rate of patients requiring two resections after GKR was 100% compared with 39% for patients undergoing one resection (P = 0.02). The median survival of resected patients was 27.2 months (range, 7.0-72.5 mo) from the diagnosis of brain metastases, 19.9 months (range, 5.0-60.7 mo) from GKR, and 8.9 months (range, 0.2-53.1 mo) from surgical resection. Tumor was found in 90% of resected specimens and necrosis alone in 10%. MRS/P studies were performed in 15 resected patients. Overall, MRS/P predicted tumor in 11 lesions, confirmed pathologically in nine lesions, and necrosis alone was found in two. The MRS/P predicted necrosis alone in three, whereas pathology revealed viable tumor in two and necrosis in one lesion. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of progressive brain metastases after GKR in selected patients leads to a meaningful improvement in survival rates. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MRS/P in the postradiosurgery surveillance of brain metastases	
0	2160	Dependence of linac output on the switch rate of an intensity-modulated tomotherapy collimator	Boston, England, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Time, Travel, Universities	The electro-mechanical, multivane intensity modulated collimator ("MIMiC") slit collimator with 40 vanes has been applied in the delivery of inversely planned sequential tomotherapy to over 4,000 patients. The collimator is binary in that each vane switches between fully open or closed status. Resulting beamlet patterns provide the intensity distributions imparting dose to the patient. The bouncing and damping of vanes at the two ends of their travel cause transient dose perturbations near and at the borders of the treatment field. These perturbations are not explicitly modeled by the planning system. Clinical beamlet profiles and output factors may then differ from those in the planning system and as a function of the vane switch period. A mechanical model of vane switching was developed to describe this dependency. Dose output and distribution of seven simple vane patterns with different switch times were measured with ionization chambers and radiographic films in polystyrene and anthropomorphic phantoms. Linac output dependence on switch time relative to vane open time was determined for four intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) patients from measurements of an ionization chamber embedded in a cylindrical polystyrene phantom. Results demonstrate output dependence on switch time and, accordingly, on the servo mechanism for monitor units, arc length, dose rate, and gantry speed. In conclusion, the output dependence borders on clinical significance-improvements to collimator, dose calculation, commissioning, and quality assurance (QA) are suggested

DESIGN: Noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a series of 63 patients (76 eyes) with choroidal metastases treated with proton beam therapy between December 1989 and September 2000. METHODS: Patients were treated with 2 fractions of 14 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) (CGE = proton Gy x relative biological effectiveness 1.1), each using a nonoperative "light-field" technique. Ophthalmologic follow-up was available for 46 patients (55 eyes), with a mean follow-up time of 10 months. The medical record or the Social Security Death Index was used to obtain survival status, which was available in 94% of cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor regression, recurrence, treatment-associated complications, and visual acuity were evaluated by ophthalmologic examination and ultrasonography. Eye retention and length of survival also were assessed. RESULTS: At the time of ocular diagnosis, 49 patients reported a history of a primary cancer. Median survival time after ocular diagnosis was 16 months through May 2003. Most choroidal metastases were dome shaped (62%) and located at the posterior pole (95%). Mean tumor height was approximately 3.5 mm, and serous retinal detachment was seen in 63% of cases. Eighty-four percent of treated tumors regressed completely within 5 months of treatment, and none of these recurred. Retinal detachment resolved in 82% of patients within 3.8 months after treatment, and visual acuity was preserved or improved in 47% of the patients. Complications occurred in 56% of cases and included madarosis, keratitis, dry eye syndrome, cataract, neovascular glaucoma, chorioretinal atrophy, radiation papillopathy, and radiation maculopathy. None of the treated eyes required enucleation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation is a useful therapeutic approach for choroidal metastases; it allows retention of the globe, achieves a high probability of local tumor control, and helps to avoid pain and visual loss. Although complications occur in most cases, many of these are minor and are not associated with a change in function. This modality is accurate and efficient, because it only entails 2 treatment fractions and does not require surgery for tumor localization

Gamma-ray radiation was used for comparison. The results of standard colony formation assay showed that the survival fraction of each cell line decreased in an LET-dependent manner. The results of other direct cytotoxic assays, dye exclusion test, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, also displayed a similar relationship between the cytotoxic effect of carbon beams and LET. The maximum values of the cell death index (CDI) were 50.2% in A172 and 37.5% in TK1, both obtained on day 7 after exposure to carbon beams of 80 keV/microm. Apoptosis was observed only on days 4 and 7 after carbon beam irradiation, with maximum values of 7% in A172 and 4.5% in TK1, and the induction of apoptosis after high-LET radiation could be p53-independent. This indicated that a combination of multiple assays to detect cell death was important in evaluating the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, because this approach could more precisely reflect the clinical effectiveness of radiotherapy

[Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver/pp [Physiopathology], Male, Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Science, Universities	Seventy-five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were treated with proton beams from 1983-1993 at the Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. For the purpose of confirming the feasibility of proton therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, we investigated the influence of proton therapy on liver function and also tried to evaluate the possibility of optimization using dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. The results indicated that proton therapy did not cause clinically symptomatic damage in liver function and the only notable change after proton therapy was the transient increase of transminase. DVH analysis showed that this transient increase of transaminase was well correlated to the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). These results indicate that localized high dose radiation using proton beams is feasible for the treatment of liver cancers and optimization of this treatment may be possible using DVH analysis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site	
0	4277	Effect of balloon occluded arterial infusion of anticancer drugs on the prognosis of cervical cancer treated with radiation therapy	Actuarial Analysis, Age Factors, Aged, Balloon Dilatation, Bone Marrow, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Incidence, Infusions,Intra-Arterial/is [Instrumentation], Infusions,Intra-Arterial/mt [Methods], Japan, Methods, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radium, Rectum, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Urinary Bladder, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The effect of local injection of anticancer drugs by balloon catheter, i.e., balloon occluded arterial infusion (BOAI), on the prognosis of cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy were retrospectively estimated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-five patients with cervical cancer (Stage I-IV) treated by irradiation were included in the study. Among the 65 cases, 2 were in Stage I, 13 in Stage II, 40 in Stage III, and 10 in Stage IV. Patients who received surgical resection were excluded. Thirty-nine patients received BOAI and 44 received brachytherapy. Twenty-six patients were not indicated for BOAI because of insufficient renal function, hepatic complications, hematological complications, and refusal from the patients. Cisplatin (0.9-1.7 mg/kg), Adriamycin (0.7-0.9 mg/kg), and Pepleomycin (0.4-0.6 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously into the bilateral internal iliac arteries by BOAI. External irradiation was given by 10 MV x-ray. Total dose administered to the regional lymph nodes by the external irradiation was 48.3 +/- 8.7 Gy. Radium was used at brachytherapy. The dose delivered by the brachytherapy at point A was 45.3 +/- 14.9 Gy. Patients without brachytherapy received 26.1 +/- 19.1 Gy of boost irradiation by the external photon beam. The survival probabilities of the patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates of the Stage III patients with and without BOAI were 53 +/- 13% and 24 +/- 18%, respectively (p = 0.036). By multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model, stage and BOAI were selected as significant predictors of the prognosis. Transient bone marrow suppression was observed in about half of the patients with BOAI. No significant increase of the incidence of the late radiation damage by BOAI in rectum or in urinary bladder was observed. CONCLUSION: Balloon occluded arterial infusion of anticancer drugs may improve the prognosis of the patients with cervical cancer without increasing the incidence of the late radiation damage. A larger scale prospective randomized study is desired

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis	
1	4278	[Field localization and verification system for proton beam radiotherapy in deep-seated tumors]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Humans, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skin, Universities	It has been recognized that, for precise localization and verification of radiation fields, a marking drawn on the skin surface is not entirely reliable because its position relative to bony structures or internal organs is not stationary. This is especially true when treating deep-seated tumors located below the clavicle. In proton beam radiotherapy at the University of Tsukuba, we ristrict the margins around the target volume. Therefore, special care in field localization and verification is needed, and we make it a rule to take X-ray pictures on each treatment day. To accomplish this, we have developed a localize-and-verify system by using fluoroscopic techniques and combining it with a real-time digital image processing device. This allows for the formation of a digital image of the proton field and storage it in the optic disc. By using this system as well as verification films, filed placement errors were measured in 10 patients with deep-seated tumors. Out of a total of 190 localizations, 22% exhibited a field placement error of more than 5 mm, where patient positioning and field localization were done by using skin drawings aligned with laser beams. This result strongly suggests the necessity for daily localization and verification of radiation fields, as is being done by us, for precision in the execution of proton beam radiation therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1983 proton radiotherapy using 250 MeV proton beams produced by a booster synchrotron of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics has been carried out at Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. As of September 1990, a total of 147 patients received a partial or full treatment with proton beams with curative intent; 92 patients (63%) were treated with proton beams alone and 55 patients (37%) with combined photon and proton beams. There were 91 males and the mean age was 61.8 years old. The follow-up observation period ranged from 10 to 97 months. With regard to a total tumor dose, nearly 80% of patients received 70 Gy or more and 53% received 80 Gy or more. While dose-fractionations used depended upon tumor sites, the large majority of patients received substantially high radiation doses in terms of larger total doses (> 70 Gy) and larger fraction sizes (> 2.5 Gy) than those traditionally used. This fractionation regimen has been used because of limited availability of the accelerator or a shortage of machine time (27-30 weeks/year, 3-3.5 hr/day), and also by the expectation that the superior dose distribution possible with protons will permit administration of high radiation doses without increasing morbidities. In connection with this, we have determined the target volume by setting margins around the tumor boundary as practically small as possible, ranging from 5 to 10 mm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current trial has been based on a site and dose searching program, hence a wide variety of tumor sites including the aerodigestive organs has been treated. So far, our judgment is that proton therapy has proven of potential advantage in treatment of the lung, esophageal, liver, uterine cervix, prostate, and head and neck malignancies; and of possible value in treatment of high-grade gliomas, and gastric, urinary bladder, and pediatric tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy

In addition, heavy-ions are high-LET radiations and have increased biological effectiveness when compared with photons or protons. The potential indications for them are those diseases which are usually hard to cure with conventional radiations. At present there are 17 operating facilities world-wide for proton therapy, which in Japan is being conducted at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) and Tsukuba University (PMRC). Currently, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in USA and the National Cancer Institute East Hospital in Japan are building a hospital-based proton facility, both of them will have a fixed energy cyclotron (230MeV). New plans for commencing proton therapy are also proposed by many other institutions in the world. As with heavy-ion therapy, clinical trials have been carried out since 1994 using carbon-ions generated by HIMAC (Heavy-ion medical accelerator in Chiba) at NIRS. The HIMAC is the world's only heavy-ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. The Hyogo prefecture has just decided to build a similar ion therapy facility. As of February 1997, a total of 230 patients were treated in carbon-ion Phase I/II studies at NIRS. So far, carbon-ions appear to be effective in such cases as locally advanced tumors and non-squamous tumors. [References: 18]

This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

According to the Borrmann classification based on X ray findings, Type 1 was found in 3 patients, Type 2 in 5, Type 3 in 40, and Type 4 in 15. Twelve patients could not be classified. The histological type was papillary adenocarcinoma in 7 patients, tubular adenocarcinoma in 23, mucinous carcinoma in 6, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in 14, signet ring cell carcinoma in 12 and others in 13. The site of remote metastasis in 19 patients was Virchow's lymph node in 8 patients, Douglas pouch in 3, liver and lung in 2 each and others in 4. All patients were treated by a either telecobalt 60 unit or a linear accelerator using 6 Mv photon and the total dose to primary lesion was 4000 cGy in 5 weeks to 7000 cGy in 8-9 weeks. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 6 patients or 8.0%, partial response (PR) in 46 or 61.3%, and no change (NC) in 23 or 30.7%. The response rate based on the sum of CR and PR was about 70%. The 50% survival period in months was 26.5, 7.3, and 3.2, respectively for patients with CR, PR, and NC. For the response of advanced gastric cancer to chemotherapy in the National Cancer Center Hospital, the combined use of UFT and Mitomycin C gave the highest rate, 46%. As for as local response is concerned, the response rate to radiation was 70%, a better result than that of chemotherapy alone

In the conventional method, patients must hold their expiration during CT scanning. The phase of holding expiration is different from the end-expiration phase. This results in difference of anatomical location in the body between CT scanning and the respiration-gated irradiation. For the sake of highly-accurate irradiation, a respiration gated CT scanning system is introduced. In case of natural respiration, it has been difficult to achieve the gated CT scanning because a stable period of end-expiratory is not so long as CT scanning time (1 second in our case). In this study, we developed a guided respiration method, which leads a patient to maintain the end-expiratory phase during required time. The respiration gated CT scanning is performed by using this. The phase of the acquired CT image can be approximated to that of respiration-gated irradiation

Surgery and chemotherapy have also been used either before, after, or during radiation therapy, aiming at further improvement of local control of cancer. Intraoperative irradiation, which was firstly developed in Japan, has been applied for treatment of cancers arising from stomach, pancreas and the tumors requiring further improvement of dose distributions in the target volume. Particle radiation therapy using fast neutrons and protons is in under clinical trial in order to evaluate the role of dose distribution as well as biological effect in radiation therapy influencing upon local control of the tumor

At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, patient treatment with the 70 MeV proton beam began in November 1979, and 29 patients were treated through December 1984. Of 11 patients who received protons only, 9 have had local control of the tumor. Two of the 9 patients, suffering from recurrent tumor after radical photon beam irradiation, developed complications after proton treatment. In the patients treated with photons or neutrons followed by proton boost, tumors were controlled in 12 of 18 patients (66.6%), and no complications were observed in this series. Malignant melanoma could not be controlled with the proton beam. A spot-beam-scanning system for protons has been effectively used in the clinical trials to minimize the dose to the normal tissues and to concentrate the dose in the target volume. At the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center, University of Tsukuba, treatment with a vertical 250 MeV proton beam was begun in April 1983, and 22 patients were treated through February 1984. Local control of the tumor was observed in 14 of 22 patients (63.6%), whereas there was no local control in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. There have been no severe complications in patients treated at PARMS. The results suggest that local control of tumors will be better with proton beams than with photon beams, whereas additional modalities are required to manage radioresistant tumors

The results of clinical trials with fast neutrons have shown that carcinoma of the salivary gland and the prostate and Pancoast tumor of the lung were indications for fast neutron therapy, and that the patients suffering from osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma had indications for fast neutrons when fast neutrons were combined with surgery. Neither carcinoma of the pancreas nor glioblastoma multiforme had indications because of complications of normal tissues. High LET radiation therapy will be evaluated by using heavy ions characterized by Bragg peak combined with biological effects

Fast neutrons, 30 MeV d-Be, were used to treat patients who had malignant melanoma in order to confirm the biological effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation for tumor control. Seventy-two patients suffering from malignant melanoma participated in the clinical trials with fast neutrons between November 1975 and December 1986. Of 72 patients, 45 had melanoma of the skin, 20 had melanoma of the head and neck, and seven had choroidal melanoma. Five-year survival rate of the patients who had previously untreated melanoma of the skin was 61% and for patients who received postoperative irradiation, it was 35.7% whereas no patients who had recurrent tumor survived over 4 years. Of 22 patients who had melanoma of the skin, stage I, local control in four cases was achieved by irradiation alone, whereas local control was achieved in 17 of 18 patients who required salvage surgery after fast-neutron therapy. The results of pathological studies performed with specimens obtained from salvage surgery have shown that melanoma cells growing in intradermal tissue are radio-resistant, compared with cells growing in intraepidermal tissue. This might suggest that melanoma cells acquire radioresistance when the connective tissue is involved. Five-year survival rate of the patients who had locally advanced melanoma of the head and neck, previously untreated, was 15.4%. Radiation therapy with accelerated protons was suitable for patients suffering from choroidal melanoma

Results of the studies showed that prognosis of the patients treated with radiations depend strongly on length of tumor as well as on invasion of tumor cells into the adventitia of the esophagus. It was concluded that patients suffering from carcinoma of the esophagus less than 8 cm length are indicated for particle radiations

At NIRS, 2,129 patients were treated with d(30 MeV)+Be neutrons between 1975 and 1994. There were 274 patients referred for the treatment with P(50.5 MeV)+Be neutrons at KCCH during the period of 1986 through 1992. Unfortunately, fast neutron therapy performed at IMS was discontinued in 1991, where 458 patients had been treated with d(14 MeV)+Be neutrons since 1976. At NIRS, a vertical beam with multileaf collimator system was used for treatment of patients referred. The results showed that local control rates were 79% (19/24), 53% (14/26), and 89.3% (50/56) for carcinoma of the salivary gland, osteogenic sarcoma and carcinoma of the prostate, while complications for those were found to be 8.8, 8.3 and 17.8%, respectively. In the treatment of carcinoma of the lung, results were better for patients with adenocarcinoma than those with squamous cell carcinoma. Of 32 patients suffering from Pancoast tumor, 14 achieved local control, whereas 2 of 32 patients developed complications. On the other hand, salvage surgery was required in the treatment of malignant melanoma. In the treatment of malignant glioma, dose localization has to be improved in the target area to confirm local control. Experiences performed at KCCH have shown that, of 53 patients suffering from unresectable primary or recurrent rectal carcinomas, 28 achieved local control. It was concluded from the experiences with fast neutrons in Asian countries that adenocarcinomas as well as slowly growing tumors are indications for fast neutrons and that dose localization has to be improved in order to advance high LET radiation therapy. Clinical trials with 70 MeV protons started at NIRS in 1979, where the aim of study has been focused on treatment of choroidal melanoma, whereas, at Tsukuba University, 250 MeV protons have been used in the treatment of tumors deeply seated. Based on experiences of fast neutrons and protons, clinical trials with heavy ions initiated at NIRS in October 1994. Clinical studies with high LET radiations will be performed by using heavy ions in order to pursue indications of particle radiation therapy

[Review] [80 refs]	Age Distribution, Alpha Particles, Apoptosis, Bone Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Breast, Cell Death, Cell Division, Cell Proliferation, DNA, France, Genome, Humans, Incidence, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Mutation, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/mo [Mortality], Probability, Radiation, Skin Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Skin Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Smoking/ae [Adverse Effects], Survivors	Human data strongly suggest that small doses or low concentrations of genotoxic agents cause only a relatively small number of human cancers. They emphasize the role of promotion, in particular that associated with cell proliferation. There is therefore a qualitative difference between high doses of genotoxic agents which provoke cell death and a compensatory increase in cell division, and low doses which do not. During the promotion phase, human data demonstrate the importance of induced genetic instability and defects in apoptosis as well as that of cell immortalization which play a main role for the accumulation in a cell genome of several specific lesions. Carcinogenesis is a complex process in which initial mutations do not appear to be a limiting or crucial step. This view is supported by the paramount influence of age on the induction by radiation of thyroid and breast cancer. It is also compatible with practical thresholds observed in subjects whose bones or liver were exposed to alpha-emitters, as well as with the curvilinearity in the leukemia incidence dose-response in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The linear no threshold model assumes that: 1) the probability of DNA lesion repair is constant whatever the dose and, hence, the number of lesions provoked in the same cell and the surrounding cells; 2) the probability for a damaged cell to evolve toward an invasive cancer is not influenced by the possible promotional effect of further irradiation or induced tissue proliferation, nor the control exerted by surrounding cells. These assumptions deserve a critical analysis. [References: 80]

One such method is to use positron emission tomography (PET), which takes advantage of the nuclear reactions that take place between protons and nuclei in the tissue. The dominant nuclear reaction in human muscle tissue involves oxygen nuclei and produces radioactive oxygen-15. Oxygen-15 decays through positron emission, and it is these positrons that go on to annihilate that produce the signal used in the PET technique. Finding the distribution of annihilation points, however, is not analogous to finding the proton dose distribution. The oxygen-15 and positrons travel finite distances within the tissue, blurring the detected PET distribution from the desired proton distribution. Through Monte Carlo modelling, an analysis of the differences between the positron, oxygen-15 and proton distributions has been made. The program SRIM 2003 was used to find the correlation between the three distributions within simulated muscle tissue. Results show that the distal edge of the proton Bragg peak correlates with the detectable positron distribution, which is a section of the dose distribution of interest due to the steep dose gradient and position of adjacent critical structures

Diode and thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD) measurements were carried out for the linear accelerators of 6 MV photon beams. ESTRO in vivo dosimetry protocols were followed in the determination of midline doses from measurements of entrance and exit doses. Of the fields monitored by diodes, the maximum absolute deviation of measured midline doses from planned target doses was 8%, with the mean value and the standard deviation of -1.0 and 2.7%. If planned target doses were calculated using radiological water equivalent thicknesses rather than patient geometric thicknesses, the maximum absolute deviation dropped to 4%, with the mean and the standard deviation of 0.7 and 1.8%. For in vivo dosimetry monitored by TLDs, the shift in mean dose remained small but the statistical precision became poor

The radiation quality used was electron beams with an energy of about 12 MeV. The overall treatment time varied between 4 and 6 weeks. The two schedules were also compared for an overall treatment time of 10 weeks, with a rest period of 3 weeks after 4 weeks of irradiation, followed by another 3 weeks of treatment. With 5 to 6 weeks irradiation, daily fractions resulted in a significantly more pronounced skin erythema (p less than 0.05) than twice-a-week fractions, corresponding to about 10% in terms of absorbed dose. With 4 weeks irradiation and split-course therapy, the acute reactions were identical with both schedules. We interpret these findings as indicating a radiation-induced accelerated repopulation of the basal cells in the epidermis, with a fairly abrupt onset after 4 weeks. The higher effect after more frequent fractions of smaller size would be expected from a sensitizing effect of redistribution. In conclusion, the overall treatment time is of importance for establishment of iso-effect relationships for acutely responding tissues. The implication is that different fractionation parameters used in models to predict equivalent radiation effects of different fractionation schedules also vary significantly with the overall treatment time

The radiation used was electron beams at 12-13 MeV. We have previously reported that the overall treatment time was of importance for establishment of iso-effect relationships for the acute skin erythema. In this paper we present the degree of telangiectasia after 5 years. Generally, a more pronounced late reaction was found after twice-a-week fractionation than was predicted from the acute reactions. The findings imply that the cumulative radiation effect (CRE) formula has to be modified for both acute and late reactions in certain clinical situations. The main conclusion is that the iso-effect relationship varies significantly over the dose range used in clinical radiotherapy. In the dose range of 30 fractions between 1.6 and 2.1 Gy in 6 weeks, the slope of the curve for iso-effect dose versus number of fractions varies between 0.26 and 0.35, the beta/alpha-ratios between 0.22 and 0.37 Gy-1 and the RBE 2 Fractions/week/5 Fractions/week between 1.97 and 1.82

METHODS: Over a 20-year period, 47 patients underwent 72 operative procedures for resection of cranial base chondrosarcomas. Thirty-three patients were previously untreated, whereas 14 patients previously had undergone surgery or radiation. Twenty-three patients had a single operation and 24 underwent staged (more than one) operations because of extensive disease. Patients who underwent subtotal resection also underwent radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Patients were evaluated at follow-up clinically and by imaging studies. RESULTS: Gross total resection was accomplished in 29 (61.7%) patients, and subtotal resection was accomplished in 18 patients (38.3%). The resection was better in patients who underwent a primary operation (gross total resection, 68.8 versus 46.7%) rather than a reoperation. Patients who underwent incomplete resection underwent postoperative radiotherapy, which included proton beam radiotherapy (15.6%), radiosurgery (68%), and fractionated radiation (15.6%). There were no operative deaths. Postoperative complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage, quadriparesis, infections, cranial nerve palsies, etc.) were observed in 10 patients (18%). The follow-up ranged from 2 to 255 months, with an average of 86 months. At the conclusion of study, 36 (76.6%) patients were alive, and 21 (44.7%) patients were alive without disease. Recurrence-free survival was 32% at 10 years in all patients, 42.3% in primary patients and 13.8% in those who underwent reoperation. The Karnofsky performance score was 82.4 +/- 9.8 before surgery, 85 +/- 12.5 at 1 year after surgery, and 85.3 +/- 5.8 at the latest follow-up. Two patients died as a result of radiotherapy complications (malignancy, radiation necrosis). CONCLUSION: Cranial base chondrosarcomas can be managed well by complete surgical resection or by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The study cannot comment about the efficacy of radiotherapy. Approximately half of the patients survived without recurrence at long-term follow-up (>132 mo). The functional status of the surviving patients was excellent at follow-up	
0	4303	A dual computed tomography linear accelerator unit for stereotactic radiation therapy: a new approach without cranially fixated stereotactic frames	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Head, Humans, Japan, Methods, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To perform stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) without cranially fixated stereotactic frames, we developed a dual computed tomography (CT) linear accelerator (linac) treatment unit. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This unit is composed of a linac, CT, and motorized table. The linac and CT are set up at opposite ends of the table, which is suitable for both machines. The gantry axis of the linac is coaxial with that of the CT scanner. Thus, the center of the target detected with the CT can be matched easily with the gantry axis of the linac by rotating the table. Positioning is confirmed with the CT for each treatment session. Positioning and treatment errors with this unit were examined by phantom studies. Between August and December 1994, 8 patients with 11 lesions of primary or metastatic brain tumors received SRT with this unit. All lesions were treated with 24 Gy in three fractions to 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the 80% isodose line, with or without conventional external beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: Phantom studies revealed that treatment errors with this unit were within 1 mm after careful positioning. The position was easily maintained using two tiny metallic balls as vertical and horizontal marks. Motion of patients was negligible using a conventional heat-flexible head mold and dental impression. The overall time for a multiple noncoplanar arcs treatment for a single isocenter was less than 1 h on the initial treatment day and usually less than 20 min on subsequent days. Treatment was outpatient-based and well tolerated with no acute toxicities. Satisfactory responses have been documented. CONCLUSION: Using this treatment unit, multiple fractionated SRT is performed easily and precisely without cranially fixated stereotactic frames

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The FOCAL unit is a combination of a linear accelerator (Linac), CT scanner, X-ray simulator (X-S), and carbon table, and is designed to achieve CT-guided SRT with daily CT positioning followed by immediate irradiation while patients keep reduced shallow respirations. To evaluate intrafractional tumor position stability, 50 lung or liver lesions in 20 patients were checked by repeated CT scanning just before and after irradiation, and the obtained images were compared. RESULTS: There was no case with the intrafractional error judged to be greater than 10 mm. In 68% of cases, the intrafractional positioning errors were negligible (0-5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Using the FOCAL unit, SRT for lung or liver cancers could be performed with intrafractional positioning errors not greater than 10 mm

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

In our department, between January 1995 to January 2001, we treated eleven patients with mycosis fungoides by total body skin electron irradiation to evaluate its influence. According to our knowledge, our department is the only center in Turkey capable of applying total skin electron beam therapy. Total skin electron beam therapy was applied by using the "translational technique". Daily doses (4 Gray) were given in a total of seven fractions according to the conventional fractionation scheme. There were 6 patients with stage I disease, 3 patients with stage II and 2 patients with stage IV disease. Except stage IV patients, we obtained good cutaneous results. According to our observation, in early stage mycosis fungoides total body skin electron irradiation can provide good cutaneous response, but for stage IV only moderate pallation can be obtained

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

On CT the radiation hepatitis appeared as sharply demarcated region of lower attenuation than the adjacent normal liver. The region of radiation hepatitis demonstrated decreased perfusion in the portal venous phase of CTA, and 4 min delayed images following CTA showed increased density or relative increased accumulation of contrast. Magnetic resonance in both cases showed that the area of low density on CT had high signal on the T2-weighted image and had increased water content as determined by proton spectroscopic imaging method

Although there are many reports concerning the tolerance of the CNS, few have examined individual substructures of the brain and fewer still have had detailed dose information. This study has both. A three dimensional planning system was used to develop the combined proton beam/photon beam treatments for 27 patients with skull-base tumors. The cranial nerves and their related nuclei were delineated on the planning CT scans and the radiation dose to each was determined from three dimensional dose distributions. In the 594 CNS structures (22 structures/patient in 27 patients), there have been 17 structures (in 5 patients) with clinically manifest radiation injury, after a mean follow-up time of 74 months (range 40-110 months). From statistical analyses, dose is found to be a significant predictor of injury. Using logistic regression analysis, we find that, for each cranial nerve, at 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) the complication rate is 1% (0.5-3% with 95% confidence) and that the 5% complication rate occurs at 70 CGE (64-81 CGE with 95% confidence). The slope of the dose response curve (at 50%) is 3.2 (2.2-5.4 with 95% confidence). No significant relationship between dose and latency period for nerve injury was found

The improved dose distribution of protons results from their physical characteristics. A total of 965 patients have been treated as of December 31, 1984. Dose is expressed in units of cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) which is the dose in Gy multiplied by the RBE (1.1) for modulated protons relative to 60Co radiation. Sixty-seven patients with chordomas or low-grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull or cervical spine have received proton treatment. Forty-three of these patients have been followed for at least 8 months with a median follow-up of 27 months. The median dose is 69 CGE. The 3-year actuarial local control rate is 89%. Seven patients with gliomas, eight with craniopharyngiomas, and six with meningiomas have also received proton radiation treatments. A total of 615 patients with uveal melanomas have received a median dose of 70 CGE in five fractions. Tumor regression has been seen in 94% with 66% having vision of 20/100 or better

[Review] [23 refs] [Russian]	Chordoma, Head, Humans, Melanoma, Neck, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Sarcoma, Skull, Universities	Investigations in proton beam therapy of cancer patients have been initiated at the Cyclotron Laboratory, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA, since 1974 using a proton beam with the energy of 160 MeV for fractionated irradiation of uveal melanoma (899 cases), chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull (96), sarcoma of the soft tissues and bones (79), prostatic cancer, head and neck tumors, etc. (altogether 1331 patients had been irradiated by June, 1986). To stop a beam in the target computer-assisted three-dimensional design and heterogeneity calculations were performed; computed compensatory boles were produced. Proton beam therapy is used alone or in combination with proton beam irradiation, routine radiotherapy. Areas of particular interest are ocular melanoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull, paraspinal sarcomas. Investigations in the field of proton beam therapy of malignant meningioma, metastases to the paraaortic lymph nodes hold promise. [References: 23]

Protons have favorable physical characteristics which allow the delivery of high doses of radiation to these critically located tumors. The methods employed for these treatments are described. These patients have been followed for at least 17 months and for a median of 34 months. The median tumor dose was 69 CGE (cobalt Gy equivalent): CGE is the dose in proton Gy multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons compared to cobalt-60. The daily dose was 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. For this group the 5-year actuarial local control rate is 82% and disease-free survival rate is 76%. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity has been acceptable

Protons have favorable physical characteristics that yield dose distributions superior to those of photons in certain clinical situations. As of December 31, 1987, 1,678 patients had been treated. Of these, 110 had chordomas or low-grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. The first 68 patients have a minimum follow-up of 17 months. The median dose was 69 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE). (CGE is the dose in proton Gray multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons relative to 60Cobalt.) The actuarial 5-year local control rate is 82%, and the disease-free survival rate is 76%. Thirteen patients with meningiomas have been treated, following subtotal resection. The median dose was 59.4 CGE. With a median follow-up of 26 months, no patient has had tumor progression. In addition, nine patients with gliomas and 12 with craniopharyngiomas have been treated

The development of optimized treatment plans for X-rays and protons followed by a comparative evaluation is one method of selecting tumor sites best suited for proton treatment. The preliminary results of comparative treatment planning for base of skull tumors and carcinoma of the prostate are discussed. These comparisons suggest a clinical gain for proton treatment of tumors in these locations. The clinical experience with fractionated proton treatment of several tumor sites is also discussed. The results of high dose proton treatment of chordomas and low grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull is particularly promising: an actuarial 5-year local control of 78% has been obtained in 50 patients followed for a minimum of 22 months

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

Radiation treatment did not significantly affect the patient's general condition, nor did it interfere with surgical procedure, increase operative blood loss or postoperative lethality. However, the postoperative complication rate was higher in the radiotherapy group (51.9 +/- 6.9%) than in the surgery alone group (39.4 +/- 6.0%) mainly due to increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders in patient older than 55 years of age suffering heart pathology. Radiation treatment assured a higher 5-year survival rate (32.0 +/- 9.2% as compared to 14.2 +/- 5.7%) in squamous-cell lung cancer. The beneficial effect of irradiation was most apparent in cases of central squamous-cell lung cancer with intact regional lymph nodes

The tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density, and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing method

Three regimens of fractionation were used: (1) accelerated fractionation (AF)--(133), 2.5 Gy, 3 days a week, to a total of 47.5--55 Gy; (2) accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF)--(93), 1.25 Gy, daily, to a total of 60-72.5 Gy and standard fractionation (SF)--(149), 2 Gy, daily, to a total of 58-68 Gy. The advantages of AHF were established as regards complete regression rate (54.9% vs. 18.6%--SF and 18.1%--AF; p(0.001), median survival (30.5(2.4 months vs. 18.9 (1%--SF (p = 0.004) and 20.4 (2.4--AF (p = 0.004)), and 3-year survival (36.6% vs. 16.7%--SF (p = 0.005) and 15.5%--AF (p = 0.005). 17.9%, 9.0% (p = 0.11) and 8.1% (p = 0.08) have survived, respectively. Overall survival in the AHF group was superior in stages IIB--III; in stage I, the results were identical. Immediate response to radical radiotherapy appeared the only statistically significant factor of survival (p = 0.005-0.008) in all the groups

Curative resectability was 70% (19/27) with 4 operative deaths (21%). Recurrence rate was 66% after a mean period of 16 months, and the failure pathway was nodal in 53% of the cases. Historical comparison of the data suggests that preoperative irradiation increases the curative resectability rate without changing the early recurrence rate or failure pathway. Tumors with deeper invasion of the esophageal wall, which benefit by preoperative irradiation, are probably related to greater nodal diffusion, which is partly outside of the volume that may be resected or irradiated

Routine one-month follow-up documented disappearance of the tumour in 16 patients, with resolution of the oedema and ventricular shift. Shrinkage of the metastasis occurred in 51 patients. In 9 patients the tumour remained stable, in 7 there was progression of tumour size. Among the patients showing shrinkage of the tumour or unchanged tumour volume, repeated radiosurgery resulted in disappearance of the metastasis in 5 and further shrinkage in 28. In 14 patients routine stereotactic CT follow-up study led to the detection of a new metastasis, again treated with excellent results. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients and radiation necrosis in the target area in 5 patients. Radiosurgery thus proves to be an appropriate alternative to surgery. The versatility of our non-invasive and painless method permits CT staging (which we consider essential) without hospitalization of the patient

Radiotherapy was the primary treatment in 66 patients, actuarial survival was 18% at 5 years and local control 22%. In 22 patients treated with a laryngopharyngectomy and pre- or postoperative radiotherapy, survival was also 18%, but local control was obtained in 51%. No differences in prognosis were demonstrated according to the tumoral stage or nodal status. Metastases were found in 10.5% of irradiated patients and in 14% of patients treated with combined therapy. The frequency of postoperative complications was not increased after surgery for preoperatively irradiated patients. Treatment results in hypopharyngeal cancer remain unfavorable, even with a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Alternative approaches should be actively investigated to improve local control rates such as the modalities currently under study (high LET, new fractionations, combinations with drugs)

Stationary fields at an extended source-skin distance are used with the patient treated in a reclined position. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The relative beam data, absolute dosimetry measurements and the patient setup parameters are presented. The calculations required to correct for patient size are discussed. RESULTS: The technique described uses a six field circumferential cycle, with longitudinally matched fields along the length of the patient. Treatment times are reasonable using the standard dose rate of the machine. The uniformity of the skin dose measured on three patients was found to be comparable to that of other total skin treatment techniques. CONCLUSION: A technique for treating conditions like mycosis fungoides is presented requiring relatively simple supporting dosimetry. No modifications to the unit are required and no sophisticated treatment apparatus is necessary, which makes the technique attractive to smaller Institutions, especially in developing countries, where technical support may be limited

Despite a 3D conformal RT technique and the omission of elective mediastinal fields, three (of ten) patients with inoperable stage 3 NSCLC who were treated with induction chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) followed by RT to 70 Gy, developed symptomatic radiation pneumonitis. In this planning study, the actual treatment plans of all ten patients were compared to plans derived using two beam intensity-modulated (BIM) techniques, for which similar geometrical beam setup parameters were used. In the first technique (BF-BIM), cranial and caudal boost fields were applied in order to allow field length reduction. The second technique (C-BIM) utilised 3-D missing-tissue compensators for all radiation beams. Both BIM techniques resulted in a significant sparing of critical normal tissues and the C-BIM technique was superior in all cases. When compared to the actual RT technique used for treatment, a reduction of 8.1+/-4.7% (1 S.D.) was observed in the mean lung dose for the BF-BIM plan, vs. 20.3+/-5.8% (1 S.D.) for the C-BIM plan. Similar reductions were observed in the percentage of the total lung volume exceeding 20 Gy (V(20)) for these techniques. BIM techniques appear to be a promising tool for enabling radiation dose-escalation and/or intensive concurrent chemo-RT in inoperable lung cancer

In order to minimise the workload related to the quality assurance of the IMRT fields, we have explored the possibility of using a commercially available aSi portal imager for absolute dosimetric verification of the delivery of dynamic IMRT fields. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the basic dosimetric characteristics of an aSi portal imager (aS500, Varian Medical Systems), using an acquisition mode especially developed for portal dose (PD) integration during delivery of a-static or dynamic-radiation field. Secondly, the dose calculation algorithm of a commercially available treatment planning system (Cadplan, Varian Medical Systems) was modified to allow prediction of the PD image, i.e. to compare the intended fluence distribution with the fluence distribution as actually delivered by the dynamic multileaf collimator. Absolute rather than relative dose prediction was applied. The PD image prediction was compared to the corresponding acquisition for several clinical IMRT fields by means of the gamma evaluation method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The acquisition mode is accurate in integrating all PD over a wide range of monitor units, provided detector saturation is avoided. Although the dose deposition behaviour in the portal image detector is not equivalent to the dose to water measurements, it is reproducible and self-consistent, lending itself to quality assurance measurements. Gamma evaluations of the predicted versus measured PD distribution were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria for all clinical IMRT fields, i.e. allowing a dose difference of 3% of the local field dose in combination with a distance to agreement of 3 mm

The German Thorotrast Study comprises 2326 Thorotrast patients and 1890 contemporary matched patients in the control group to be evaluated. 899 Thorotrast patients and 662 controls had clinical and biophysical follow-up examinations every two years since 1969. The recent most important results of the study are: A high excess rate of primary liver cancer (410/2) was observed beginning after the 15th year of exposure. 31% of the tumors are combined with cirrhosis and 6% with other neoplastic diseases. A clear (mean) dose rate effect relationship exists. The tumor frequency depends on the time of exposure or the cumulative dose to the liver respectively and not primarily on the age at injection. The lowest cumulative doses at 10 years before diagnosis of liver cancer were about 2 Gy. Risk estimates for liver cancer after 40 years of exposure are 500 malignant tumors per 10(4) person-Gy for men and 300 for women. A high excess rate exists also for leukaemias (excluding CLL) starting already 5 years after Thorotrast injection (39/4). The lowest cumulative doses to the red bone marrow at time of death were about 0.5 Gy. According to the present result, an excess rate can be expected for carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, oesophagus, larynx, as well as Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, bone sarcomas, plasmacytomas and mesotheliomas

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 1998, 142 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with breast conservative surgery and adjuvant RT. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a boost dose of 15 Gy delivered to the tumor bed either by iridium 192, or a combination of photons and electrons. Cosmetic evaluations were done on a 6-month basis, with a final evaluation at 36 months after RT. The evaluations were done using a panel of global and specific subjective scores, a digitized scoring system using the breast retraction assessment (BRA) measurement, and a patient's self-assessment evaluation. As cosmetic results were graded according to severity, the comparison of boost techniques was done using the ordinal logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. RESULTS: At 36 months of follow-up, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the global subjective cosmetic outcome (OR = 1.40; 95%CI = 0.69-2.85, p = 0.35). Good to excellent scores were observed in 65% of implant patients and 62% of photon/electron patients. At 24 months and beyond, telangiectasia was more severe in the implant group with an OR of 9.64 (95%CI = 4.05-22.92, p < 0.0001) at 36 months. The only variable associated with a worse global cosmetic outcome was the presence of concomitant chemotherapy (OR = 3.87; 95%CI = 1.74-8.62). The BRA value once adjusted for age, concomitant chemotherapy, and boost volume showed a positive association with the boost technique. The BRA value was significantly greater in the implant group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the patient's final self-assessment score between the two groups. Three variables were statistically associated with an adverse self-evaluation: an inferior quadrant tumor localization, postoperative hematoma, and concomitant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial showed that at 36 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in the overall global cosmetic scores between the implant boost group and the photon/electron boost group, telangiectasia was more severe and the BRA value was greater in the implant group	
0	294	Treatment-planning study of prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiotherapy with a Varian Clinac operated without a flattening filter	Algorithms, Feasibility Studies, Femur Head/re [Radiation Effects], Filtration/is [Instrumentation], Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer using photon beams from an accelerator operated without a flattening filter; and to determine potential benefits and drawbacks of using unflattened beams for this type of treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated for 10 patients with early-stage prostate cancer. For each patient, four plans were generated: with and without the flattening filter, at 6 and 18 MV. The prescription dose was 75.6 Gy to 98% of the planning target volume. The number of beams, their orientations, and optimization constraints were the same for all plans. Plans were generated with Eclipse 8.0 (Varian Medical Systems). RESULTS: All the plans developed with unflattened beams were clinically acceptable. In terms of patient dose distributions, plans with unflattened beams were similar to the corresponding plans with flattened beams. Plans with unflattened beams required fewer monitor units (MUs) per plan: on average, by a factor of 2.0 at 6 MV and 2.6 at 18 MV, assuming that removal of the flattening filter was not followed by recalibration of MUs. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically acceptable intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans for prostate cancer can be developed with unflattened beams at both 6 and 18 MV. Dosimetrically, flattened and unflattened beams generated similar treatment plans. The plans with unflattened beams required substantially fewer MUs. The reduction in the number of MUs indicates corresponding reduction in beam-on time and in the amount of radiation outside the target	
1	716	Dosimetric impact of geometric errors due to respiratory motion prediction on dynamic multileaf collimator-based four-dimensional radiation delivery	Fluoroscopy, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Theoretical, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Time Factors	The synchronization of dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) response with respiratory motion is critical to ensure the accuracy of DMLC-based four dimensional (4D) radiation delivery. In practice, however, a finite time delay (response time) between the acquisition of tumor position and multileaf collimator response necessitates predictive models of respiratory tumor motion to synchronize radiation delivery. Predicting a complex process such as respiratory motion introduces geometric errors, which have been reported in several publications. However, the dosimetric effect of such errors on 4D radiation delivery has not yet been investigated. Thus, our aim in this work was to quantify the dosimetric effects of geometric error due to prediction under several different conditions. Conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for a lung patient were generated for anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beam arrangements at 6 and 18 MV energies to provide planned dose distributions. Respiratory motion data was obtained from 60 diaphragm-motion fluoroscopy recordings from five patients. A linear adaptive filter was employed to predict the tumor position. The geometric error of prediction was defined as the absolute difference between predicted and actual positions at each diaphragm position. Distributions of geometric error of prediction were obtained for all of the respiratory motion data. Planned dose distributions were then convolved with distributions for the geometric error of prediction to obtain convolved dose distributions. The dosimetric effect of such geometric errors was determined as a function of several variables: response time (0-0.6 s), beam energy (6/18 MV), treatment delivery (3D/4D), treatment type (conformal/IMRT), beam direction (AP/PA), and breathing training type (free breathing/audio instruction/visual feedback). Dose difference and distance-to-agreement analysis was employed to quantify results. Based on our data, the dosimetric impact of prediction (a) increased with response time, (b) was larger for 3D radiation therapy as compared with 4D radiation therapy, (c) was relatively insensitive to change in beam energy and beam direction, (d) was greater for IMRT distributions as compared with conformal distributions, (e) was smaller than the dosimetric impact of latency, and (f) was greatest for respiration motion with audio instructions, followed by visual feedback and free breathing. Geometric errors of prediction that occur during 4D radiation delivery introduce dosimetric errors that are dependent on several factors, such as response time, treatment-delivery type, and beam energy. Even for relatively small response times of 0.6 s into the future, dosimetric errors due to prediction could approach delivery errors when respiratory motion is not accounted for at all. To reduce the dosimetric impact, better predictive models and/or shorter response times are required

Pretreatment and post-treatment radiographs have been taken with the patient in the treatment position and analyzed to determine the amount of intratreatment movement. Studies of patients in the supine, seated and decubitus positions indicate mean movements of less than 1 mm with a standard deviation of less than 1mm. Patients immobilized in the seated position with a bite block and a mask have a mean movement of about 0.5 mm +/- 0.3 mm (s.d.), and patients immobilized in the supine position with their necks hyperextended for submental therapy evidence a mean movement of about 1.4 mm +/- 0.9 mm (s.d.). With the exception of those used for the decubitus position, the immobilization devices are simply fabricated out of thermoplastic casting materials readily available from orthopedic supply houses. A study of day-to-day reproducibility of patient position using laser alignment and pretreatment radiographs for final verification of position indicates that the initial laser alignment can be used to position a patient within 2.2 mm +/- 1.4 mm (s.d.) of the intended position. These results indicate that rigid immobilization devices can improve the precision of radiotherapy, which would be advantageous with respect to both tumor and normal tissue coverage in certain situations

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions. RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an alpha/beta value of 3.7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated. CONCLUSION: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, a total of 85 patients with vascular lesions have been treated. Of those, 64 patients fulfilled the criteria of having an arteriovenous malformation and sufficient follow-up. The AVMs were grouped by volume: <14 cc (26 patients) and > or =14 cc (38 patients). Treatment was delivered with a fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton beam under stereotactic conditions, using a stereophotogrammetric positioning system. The majority of patients were hypofractionated (2 or 3 fractions), and the proton doses are presented as single-fraction equivalent cobalt Gray equivalent doses (SFEcGyE). The overall mean minimum target volume dose was 17.37 SFEcGyE, ranging from 10.38-22.05 SFEcGyE. RESULTS: Analysis by volume group showed obliteration in 67% for volumes <14 cc and 43% for volumes > or =14 cc. Grade IV acute complications were observed in 3% of patients. Transient delayed effects were seen in 15 patients (23%), becoming permanent in 3 patients. One patient also developed a cyst 8 years after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic proton beam therapy applied in a hypofractionated schedule allows for the safe treatment of large AVMs, with acceptable results. It is an alternative to other treatment strategies for large AVMs. AVMs are likely not static entities, but probably undergo vascular remodeling. Factors influencing angiogenesis could play a new role in a form of adjuvant therapy to improve on the radiosurgical results	
1	1649	A preliminary report of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in limited-stage breast cancers that are conservatively treated.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Arm, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Feasibility Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Italy, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Research, Time, Universities	Local recurrences after breast conserving surgery occur mostly in the quadrant harbouring the primary carcinoma. The main objective of postoperative radiotherapy should be the sterilisation of residual cancer cells in the operative area, while irradiation of the whole breast may be avoided. We have developed a new technique of intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) of a breast quadrant after the removal of the primary carcinoma. A mobile linear accelerator (linac) with a robotic arm is utilised delivering electron beams able to produce energies from 3 to 9 MeV. Through a perspex applicator, the radiation is delivered directly to the mammary gland and to spare the skin from the radiation, the skin margins are stretched out of the radiation field. To protect the thoracic wall, an aluminium-lead disc is placed between the gland and the pectoralis muscle. Different dose levels were tested from 10 to 21 Gy without important side-effects. We estimated that a single fraction of 21 Gy is equivalent to 60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions at 2 Gy/fraction. Seventeen patients received a dose of IORT of 10 to 15 Gy as an anticipated boost to external radiotherapy, while 86 patients received a dose of 17-19-21 Gy intra-operatively as their whole treatment. The follow-up time of the 101 patients varied from 1 to 17 months (mean follow-up time was 8 months). The IORT treatment was very well accepted by all of our patients, either due to the rapidity of the radiation course in cases where IORT was given as the whole treatment or to the shortening of the subsequent external radiotherapy in cases where IORT was given as an anticipated boost. We believe that single dose IORT after breast resection for small mammary carcinomas may be an excellent alternative to the traditional postoperative radiotherapy. However, a longer follow-up is needed for a better evaluation of the possible late side-effects

METHODS: This was a retrospective and multicentric study. First a questionnaire was sent to 4575 French ophthalmologists asking whether they had established a diagnosis of uveal melanoma during 1992, and if so, to describe the tumor and its management. Then the patients files were reviewed in the specialized treatment centers (Paris, Lyon, Nice, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand). All the data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: 412 new cases of uveal melanomas were registered (incidence 0.7/100000) affecting 234 females and 178 males. The cases ranged in age from 7 to 93 years (mean 61.5 years). There were 5 (1%) isolated tumors of the iris, 75 (18%) of the ciliary body, either isolated (10%) either associated to iris and/or to choroidal tumors and 332 (81%) choroidal melanomas. 201 (53%) tumors were posterior to the equator and 153 (40%) had a margin at less than 3 mm of the optic disc; 87 (21%) melanomas were detected in asymptomatic patients. In 29 (7%) other cases, the diagnosis was established after enlargement of the tumor. In all other eyes, symptoms were present. 17% of the melanomas were T1, 34% were T2, et 48% were T3. 353 (86%) melanomas were pigmented, 30 (7%) were achromic and 29 (7%) of the mixed color type. 156 (38%) tumors were associated with a retinal detachment. In 12 cases (3%), at presentation there was an extrascleral extension. 9 patients (2%) had metastases (7 to the liver, 1 to the lungs and 1 to the lungs and bones). The study of the patients residence and work did not show any environmental risk factor. The initial treatment was protontherapy in 251 patients (63%), plaque therapy in 91 (23%), enucleation in 40 (10%), and other methods in 18. CONCLUSION: This was the first epidemiologic study conducted in France on this subject. It describes the clinical features of the disease, its geographical display and its management in this country.

Gamma-beam therapy was of one type. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival rates in patients treated by combined radiotherapy including intracavitary gamma-beam therapy based on the principle of successive administration of low or high activity radionuclides. However, the survival rate in them as compared to that in patients treated by intracavitary irradiation of common type, was much higher.

It can be a very useful complement of traditional microsurgery, pharmacotherapy or fractionated radiotherapy which are seldom a sufficient treatment on their own. The modern radiosurgery does not offer the experience representative enough in this indication. We can offer results of medium long follow-up for tumor growth and hormonal hypersecretion of pituitary adenomas in a relatively large series of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analyzed a group of 163 patients with pituitary adenoma treated with gamma knife during 5 years and followed 12-60 months, median 24 months after irradiation. An antiproliferative effect has been achieved in 1-2 years using the minimal dose to the margin 16-35 Gy, median 20 Gy in all our patients who were controlled by MRI (n = 126 patients). One half of these adenomas evidently decreased their size. Our effective antiproliferative dose was safe for the surrounding structures. The hormonal normalization has been achieved at 50.4% from 133 hypersecreting adenomas (39/91 = 43% of acromegalics, 11/13 = 85% of patients with Cushing's disease, 2/9 = 22% of patients with Nelson's syndrome, 11/18 = 61% of prolactinomas). The median latency was 12 months. The minimal dose to the margin was 10-45 Gy, median 35 Gy. Rare side effects were provoked only by increasing the dose to influence the hypersecretion-the development of partial hypopituitarism in 3.1% of patients, the panhypopituitarism in 0.6% of patient and there was 1 hemianopic visual field defect (0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery by gamma knife has a similar value for pituitary adenomas as microsurgery has with different distribution of advantages and drawbacks. This makes it suitable for the combined treatment where pharmacotherapy has its place under special conditions. Fractionated radiotherapy has now a marginal importance

The aim of this retrospective analysis was to analyze the predictive factors of long-term survival after surgery, focusing on depth of infiltration, type of surgical intervention and possible role of preoperative therapies, comparing survival of these patients with that of a group of patients affected by a Pancoast tumour and surgical treated in the same period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed records of 83 consecutive patients with NSCLC in stage T3 (owing to direct extension to chest wall), who underwent surgical resection in our Thoracic Surgery Unit between January 1994 and December 2003. Patients were classified in two groups: pancoast tumours (PT) or chest wall extending tumours (CW): survival and prognostic factors of each category were analyzed. RESULTS: In the CW group we had 68 patients: 45 were in stage IIB (pT3N0), 23 in stage IIIA (pT3-N1-2). Histology revealed adenocarcinoma in 23 cases, squamous cell carcinoma in 34, large cells anaplastic carcinoma in 8, adenosquamous carcinoma in 3. An involvement of chest wall tissues beyond the endothoracic fascia was found in 21 patients, while in the remaining 47 the invasion of chest wall tissues was confined to the parietal pleura. An extrapleural dissection was performed in 48 patients while combined pulmonary and chest wall en bloc resection was required in 20 patients. Resection was incomplete in three cases. In the PT group we had 15 patients: 11 were in stage IIB and 4 in stage IIIA. Histological type was adenocarcinoma in 10 cases, squamous cell carcinoma in 4 and adenosquamous carcinoma in 1. A univariate analysis performed in the CW group showed that survival was significantly affected by nodal status, stage, extension of chest wall invasion, type of lung resection and residual disease. In a multivariate analysis we found that nodal status, completeness of resection and extension of chest wall involvement maintained a significant prognostic value. There was no difference between the survival curve of CW and PT group: considering the two subset of CW patients, on the basis of depth of infiltration, survival of PT patients was significantly better than that of CW patients with involvement of muscular tissues and ribs (p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Nodal status, radical resection and depth of chest wall infiltration are the main predictive factors affecting long-term survival, while surgical procedure does not impact on it if margins of resection are free from disease. The better survival observed in PT patients let us to hypothesize that an induction chemo-radiation therapy, as routinely administered to PT patients, could have a potential benefit in survival of patients with CW tumour extending beyond parietal pleura

Three-dimensional conformation of the treatment volume to the target volume can thus be achieved. Following previously reported Phase I and Ib clinical trials, a Phase II trial was initiated with the goal of treating primary deep-seated tumors in a dose optimization schedule which included stepwise increase of total pion dose and of target volume. Patients with multicentric superficial bladder tumors who were cystectomy candidates were initially selected. Since then, more invasive cases have been treated. A graded scoring of acute tissue reactions was employed. Follow-up periods were from 10 to 20 months. The pion dose escalation ranged from 3000 rad (minimum) to 3600 rad (minimum) in 20 fractions over 5 weeks. The treatment volumes encompassed 190 cc for local to 1,820 cc for extended volume therapy. Treatment reactions ranged from a faint erythema and increase of bladder frequency to dry desquamation, mild nausea, moderate dysuria, and moderate proctitis or diarrhea with mucus. These reactions were closely related to treatment volume and site. One severe late cystitis has occurred in a patient treated with 2 courses of pions (4475 rad). Mild to moderate late proctitis has been seen in 4 patients. Ten of 13 bladder cancer patients had local control of disease while all 3 pancreas or biliary tract cancer patients had microscopic residual disease locally at time of death from metastasis. A total of 11 of 17 patients are thus clinically or pathologically free of local tumor to time of last observation

Whilst the commonly used imaging methods rely on simplified breathing patterns to acquire one breathing cycle, the proposed method was developed to study irregularities in organ motion during free breathing over tens of minutes. The method does not assume a constant breathing depth or even strict periodicity and does not depend on an external respiratory signal. Time-resolved 3D image sequences were reconstructed by retrospective stacking of dynamic 2D images using internal image-based sorting. The generic method is demonstrated for the liver and for the lung. Quantitative evaluations of the volume consistency show the advantages over one-dimensional measurements for image sorting. Dense deformation fields describing the respiratory motion were estimated from the reconstructed volumes using non-rigid 3D registration. All obtained motion fields showed variations in the range of minutes such as drifts and deformations, which changed both the exhalation position of the liver and the breathing pattern. The obtained motion data are used in proton therapy planning to evaluate dose delivery methodologies with respect to their motion sensitivity. Besides this application, the new possibilities of studying respiratory motion are valuable for other applications such as the evaluation of gating techniques with respect to residual motion

Irradiated tumors showed more likely necrosis (p = 0.01) had balloon cells (p = 0.01), and inflammatory infiltrate (p = 0.05). In the irradiated group, the prevalence of tumor blood vessel damage was higher (p = 0.0002) and mitotic figures were fewer (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that proton beam irradiation damages tumor cells and alters the tumor's capacity for cellular reproduction. It damages blood vessels leading to tumor necrosis. It induces an inflammatory response of unknown effects. Radiosensitivity of choroidal melanomas cannot be assessed using conventional histologic methods. However, tumor necrosis, mitotic activity and rate of balloon cells can help to establish tumoral sensitivity to irradiation

In this work, micronucleus dose-response curves for lymphocytes of normal and AT individuals, exposed in G(zero) to low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons, are compared. After gamma-irradiation, the micronucleus yields for AT lymphocytes are strongly increased compared with controls. The micronucleus dose-response curve for AT cells shows a linear dependence instead of a linear-quadratic one which is found for normal cells. After neutron irradiation, the increase in micronucleus yield above controls is less pronounced than with gamma-rays and the micronucleus dose-response curves are linear, as expected. The high increase in micronucleus yield compared with controls after gamma-irradiation further suggests the application of the micronucleus assay as a diagnostic tool for ataxia telangiectasia

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphocytes of five healthy volunteers were irradiated with low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons with doses ranging between 0.01 and 2 Gy. After post-irradiation incubation, B- and T-cells were isolated via CD3 and CD19 immunomagnetic microbeads. MN were analysed in both subpopulations. To study the underlying mechanism of chromosomal radiosensitivity, cell extracts prepared from purified B- and T-cells were subjected to SDS-electrophoresis and electroblotting using antibodies directed against the DNA-PK repair enzymes Ku70/86 and DNA-PKcs. Activity measurements were performed using the SignaTECT DNA-dependent protein kinase assay. DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and rejoining was determined using constant-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: For low LET gamma-rays a higher MN yield was observed in B-cells than in T-cells, but only in those samples exposed to doses < 1 Gy. For 1 Gy, the MN yields were comparable and for 2Gy even lower in B-cells compared with T-cells. After high LET neutron irradiation no significant differences in MN yields were observed between both subsets. The results of the DNA-PK experiments demonstrate that there is no difference between T- and B-cells in the basal expression and activity of DNA-PK repair proteins. No differences in DNA DSB induction and rejoining were found between T- and B-cells using constant-field gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: From the results, it was concluded that the enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity in B-cells is restricted to low doses (<1 Gy) of low LET radiation and that the chromosomal behaviour of B-cells to low LET radiation cannot be attributed to aberrant forms of the DNA-PK components. A type of chromosomal induced radioresistance (IRR) may be a possible explanation for the observed effect

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The G2 assay was performed on blood samples of four healthy donors who were irradiated with low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons. In a first set of experiments a dose-response curve for the formation of chromatid breaks was carried out for gamma-rays and neutrons with doses ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 Gy. In a second set of experiments, the kinetics of chromatid break formation and disappearance were investigated after a dose of 0.5 Gy using post-irradiation times ranging between 0.5 and 3.5 h. For the highest dose of 0.5 Gy, the number of isochromatid breaks was also scored. RESULTS: No significant differences in the number of chromatid breaks were observed between low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons for the four donors at any of the doses given. The dose-response curves for the formation of chromatid breaks are linear for both radiation qualities and RBEs = 1 were obtained. Scoring of isochromatid breaks at the highest dose of 0.5 Gy revealed that high-LET neutrons were, however, more effective at inducing isochromatid breaks (RBE = 6.2). The rejoining experiments further showed that the kinetics of disappearance of chromatid breaks following irradiation with low-LET gamma-rays or high-LET neutrons were not significantly different. Half-times of 0.92 h for gamma-rays and 0.84 h for neutrons were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the G2 assay, the results demonstrate that at low doses of irradiation, the induction as well as the disappearance of chromatid breaks is independent of the LET of the radiation qualities used (0.24 keV x microm(-1) 60Co gamma-rays and 20 keV x microm(-1) fast neutrons). As these radiation qualities produce the same initial number of double-strand breaks, the results support the signal model that proposes that chromatid breaks are the result of an exchange process which is triggered by a single double-strand break

METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery

The results, prognostic factors and live-tables will be demonstrated. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1984 and 1995 48 patients were treated at the Department of Radiooncology at the University of Munster because of epidural metastases. All but 3 cases were histologically proved. Three patients were irradiated without definitive histology because of clinical symptoms and CT or MR-imaging. Only patients with solid tumors were considered-patients with systemic diseases like leukemia or lymphoma were not analysed. In all of our cases irradiation was combined with systemic steroid application. Radiotherapy was performed with cobalt-60 or with an accelerator with total doses between 25 Gy and 40 Gy. RESULTS: The combination of irradiation and steroids had resulted in pain relief in about 80% of all patients. The ambulatory status after paraparesis was restituted in 35%. Best prognosis had been seen in patients with the following criterions: primary tumor should be breast cancer, no evidence of other tumor manifestation, no signs of paraparesis or paraplegia before the beginning of irradiation or regaining the ambulatory status after therapy. Under these conditions we have calculated a median survival rate of 709 days for these patients with good prognosis. Patients with bronchogenic carcinoma had a very poor prognosis with a median survival rate of only 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural metastases in cancer led often to a very fatal outcome. Irradiation is useful for pain relief and also for local tumor control. In some cases in patients with good prognostic factors long-time survival could be demonstrated. The results of irradiation are comparable with those after surgery

Most published clinical trials have confirmed hemoglobin to possess a significant influence on survival in patients treated with radiotherapy. In our study we have investigated the prognostic value of hemoglobin in a combined modality schedule. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with advanced head and neck tumors were treated with combined radio-chemotherapy. The therapy comprised 2 courses of induction chemotherapy with ifosfamide (1,500 mg/m2, day 1 to 5) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2, day 5) followed by hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a total dose of only 30 Gy. Surgery involved tumor resection and neck dissection. RESULTS: The 1-year overall survival rate and the 2-year survival rate were 79% and 56%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 68% and 49%, respectively. Prognostic factors with an impact on survival were seen in tumor size (T3 vs T4, p = 0.0088), response to radio-chemotherapy at the primary site (no vital tumor rest vs vital tumor rest, p = 0.045), response to lymph node radio-chemotherapy (no vital tumor cells vs vital tumor cells, p = 0.013) and level of hemoglobin after radio-chemotherapy (Hb > or = 11.5 g/dl vs < 11.5 g/dl, p = 0.0084). CONCLUSION: In our study hemoglobin level after radio-chemotherapy was identified for the first time to be also a significant prognostic factor (univariate analysis) in head and neck cancer patients who underwent combined radio-chemotherapy. Besides chemotherapy plus low-dose irradiation achieved similar results in comparison with radical resection and high-dose radiotherapy at least for the first 2 years after therapy. Relapsing disease could be treated with 1 additional course of radiotherapy which is supposed to be well tolerated

In functionally inoperable patients radiation therapy offers the second best changes. However, in cases of severe emphysema with severely limited lung function even conventional radiation therapy is prohibited because of possible fibrotic reactions of the lung parenchyma. For such patients high dose rate stereotactic one-time radiation therapy may be an option. According to the study protocol of the DKFZ Heidelberg a dose rate of 24 Gy at the iso-center is applied with the linear accelerator in a single session. The recognisable tumour is irradiated with 22 Gy (90% isodose included). 20 Gy are applied to the tumour plus 6 millimeters safety margin. Prerequisites of such a therapy are a detailed computer-based planning using CT scans and an exact positioning with immobilisation of the patient. The irradiation is ideally performed under general anesthesia with high-frequency jetventilation to avoid movements due to breathing. We report on this new therapeutic modality in a patient with lung emphysema having a T2 tumour

Individual proton spectra from the 3-D array of spectra encompassing the lesion showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation necrosis, recurrent or residual tumor, or normal brain. The 1H-MRS imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or recurrent tumor and contrast-enhancing radiation-induced necrosis. Regions of abnormally high choline (Cho) levels, consistent with viable tumor, were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 gliomas. Changes in the serial 1H-MRS imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following treatment. These changes included the significant reduction in Cho levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to necrotic tissue. For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical progression, an increase in Cho levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or necrotic. Several patients showed regional variations in response to brachytherapy as evaluated by 1H-MRS imaging. This study demonstrates the potential of noninvasive 3-D 1H-MRS imaging to discriminate between the formation of contrast-enhancing radiation necrosis and residual or recurrent tumor following brachytherapy. This modality may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to brachytherapy by detecting the presence of abnormnal metabolite levels in nonenhancing regions of solid tumor

We sought to determine the value of proton MR spectroscopy in assessing brain tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child's treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: In children with brain tumors, MR spectroscopy of brain tissue remote from the tumor reveals treatment-related biochemical changes

Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring

Satisfactory dose uniformity was demonstrated by the computation of dose distributions on the full summed electron pencil beam model on the Target Series 2 treatment planning system. Verification of the calculated dose homogeneity was confirmed with lithium fluoride (TLD-100) thermoluminescent dosimetry.

For head and neck tumors, the excellent results reported from Hammersmith were not confirmed by an EORTC combined trial (Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Essen). For salivary glands, high percentages (75%) of local control were obtained in Hammersmith and in Amsterdam, as well as in other centers. Following the promising results reported from Hammersmith, neutron therapy of soft tissue sarcomas was started in several centers. For patients with no clinical evidence of residual tumor after surgery, a local control rate ranging between 70% and 90% was achieved (Essen, Hamburg, Heidelberg, Louvain-la-Neuve). For patients with "gross" residual tumor, or with inoperable tumors, the percentages of local control vary within large limits (20-75%) from center to center, probably according to differences in histology, tumor localization, tumor size or extention, and perhaps fractionation (Hammersmith, Edinburg, Amsterdam, Essen, Hamburg, Heidelberg, Louvain-la-Neuve). A study on bronchus carcinoma, performed in Heidelberg, did not show any benefit with neutron therapy. Patients with locally extended cervix and prostate carcinoma were treated in Louvain-la-Neuve according to the RTOG protocol; an excellent early tolerance was noticed. However, for both sites, it is too early to derive valid long term conclusions. For prostatic tumors, a complete regression is usually achieved. For bladder carcinoma, the results from Manchester did not indicate a significant difference between neutron and photon therapy, both in initial assessment of results and complications. The Amsterdam group came to similar conclusions

The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described. [References: 15]

The radiobiological arguments for high-LET radiation in cancer therapy are reviewed: reduction of OER in the case of hypoxic and poorly-reoxygenating tumours, and the lesser importance of repair phenomena which are a problem in controlling repair-proficient photon-resistant tumours. Fast neutrons were the first type of high-LET radiation used clinically, and were often applied under suboptimal technical conditions. Nevertheless, useful clinical information was derived from the neutron experience. A greater benefit from neutrons than from conventional radiotherapy was found for several tumour sites. The present discussion is limited to the results for salivary gland tumours and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Based on the fast neutron experience, radiobiological arguments, and the added benefit of excellent physical selectivity of ion beams, the potential clinical indications for high-LET ions are discussed: hypoxic, slowly growing and well-differentiated photon-resistant tumours. One of the main remaining issues is the selection of individual patients for high- or low-LET radiation. Since the physical selectivity of ions now matches that obtained with other techniques, the selection of patients will be based only on the radiobiological characteristics of the tumour

METHODS: Seventy-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients that using radiotherapy were divided into two groups: HYYR group (A) and the control group (B) using Wisk lotion for gargling or apply at the skin lesion. RESULTS: The injury on mucous membrane of mouth cavity and skin were 47.2%, 91.7%, 13.9%, 33.3% in group A and B respectively, the degree of injury was different (P < 0.01). The acute reaction of the mucous membrane of mouth cavity did not occur until the cumulative radiation were 41.4 +/- 9.4, 30.9 +/- 8.9 in group A and B respectively, there was significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01).

With few exceptions, previous studies have combined results for clival and sacral chordomas, or for chordomas and other similar tumours such as chondrosarcoma, and thus it is difficult to be specific about effects of therapy. This study included histological review using immunohistochemistry to confirm diagnosis. Analysis of the survival data for our patients suggests that there are two subgroups with distinct survival patterns: one group with high mortality within the first 5 years, and a second group with an indolent disease process and near normal life expectancy. The age of the patients at presentation ranged from 7 to 78 years, with a mean of 44.3 years. Male: female distribution was 6:5. The commonest presentation was with cranial nerve palsy (94%) or with headache (60%). The most frequently involved cranial nerve was the VIth (60%), followed by the IXth and Xth (40% each). Comparing our results with those of 50 years ago, there was little improvement in the outlook for these patients, despite improvements in surgical approaches and the use of radiotherapy. The promising results in skull base tumours using proton therapy must be treated with caution until definite criteria for diagnosis and outcome have been established. There is a case for a multicentre prospective study of this disease	
0	4419	Clinical dosimetry for radiotherapy to the breast based on imaging with the prototype Royal Marsden Hospital CT simulator.[erratum appears in Phys Med Biol 1987 Nov;32(11):1516-7]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	The result of conservative management of breast cancer is strongly dependent on the homogeneity of the dose delivered a schedule of post-surgical radiotherapy. In addition to improvements in local control, late normal-tissue effects should be minimised by achieving a good dose homogeneity. The Royal Marsden Hospital prototype CT simulator has been used to image patients in the treatment position. With the CT data incorporated into the planning process a quantitative measure of the dose homogeneity was made. There are strong indications that unless tissue compensators are used and/or conformation therapy is performed, the dose inhomogeneity in a widely used treatment geometry is too large to be clinically acceptable

METHODS: Between November 1992 and August 2000, 88 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory with proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery in which two to four convergent fixed beams of 160-MeV protons were applied. The median transverse diameter was 16 mm (range, 2.5-35 mm), and the median tumor volume was 1.4 cm(3) (range, 0.1-15.9 cm(3)). Surgical resection had been performed previously in 15 patients (17%). Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann Grade 1) and trigeminal nerve function were normal in 79 patients (89.8%). Eight patients (9%) had good or excellent hearing (Gardner-Robertson [GR] Grade 1), and 13 patients (15%) had serviceable hearing (GR Grade 2). A median dose of 12 cobalt Gray equivalents (range, 10-18 cobalt Gray equivalents) was prescribed to the 70 to 108% isodose lines (median, 70%). The median follow-up period was 38.7 months (range, 12-102.6 mo). RESULTS: The actuarial 2- and 5-year tumor control rates were 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.9-99.9%) and 93.6% (95% CI, 88.3-99.3%). Salvage radiosurgery was performed in one patient 32.5 months after treatment, and a craniotomy was required 19.1 months after treatment in another patient with hemorrhage in the vicinity of a stable tumor. Three patients (3.4%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus, and a subsequent partial resection was performed in one of these patients. The actuarial 5-year cumulative radiological reduction rate was 94.7% (95% CI, 81.2-98.3%). Of the 21 patients (24%) with functional hearing (GR Grade 1 or 2), 7 (33.3%) retained serviceable hearing ability (GR Grade 2). Actuarial 5-year normal facial and trigeminal nerve function preservation rates were 91.1% (95% CI, 85-97.6%) and 89.4% (95% CI, 82-96.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that prescribed dose (P = 0.005), maximum dose (P = 0.006), and the inhomogeneity coefficient (P = 0.03) were associated with a significant risk of long-term facial neuropathy. No other cranial nerve deficits or cancer relapses were observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery has been shown to be an effective means of tumor control. A high radiological response rate was observed. Excellent facial and trigeminal nerve function preservation rates were achieved. A reduced prescribed dose is associated with a significant decrease in facial neuropathy

Case report and review of the literature.[see comment].

The optimal therapeutic management is unclear but, in general, this tumour is treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Proton beam radiation therapy (PT) offers superior dose distributional qualities compared with X- or gamma rays, as the dose deposition occurs in a modulated narrow zone called the Bragg peak. As a result, organs at risk are optimally speared. Here, we present a patient treated with the first spinal axis segment irradiation using spot-scanning PT with a single field, combined with conventional cranio-spinal axis radiotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy, and an extensive review of the literature outlining the clinical features and treatment modality of spinal PNET.

1	1042	Spot-scanning proton radiation therapy for recurrent, residual or untreated intracranial meningiomas.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Child, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm,Residual, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Safety, Survival, Survival Analysis, Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PRT) in the treatment of intracranial meningiomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related	
1	1105	A treatment planning comparison of intensity modulated photon and proton therapy for paraspinal sarcomas	Cobalt, Heart, Humans, Lead, Liver, Lung, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach, Switzerland	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between intensity modulated (IM) photon therapy and IM proton therapy (IMPT) in paraspinal sarcomas, so as to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. In the case of IM proton therapy, plans were compared also for two different sizes of the pencil beam. Finally, a 10% and 20% dose escalation with IM protons was planned, and the consequential organ at risk (OAR) irradiation was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 5 patients were computed for IM photons (7 coplanar fields) and protons (3 coplanar beams), using the KonRad inverse treatment planning system (developed at the German Cancer Research Center). IMPT planning was performed assuming 2 different sizes of the pencil beam: IMPT with a beam of full width at half-maximum of 20 mm, and IMPT with a "mini-beam" (IMPT(M), full width at half-maximum = 12 mm). Prescribed dose was 77.4 Gy or cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for protons to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Surface and center spinal cord dose constraint for all techniques was 64 and 53 Gy/CGE, respectively. Tumor and OAR dose-volume histograms were calculated. Results were analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient, and conformity index. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume coverage was optimal and equally homogeneous with both IM photon and IM proton plans. Compared to the IM photon plans, the use of IM proton beam therapy leads to a substantial reduction of the OAR total integral dose in the low-level to mid-dose level. Median heart, lung, kidney, stomach, and liver mean dose and dose at the 50% volume level were consistently reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 25. Tumor dose homogeneity in IMPT(M) plans was always better than with IMPT planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient, 0.19 vs. 0.25). IMPT dose escalation (to 92.9 CGE to the GTV) was possible in all patients without exceeding the normal-tissue dose limits. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of IM photon therapy, when compared to IM protons, can result in similar levels of tumor conformation. IM proton therapy, however, reduces the OAR integral dose substantially, compared to IM photon radiation therapy. As a result, tumor dose escalation was always possible with IM proton planning, within the maximal OAR dose constraints. In IM proton planning, reducing the size of the proton pencil beam (using the "mini-beam") improved the dose homogeneity, but it did not have a significant effect on the dose conformity	
1	674	Results of spot-scanning proton radiation therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base: the Paul Scherrer Institut experience	Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Carbon, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To assess the clinical results of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PT) in the treatment of skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas (CS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up	
1	675	Proton beam radiotherapy versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: A comparative study	Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Germany, Humans, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study was undertaken between proton and photon therapy in uveal melanoma to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. A fixed proton horizontal beam (OPTIS) and intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT), with multiple noncoplanar beam arrangements, was compared with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), using a static and a dynamic micromultileaf collimator and intensity-modulated RT (IMRS). METHOD AND MATERIALS: A planning CT scan was performed on a brain metastasis patient, with a 3-mm acquisition slice spacing and the patient looking at a luminous spot with the eyes in three different positions (neutral and 25 degrees right and left). Four different gross tumor volumes were defined for each treatment technique. These target scenarios represented different locations (involving vs. not involving the macula and temporal vs. nasal) and volumes (10 x 6 mm vs. 16 x 10 mm) to challenge the proton and photon treatment techniques. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 2 mm laterally and 3 mm craniocaudally for both modalities. A dose homogeneity of 95-99% of the planning target volume was used as the "goal" for all techniques. The dose constraint (maximum) for the organs at risk (OARs) for both the proton and the SRT photon plans was 27.5, 22.5, 20, and 9 CGE-Gy for the optic apparatus, retina, lacrimal gland, and lens, respectively. The dose to the planning target volume was 50 CGE-Gy in 10 CGE-Gy daily fractions. The plans for proton and photon therapy were computed using the Paul Scherrer Institute and BrainSCAN, version 5.2 (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) treatment planning systems, respectively. Tumor and OARs dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using the dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index (CI(95%)), and inhomogeneity coefficient. RESULTS: Target coverage of all simulated uveal melanomas was equally conformal with the photon and proton modalities. The median CI(95%) value was 1.74, 1.86, and 1.83 for the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively. With proton planning, the median CI(95%) was 1.88 for OPTIS and substantially improved with IMPT in some tumor cases (median CI(95%), 1.29). The tumor dose homogeneity in the proton plans was, however, always better than with SRT photon planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient 0.1 and 0.15 vs. 0.46, 0.41, and 0.23 for the OPTIS and IMPT vs. the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively). Compared with the photon plans, the use of protons did not lead to a substantial reduction in the homolateral OAR total integral dose in the low- to high-dose level, except for the lacrimal gland. The median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume with the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans was 33-30.8, 31.8-28, and 35.8-49 Gy, respectively, for the lacrimal gland, a critical organ. For protons, only the OPTIS plans were better, with a median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume using OPTIS and IMPT of 19.2 and 8.8 and 25.6 and 23.6 CGE, respectively. The contralateral OARs were completely spared with the proton plans, but the median dose delivered to these structures was 1.2 Gy (range, 0-6.3 Gy) with the SRT photon plans. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of SRT photon techniques, compared with protons, can result in similar levels of dose conformation. IMPT did not increase the degree of conformality for this small tumor. Tumor dose inhomogeneity was, however, always increased with photon planning. Except for the lacrimal gland, the use of protons, with or without intensity modulation, did not increase homolateral OAR dose sparing. The dose to all the contralateral OARs was, however, completely eliminated with proton planning

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 2001, AFR was used to treat 36 patients with advanced stage primary (n=33) or recurrent (n=3) nasal or paranasal malignant tumors. Full ophthalmologic follow-up was documented. The median dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 69.6 CGE (range 60.8-77). Visual complications were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and the late effects of normal tissue (LENT) scoring systems. The median follow-up was 52.4 months (range 17-122.8). RESULTS: Thirteen patients developed late visual/ocular toxicity. Cataracts were LENT grade 1 and 3 in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One LENT grade 1 vascular retinopathy and 1 optic neuropathy were also observed. Three and five patients presented with nasolacrimal duct stenosis (CTC grade 2, 2 patients; CTC grade 3, 1 patient) and dry-eye syndrome (CTC grade 1, 1 patient; CTC grade 2, 4 patients), respectively. The 3- and 5-year probability of LENT/CTC grade > or =2 visual toxicity were 15.8+/-6.7% and 20.7+/-7.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AFR for locally advanced nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors enables delivery of 70 CGE to the tumor with acceptable ophthalmologic complications

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable

Protons administer a uniform dose across the target and then virtually zero deep to the target and lower dose proximal to the target (for non-superficial lesions). The result is a smaller treatment volume, and therefore a lower incidence and frequency of treatment-related morbidity. Moreover, the reduction in treatment volume permits a higher dose to the tumor. This means an improved local control probability and lower normal tissue complication probability. Evidence-based medicine has demonstrated that clinical gains have been realized in the treatment of patient with uveal melanoma, skull-base or spinal sarcoma and prostate cancer. In the future, more extensive prospective studies are required to assess more completely the potential clinical benefit of proton beam therapy in many anatomical sites in children and adults.

In follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases conventional contrast-enhanced morphological MR imaging is often unable to distinguish between transient radiation effects, radionecrosis,and tumor recurrence. To evaluate changes of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in irradiated brain metastases arterial spin-labeling techniques (ASL) were applied and compared to the outcome of (1)H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRS, SI). PATIENTS AND METHODS. In 2 patients follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases were performed on a 1.5-T tomograph (average single dose: 20 Gy/80% isodose). Relative CBF values of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM),and metastases (Met) were measured by means of the ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS. (1)H MRS was performed with PRESS 1500/135. RESULTS. In both patients with initially hyperperfused metastases (Met/GM >1) the reduction of rCBF after stereotactic radiosurgery indicated response to treatment--even if the contrast-enhancing region increased--while increasing rCBF values indicated tumor progression. The findings were confirmed by (1)H MRS, SI and subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSION. The ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS are able to monitor changes of rCBF in irradiated brain metastases. The two cases imply a possible role for ASL-MR perfusion imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy in differentiating radiation effects from tumor progression

A limited institutional pilot study was therefore done by the Southwest Oncology Group between October 1977, and November 1978 to test the benefit of this program in previously untreated persons with Stages 3 and 4 diffuse histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eleven evaluable patients with the following histologies were treated: 7 poorly differentiated, 2 with histiocytic, 1 with mixed lymphoma and 1 with well-differentiated morphology. CHOP was given in the following manner: cyclophosphamide 400 mg/M2 IV day 1, adriamycin 40 mg/M2 IV day 1, vincristine 2 mg IV day 1, and Prednisone 100 mg po daily X 5. Forty-five rad total body irradiation was delivered in three fractions on days 21, 23 and 25. Chemotherapy was repeated on day 42, etc., until four cycles of CHOP and three cycles TBI (135R) were delivered. Responses were seen in 8/11 patients (6 CR and 2 PR); 5 persons are currently alive and 6 are dead. Two of the living patients are alive with disease and the remainder are in unmaintained remission. Two persons died with no response and one died in complete remission of an unrelated illness. The median duration of remission is 15 months and the median survival for all patients is 48 months. The therapy was well tolerated with a mean nadir leukocyte count of 3,020 X 10(9)/microliters (range 1.2-5.5) and a mean nadir platelet count of 188 X 10(9)/microliters (range 016-270). As delivered, this program is capable of producing durable remissions and needs to be verified in a larger series of patients

Studies have shown that the scatter radiation to the contralateral breast may play a large part in the induction of secondary breast cancers. Factors that may contribute to the contralateral breast dose may include the use of blocks, the orientation of the field, and wedges. Reports have shown that the use of regular wedges, particularly for the medial tangential field, gives a significantly higher dose to the contralateral breast compared to an open field. This paper compares the peripheral dose outside the field using a regular wedge, a dynamic wedge, and an open field technique. The data collected consisted of measurements taken with patients, solid water and a Rando phantom using a Varian 2300CD linear accelerator. Ion chambers, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), diodes, and films were the primary means for collecting the data. The measurements show that the peripheral dose outside the field using a dynamic wedge is close to that of open fields, and significantly lower than that of regular wedges. This information indicates that when using a medial wedge, a dynamic wedge should be used

Common to all of these methods is the time-dependent change of certain accelerator parameters during radiation treatment. The accelerators for which these methods can be used are equipped with independent collimator jaws, however, not with any kind of multileaf collimation. This method was designed to deposit a certain group of dose distributions that are restricted by a small number of constraints. The developed methods were implemented into a digitally controlled medical linear accelerator and the dosimetric results of such treatments were evaluated. Dose distributions with spatial dependencies in one and in two dimensions were deposited by movement of one X-ray jaw pair. Furthermore, a method for generation of a two-dimensional rotationally symmetric dose distribution was developed

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article reviews the limited experiences on splenic irradiation in autoimmune thrombocytopenia by analyzing the current studies including 71 patients and some preliminary reports on splenic irradiation in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. RESULTS: In autoimmune thrombocytopenia between 40 and 90% of all patients responded, but most of them relapsed within 4 to 6 months after splenic irradiation. Between 10 and 20% of all patients had a sustained response. The efficacy of splenic irradiation in HIV-associated cases of thrombocytopenia is probably lower than in other forms of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, but especially in this group immunosuppressive drug treatment of autoimmune thrombocytopenia exposes some problems. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia there are some case reports about efficacy of splenic irradiation. Toxicity of splenic irradiation in both diseases was very moderate. CONCLUSIONS: For HIV patients, for elderly patients or patients at high risk for complications following splenectomy splenic irradiation might be a treatment option. Splenic irradiation as preoperative treatment in patients not responding to or not suitable for immunosuppressive drugs prior to splenectomy may be a promising new application of splenic irradiation to reduce adverse effects of splenectomy in thrombocytopenic patients. A further analysis of the biological mechanisms underlying splenic irradiation may help to improve patient selection, to optimize dose concepts and treatment schedules and will improve understanding of radiotherapy as an immunomodulatory treatment modality.

Most of the tumours grew superficially and half deeply. Results were analysed with regard to tumour regression, local recurrence and frequency of metastases after treatment. Surprisingly good tumour regression, a low local recurrence rate (11%) and no enhancement of distant metastases were found. Treatment rhythms hat not to be altered. Tissue reactions were extremely low. The combined hyperthermia-radiation treatment has its advantages especially, when ionising radiation of low LET is used

We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors. However, simultaneous individual anesthetic challenges require pediatric anesthesiologists highly experienced with the pediatric airway, clinical alertness and closed monitoring

The tomotherapy unit can generate CT images from the megavoltage radiation it uses for treatment as often as needed during a course of radiation therapy. These megavoltage CT (MVCT) images offer verification of patient position prior to and potentially during radiation therapy, and provide considerably more anatomical detail than the conventional radiation therapy port films used for patient set-up verification. Also, MVCT imaging may enable reconstruction of the radiation dose delivered, thereby providing unprecedented verification of the actual treatment. These key features of helical tomotherapy distinguish it from other IMRT approaches. We report results from a pilot feasibility trial of 10 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on whom we obtained MVCT images using a prototype helical tomotherapy system. All patients underwent conventional CT imaging for radiation therapy treatment planning. Specific aims were to subjectively compare MVCT and conventional CT images and then to objectively compare the 2 modalities by contouring tumors and performing a volumetric comparison. Seven patients had disease located primarily in the lung parenchyma, 2 primarily in the mediastinum, and 1 in both. When evaluated by location, all 7 patients with lesions primarily in the lung parenchyma had subjectively high-quality MVCT images. Objectively, the volumetric agreement between conventional and MVCT for parenchymal lesions was excellent in 5 of the 7 patients. Megavoltage CT imaging via the helical tomotherapy prototype provided adequate information for use in verification of patient position and dose reconstruction for lesions within the pulmonary parenchyma, but presently appears suboptimal for primarily mediastinal disease. Further studies are ongoing to optimize MVCT imaging and better define its utility in patients with NSCLC

The cause of this leakage was analyzed and the amount of leakage was measured for different electron beam energies. The highest leakage occurred with a 6 x 6 cm cone using a 12 MeV electron beam. The leakage dose measured along the side of the cone could be as great as 40%. Until the cones are modified or redesigned, it is advised that all patient setups be carefully reviewed to assure that no significant patient areas are in the side scatter region

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1981 and November 1996, 46 patients with partially resected, biopsied, or recurrent meningiomas (median age of 50 years; range 11-74 years) were treated with combined photon and 160-MeV proton beam therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, using computed tomography-based conformal 3D treatment planning. Nine patients were treated after incomplete tumor resection, 8 patients after tumor biopsy only, and 29 patients after tumor recurrence following gross total (10/29 patients) or progression after subtotal (19/29 patients) resection. All patients were classified as benign meningioma on review slides at MGH. The median dose to the macroscopic gross tumor volume was 59.0 CGE (range 53.1-74.1 CGE, CGE = proton Gy x 1.1 RBE). The median follow-up was 53 months (range 12-207). RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 93 and 77%, respectively, and the recurrence-free rate at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 88%, respectively. Survival without severe toxicity was 80% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients presented with local tumor recurrence at 61, 95, and 125 months. One patient developed distant intradural metastasis at 21 and 88 months. No patient died from recurrent meningioma; however, 4 patients died of other causes. A fifth patient died from a brainstem necrosis after 22 months. Eight patients developed severe long-term toxicity from radiotherapy, including ophthalmologic (4 patients), neurologic (4 patients), and otologic (2 patients) complications. All patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic nerve structures in the current protocol. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with recurrent or incompletely resected benign intracranial menigiomas. Observed toxicity appears to be dose-related; with currently employed dose constraints, toxicity should not exceed that seen in patients treated with conformal fractionated supervoltage photon radiotherapy

Iodine contrast agents (CA), used during computed tomography (CT) imaging, lead to an increase of the Hounsfield units in tissue with increased CA uptake and cause errors in the calculation of the ranges. The aim of this work is to quantify how accurately ion range is calculated in CA loaded tissue. In order to quantify the mean change in Hounsfield units (HU), a statistical analysis of 25 CT data sets with and without CA was performed. To establish a relation between the change in Hounsfield units due to CA and changes in ion range, the Hounsfield number for various CA concentrations and the range of ions in CA was measured. The analysis of CT data sets showed that after intravenous injection of 100 ml contrast agent (Imeron300) at a concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml an increase of the Hounsfield numbers in tumor tissue of up to 57 HU can be observed. The measured range shift in CA is much smaller than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The maximum error in range resulting from the CA enhanced data is approximately 2.5% and results mainly from this wrong interpretation of HU by the TPS. For a tumor with an extent of 5 cm this leads to an exaggeration of the ion ranges during irradiation of (1.24+/-0.04) mm. This may be clinically relevant in cases where highest precision is needed and where organs at risk are close to the target volume. In view of these findings it may be safer to rely solely on native CT data for the purpose of dose and range optimization in therapy planning for heavy ions and protons

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

Besides the physical selectivity that makes ions especially efficient for deep-seated tumours and tumours close to critical organs, carbon ions with their enhanced relative biological effectiveness offer an additional biological advantage for slow-growing radioresistant tumours, with an additional gain for tumours with hypoxic sections. These advantages can only be fully exploited by active beam-shaping and biology-based treatment planning

All tumors were followed for a minimum of ten months after treatment. Seven lesions completely disappeared, 33 have decreased in size, and 4 remained unchanged. Associated signs of tumor regression were: resolution of the secondary serous retinal detachments, central apical yellow discoloration of the tumor, destruction of the tumor's vasculature, and elimination of fluorescein leakage. This study demonstrated that regression after proton beam irradiation is a relatively slow process, and the effects of radiation could be observed in some cases more than a year after treatment

Detailed results have been published previously [17]. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1972 and 1993, 57 patients were treated curatively with radiation alone (n = 13) or combined surgery and pre- and/or postoperative irradiation (n = 44). Gross complete resection was achieved in 82% of patients and margins were negative in 5 patients. Doses ranged from 36.0 to 79.2 Gy (median 64.8 Gy), usually conventionally fractionated. In 16 patients protons were used. Median follow-up time was 4.3 years (range 1.1 to 16.8 years). RESULTS: After 5 years, patients with angiosarcomas (n = 11) and patients with other tumor types (n = 46) had locoregional control rates of 24% and 69%, distant failure rates of 58% and 17%, and overall survival rates of (for overall survival) and T stage (for locoregional control) (p < 0.05). Particularly, gross completely resected T1 tumors had a locoregional control rate of 91%. Patients with locoregional recurrence were at an increased risk to die (p = 0.004 in multivariate analysis). Patients with and without direct tumor extension to neurovascular structures, bones, organs, or skin had distant failure rates of 27% and 0%, respectively (p = 0.031). In multivariate analysis, direct extension was additionally a negative prognosticator of overall survival (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: 1. Angiosarcomas of the head and neck have a considerably poorer prognosis than other soft tissue sarcomas of this region. 2. Head and neck sarcomas have a higher local recurrence rate than for example soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. Optimisation of local treatment through combination of surgery and high-dose irradiation, however, can achieve improved results, especially for prognostically favourable subgroups. 3. In addition to tumor grade and size, direct tumor extension may be a useful additional staging parameter

The 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival rates for these 133 patients were 82% and 61%, respectively. Stage for stage, the development of local regional failure was reduced for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy compared with a historic control series. Local recurrence occurred in 8%, 21%, and 31% of patients with Stage B3, C2, and C3 tumors who had radiation therapy, respectively, whereas the local failure rates were 31%, 36%, and 53% in patients treated with surgery alone. There was a 13% and 12% improvement in the 5-year disease-free survival rate in the patients with Stage B3 and C3 lesions who had radiotherapy compared with the historic controls. For patients with Stage C disease, local control and disease-free survival rates decreased progressively with increasing nodal involvement; however, local control and disease-free survival rates were higher in the patients who had radiotherapy than in those who had surgery alone. Failure patterns in the patients who had radiotherapy did not show any notable changes compared with those for patients who had surgery alone. Postoperative radiation therapy for Stage B3, C2, and C3 colonic carcinoma is a promising treatment approach that deserves further investigation

DESIGN: A retrospective, nonrandomized comparative study. METHODS: Charts of patients treated with 125I, 106Ru, and PBRT for choroidal melanoma between January 1988 and June 1996 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospitals were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Local control of choroidal melanomas after 125I, 106Ru, or PBRT. RESULTS: A total of 597 patients were identified (125I = 190, 106Ru = 140, PBRT = 267). Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did patients treated with either 125I (P = 0.0133; confidence interval [CI], 1.26-7.02; risk ratio, 2.97) or PBRT (P = 0.0097; CI, 1.30-6.66; risk ratio, 2.94). A stepwise Cox proportional hazard model found maximal basal diameter to be a significant covariate (P = 0.0033). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did those patients treated with either 125I or PBRT

METHODS: In this noncomparative interventional case series, 40 patients with small melanocytic tumors of the choroid (thickness <3.5 mm) underwent TTT. Follow-up examinations including ophthalmoscopy, ultrasonography, and fundus photography were conducted at 24 to 48 hours, 2 to 6 weeks, and 6-month intervals after treatment. RESULTS: Forty patients (mean age, 58 years) with small melanocytic tumors underwent TTT. Mean follow-up in all patients was 42 months. In most cases TTT resulted in tumor regression. Thirty-one (77.5%) of 40 tumors did not recur after initial treatment with TTT. In 5 (12.5%) of 40 tumors with initial basal diameters ranging from 4 x 2.75 mm to 7.5 x 6 mm and a mean initial thickness of 2.0 mm, edge recurrences developed, which were satisfactorily treated with additional TTT (4 cases) or cryotherapy (1 case). The mean interval between initial TTT and recurrence in this subgroup was 15 months (range, 7-22 months). Of 36 eyes that were successfully treated with TTT or cryotherapy, 26 eyes (72%) had posttreatment visual acuity better than or equal to pretreatment visual acuity. Four (10%) of 40 tumors were not controlled with TTT and eventually required brachytherapy (n = 1), proton radiation (n = 1), or enucleation (n = 2). The initial basal diameters of these tumors ranged from 7.5 x 7.5 mm to 9 x 7.5 mm, with a mean initial thickness of 2.6 mm. The mean interval between treatment and determination of treatment failure was 22 months (range, 7-30 months). CONCLUSIONS: Transpupillary thermotherapy resulted in tumor regression of most small melanocytic choroidal tumors. Tumor edge recurrences were successfully treated with additional TTT in most cases. Four tumors required irradiation or enucleation because of treatment failures with TTT. Transpupillary thermotherapy as a stand-alone therapy is insufficient for some small choroidal melanomas

BNCT involves the irradiation of cancer patients by a beam of neutrons, with an energy range of predominantly 1 eV to 10 keV. The patient is infused with a tumor-seeking, (10)B-loaded compound prior to irradiation. Neutron capture in the (10)B atoms results in a high local radiation dose to the tumor cells, whilst sparing the healthy tissue. Neutron capture, however, also occurs in other atoms naturally present in tissue, sometimes resulting in radionuclides that will be present after treatment. The patient is therefore, following BNCT, radioactive. The importance of this induced activity with respect to the absorbed dose in the patient as well as to the radiation exposure of the staff has been investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As a standard radiation protection procedure, the ambient dose equivalent rate was measured on all patients following BNCT using a dose ratemeter. Furthermore, some of the patients underwent measurements using a gamma-ray spectrometer to identify which elements and confirm which isotopes are activated. RESULTS: Peak levels, i.e., at contact and directly after irradiation, are of the order of 40-60 muSv/h, falling to < 10 muSv/h 30-50 min after treatment. The average ambient dose equivalent in the first 2 h at a distance of 2 m from the patient is in the order of 2.5 muSv. The ambient dose equivalent rate in 2 m distance from the patient's head at the earliest time of leaving the reactor center (20 min after the end of treatment) is far less than 1 muSv/h. The main radioisotopes were identified as (38)Cl, (49)Ca, and (24)Na. Furthermore, in two patients, the isotopes (198)Au and (116m)In were also present. The initial activity is predominantly due to (49)Ca, whilst the remaining activity is predominantly due to (24)Na. CONCLUSION: The absorbed dose resulting from the activated isotopes in the irradiated volume is in the order of < 1% of the prescribed dose and therefore does not add a significant contribution to the absorbed dose in the target volume. In other parts of the patient's body, the absorbed dose by induced activity is magnitudes smaller and can be neglected. The levels of radiation received by staff members and non-radiation workers (i.e., accompanying persons) are well below the recommended limits

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred twenty patients with carcinoma of the cervix were treated by primary radiotherapy between 1991 and 1998. The median age was 63 (range 24-84). The distribution according to Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was as follows: Stage IB, 11.4%; IIA, 9.1%; IIB, 50.9%; IIIA, 3.6%; IIIB, 23.2%; and IVA, 1.8%. They were treated with whole pelvic irradiation giving 40 Gy to the midplane in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. This was followed by parametrial irradiation, giving 16-20 Gy in 8-10 fractions. HDR intracavitary brachytherapy was given weekly, with a dose of 7 Gy to point A for three fractions and, starting from 1996, 6 Gy weekly for four fractions. The median overall treatment time was 50 days (range 42-73 days). The median follow-up time was 4.7 years (range 3 months to 11.1 years). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The complete remission rate after radiotherapy was 93.4% (211/226). The 5-year actuarial failure-free survival (FFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates for stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA were 87.7% and 86.6%, 85% and 85%, 67.8% and 74%, 46.9% and 54.7%, 44.8% and 50.4%, 0% and 25%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, young age (< 50) (p = 0.0054), adenocarcinoma (p = 0.0384), and stage (p = 0.0005) were found to be independent poor prognostic factors. The 5-year actuarial major complication rates (Grade 3 or above) were as follows: proctitis, 1.0%; cystitis, 0.5%; enteritis, 1.3%; and overall, 2.8%. On multivariate analysis, history of pelvic surgery was a significant prognosticator. The two HDR fractionation schedules were not a significant prognosticator in predicting disease control and complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience in treating cervical cancer with HDR intracavitary brachytherapy is encouraging. Our treatment results and complication rates were compatible with those of the LDR series. Further studies are eagerly awaited to better define the optimal fractionation schedule for HDR brachytherapy and the schedule on how chemotherapy may be combined with it. [References: 41]	
0	825	Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer by CT-linear accelerator combination: prostate movements and dosimetric considerations	Humans, Immobilization/mt [Methods], Male, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostate/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/ra [Radiography], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uncertainty	PURPOSE: Multiple studies have indicated that the prostate is not stationary and can move as much as 2 cm. Such prostate movements are problematic for intensity-modulated radiotherapy, with its associated tight margins and dose escalation. Because of these intrinsic daily uncertainties, a relative generous "margin" is necessary to avoid marginal misses. Using the CT-linear accelerator combination in the treatment suite (Primatom, Siemens), we found that the daily intrinsic prostate movements can be easily corrected before each radiotherapy session. Dosimetric calculations were performed to evaluate the amount of discrepancy of dose to the target if no correction was done for prostate movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Primatom consists of a Siemens Somatom CT scanner and a Siemens Primus linear accelerator installed in the same treatment suite and sharing a common table/couch. The patient is scanned by the CT scanner, which is movable on a pair of horizontal rails. During scanning, the couch does not move. The exact location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and rectum are identified and localized. These positions are then compared with the planned positions. The daily movement of the prostate and rectum were corrected for and a new isocenter derived. The patient was treated immediately using the new isocenter. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients with primary prostate cancer studied, 540 consecutive daily CT scans were performed during the last part of the cone down treatment. Of the 540 scans, 46% required no isocenter adjustments for the AP-PA direction, 54% required a shift of > or =3 mm, 44% required a shift of >5 mm, and 15% required a shift of >10 mm. In the superoinferior direction, 27% required a shift of >3 mm, 25% required a shift of >5 mm, and 4% required a shift of >10 mm. In the right-left direction, 34% required a shift of >3 mm, 24% required a shift of >5 mm, and 5% required a shift of >10 mm. Dosimetric calculations for a typical case of prostate cancer using intensity-modulated radiotherapy with 5-mm margin coverage from the clinical target volume (prostate gland) was performed. With a posterior shift of 10 mm for the prostate, the dose coverage dropped from 95-107% to 71-100% coverage. CONCLUSION: We have described a technique that corrects for the daily prostate motion, allowing for extremely precise prostate cancer treatment. This technique has significant implications for dose escalation and for decreasing rectal complications in the treatment of prostate cancer

Autopsy findings in 15 of these patients are reported. Ten patients received pituitary radiation (average dose, 116 Gy in six fractions) for progressive neovascularization retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus. Evidence of a time-dependent course of progressive fibrosis in their pituitary glands was found. Five patients were treated for eosinophilic adenomas. Although they had lower average doses of radiation (56 Gy in six fractions), their pituitary glands showed cystic cavitation of the adenomas. The adenomas thus appeared more radiosensitive than the normal pars anterior, which, in turn, was more radiosensitive than the adjacent neurohypophysis. No significant radiation changes were found in the surrounding brain or cranial nerves. The endocrine organs under pituitary control showed varying degrees of atrophy, and clinical tests revealed progressive hypofunction. It was concluded that charged-particle therapy produced a sharply delineated focal radiation lesion confined to the pituitary gland but did not cause injury to the critical structures of the surrounding central nervous system

This represents the largest group evaluated histologically in the literature and is the first report evaluating effects of particle radiation in pancreatic tissue. Patient survival after therapy averaged 9 months. Most died of infection and/or pulmonary emboli. Local control was achieved in 27%. The pancreatic tumors had histologically more severe radiation changes than nontumor bearing pancreas. Irradiated bone marrow was severely hypocellular, and irradiated skin was atrophic. Five patients had radiation injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal cord, liver, and kidneys showed no damage. This study demonstrates the safety of helium particle irradiation with present therapeutic planning. Injury to tumor was seen without excessive damage to adjacent tissues

This technique allows treatment of small (less than 40 mm diameter) intracranial lesions, including vascular malformations, and primary and metastatic tumors that are deep within the brain or in areas not amenable to open surgery. A beam of ionizing radiation (1800 to 2500 cGy) is focused on the center of the lesion, which is determined by stereotactic localization. "Dynamic rotation" of the linac gantry and table continuously about this predetermined point ensures that only the lesion receives the full radiation dose, while the normal structures in the head receive minimal amounts of radiation. The system combines, for the first time in one place, elements of radiosurgical technique developed at various centers. Testing for accuracy compares favorably with results at other centers using linac-based systems as well as comparing favorably with the gamma knife

METHODS: From 1970 to 2001, 40 patients with primary tracheal carcinoma treated in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight were male and 12 were female with median age of 47 years. The median interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 10 months (1 - 60 months). Fifteen patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma, 14 squamous cell carcinoma, 8 adenocarcinoma, 2 small-cell carcinoma and 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Thirty-two patients received operation plus adjuvant radiotherapy, 6 received radiotherapy alone and 2 received operation alone. RESULTS: The median survival time for all patients was 40 months. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate was 86%, 59% and 29%, respectively. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year local control rate was 84%, 60% and 50%, respectively. Distant metastasis rate in 1, 5, and 10 years was 17%, 51% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy is a reasonable mode of treatment. Despite late local recurrence after initial treatment, its intrinsic feature, excellent long-term palliation can be achieved after treatment

This study was to evaluate prognostic factors of patients with cerebral glioma treated with radiotherapy. METHODS: Records of 158 patients with cerebral glioma, including 123 patients with astrocytoma (AC), 12 patients with oligodendroglioma (OD) or mixed oligoastrocytoma (OA), and 23 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), received radiotherapy in our center were analyzed. Eighty patients received total resection, 77 received subtotal resection, and 1 received biopsy before radiotherapy. Median radiation dose was 58 Gy (36-75 Gy). Median waiting time from operation to radiotherapy was 29 days (12-261 days). Sixty-eight patients received chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy. Cox model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23 months (2-62 months), 27 patients relapsed, and 57 patients died. The 2- and 4-year overall survival rate were 66.5% and 45.7%. Univariate analysis showed that histologic grade (I/II vs. II/IV), histologic type (AC/OD vs. GBM), Karnofsky performance state (KPS) before radiotherapy (>/=80 vs.< 80), extent of resection (total vs non-total), and age(</=40 years vs. >40 years) were significant predictors in association with overall survival rate of patients with glioma. Multivariate analysis showed that histologic grade (P=0.001), age (P=0.006), KPS before radiotherapy (P=0.009), and extent of resection (P=0.037) were independent prognostic factors of glioma. CONCLUSION: Low grade (I/II), age </=40 years, KPS>/=80 before radiotherapy, and total resection are independent factors for predicting better survival of glioma patients

This study was to evaluate the correlation of GHR expression to radiosensitivity of rectal cancer. METHODS: The expression of GHR in biopsy specimens from 98 rectal cancer patients before preoperative irradiation and postoperative specimens was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Radiosensitivity was evaluated according to Rectal Cancer Regression Grading. RESULTS: IHC revealed that GHR overexpression was positively correlated to poor response to radiotherapy (P<0.001, rs=0.399); RT-PCR also showed that radiosensitivity was significantly higher in GHR mRNA-negative group than in GHR mRNA-positive group (P<0.001, rs=0.398). Compared with the biopsy specimens before preoperative irradiation, the paired postoperative specimens showed significantly increased GHR expression in residual cancer cells (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Detection of GHR expression before preoperative irradiation may predict radiosensitivity of rectal cancer

This study was designed to evaluate the QOL of disease-freely survival NPC patients after treatment, and to investigate the factors correlated with their QOL. METHODS: From Jul. to Aug. 2003, disease-freely survival NPC patients who had been treated from 1999 to 2000 in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University were enrolled. The Chinese SF-36 questionnaire and a checklist consists of 14 items about self-rating symptoms were self-reported by all participants at clinic. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the patients were also collected, and their relationships with SF-36 data and symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were enrolled in the study. The median survival time was 3.6 years (ranged 2.4-4.6 years). Xerostomia was the first common symptom, followed by hypoacusis, hypomnesia, dysphagia, and trismus. Univariate analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, monthly income, economic status, religion, and the number of complications had influences on QOL; the patients in earlier T and N stages, irradiated by linear accelerator, with lower total dose and weekly dosage to the nasopharynx and neck, and those who had anterior nasal field radiation reported better QOL. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the number of complications, monthly income, age, and T stage were independent factors affecting total QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Improving radiotherapy might enhance physical functions of NPC patients. The prevention and control of chronic diseases, the development of economy, and the increase of income may promote NPC patients' QOL

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas

This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHODS: A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514). CONCLUSION: Dose boost in skull base can reduce the recurrence of stage T4 NPC in skull base and tends to enhance the disease-freely survival rate for NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvementu it is recommended to such patients

We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC	
1	681	Detection and differentiation of lactate and lipids by single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy	Aged, Algorithms, Brain Chemistry, Brain Neoplasms/ch [Chemistry], Brain Neoplasms/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Glioblastoma/ch [Chemistry], Glioblastoma/su [Surgery], Humans, Lactic Acid/ch [Chemistry], Lipids/ch [Chemistry], Logistic Models, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Meningioma/ch [Chemistry], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Neurosurgical Procedures, Protons, Radiosurgery, Time	The signals of lactate and lipids partially overlap in single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS), sometimes making them difficult to differentiate in clinical settings. Our aim in this study was to identify lactate and lipids by varying the echo time (TE). We expect that the accurate detection of lactate and lipids will have high diagnostic value in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Following our protocol, we obtained meaningful 1HMRS spectra from 213 patients, including 163 patients with brain tumors, between August 1999 and February 2004. 1HMRS was performed with a TE of 144 ms followed by a TE of 30 ms and/or a TE of 288 ms, if necessary. For the 213 patients, lactate level was "negative" in 47 patients, "positive" in 131 patients, and "strongly positive" in 35 patients. The lipid level was "negative" in 90 patients, "positive" in 56 patients, and "strongly positive" in 67 patients. Based on logistic discriminant analyses of neuro-epithelial tumor WHO grade and lactate and lipid levels, lactate and lipid levels were significant between WHO grades 2 and 3 (P=0.0239) and between grades 3 and 4 (P=0.0347). Lipids are a more significant factor for the discrimination between WHO grades 2 and 3 (P=0.0073) and between grades 3 and 4 (P=0.0048). With our method of varying the TE, it is possible accurately and efficiently to detect lactate and lipids in the brain. We found a significant correlation between lactate and lipid expression and WHO grade of neuro-epithelial tumors

To revisit the mechanism of carcinogenesis by Thorotrast (THR), we examined the tissue distribution of THR granules and two-dimensional distribution of radioactivity in the organs of Thorotrastosis patients and studied their spatial relationship to histopathological changes. The high radioactivity in the patients' organ was predominantly derived from decay of Thorium series and showed unique distribution, while the far lower natural radioactivity was mainly from Uranium series decay and fairly evenly distributed. It was found that a large majority of THR granules were phagocytized by macrophages and were embedded in extensive fibrosis. Cancer was rarely in the center of THR deposition but rather at a distance from the deposits. These observations may indicate that the predominant feature of THR deposition is the tissue damage by direct hit of alpha-particles and subsequent fibrosis. The effect of THR resembles action of toxic chemical agents, as several authors have pointed out. We therefore assume that carcinogenesis in Thorotrastosis is a combination of events, such as regeneration of liver tissue after radiation damage, emission of secondary electrons, ionization of the surrounding tissue, and beta- or gamma-ray from daughter nuclei of Thorium (Th). In this context, the role of alpha-particle is important but more intriguing

Although the importance of the area of irradiated lung is well known, the irradiated area of mediastinum is little to be considered in the routine treatment. PURPOSE: To evaluate the significance of the irradiated area of the mediastinum in the simulation film for radiation induced lung injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients with primary lung cancer treated with radiation therapy were analyzed for incidence of radiation induced lung injury. Lung injury was defined as the appearance of an abnormal shadow on the chest radiograph. CT images were used to differentiate recurrence or other conditions. Age, sex, irradiation dose, irradiated lung area, T and N factors of the tumor, irradiated mediastinum area, performance status of patients, location of irradiated fields and use of chemotherapy were analyzed with Cox's multivariate regression model. RESULTS: The cumulative rate of radiation induced lung injury at 12 months was 85%. Significant factor of radiation induced lung injury was irradiated area of the mediastinum (p = 0.03). Irradiated area of the lung (p = 0.18, n.s.), total tumor dose (p = 0.1, n.s.), use of chemotherapy (p = 0.08, n.s.) and location of irradiated field (p = 0.08, n.s.) may also have an effect on radiation induced lung injury. CONCLUSION: The irradiated area of the mediastinum is one of the significant factors in radiation induced lung injury	
1	1164	[Heavy charged particles radiotherapy--mainly carbon ion beams]. [Review] [12 refs] [Japanese]	Carbon, Dose Fractionation, Fast Neutrons, Female, Heavy Ions, Helium, Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Neon, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, X-Rays	Carbon ion beams have superior dose distribution allowing selective irradiation to the tumor while minimizing irradiation to the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions produce an increased density of local energy deposition with high-energy transfer (LET) components, resulting in radiobiological advantages. Stimulated by the favorable results in fast neutrons, helium ions, and neon ions, a clinical trial of carbon ion therapy was begun at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in 1994. Carbon ions were generated by a medically dedicated accelerator (HIMAC, Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan), which was the world's first heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. In general, patients were selected for treatment when their tumors could not be expected to respond favorably to conventional forms of therapy. A total of 1601 patients were registered in this clinical trial so far. The normal tissue reactions were acceptable, and there were no carbon related deaths. Carbon ion radiotherapy seemed to be a clinically feasible curative treatment modality, and appears to offer improved results not only over conventional X-rays but also even over surgery in some selected carcinomas.

Several authors have described mixed or transitional vascular malformations with pathological features of more than one type of malformation within the same lesion. We present a rare case of a venous malformation associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with a loss of consciousness. Computed tomography showed an enlarged vein running along the lateral wall of the right lateral ventricle. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated an AVM and a venous malformation in the right hemisphere; the AVM and the venous malformation were located in proximity to each other with the AVM using the venous malformation as its draining vein. In this case, where an AVM used the venous malformation as the draining vein, only the AVM was treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated complete obliteration of the AVM with the venous malformation remaining unchanged. CONCLUSION: Arteriovenous shunting would have disturbed venous drainage resulting in the development of the venous malformation. Thus, in addition to demonstrating a rare coexistence of AVM and venous malformation, this case also offers a new insight into the pathogenesis of these vascular malformations. [References: 19]

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma

This is mainly due to the differences in internal radiosensitivity. This study was to analyze the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and lymphogenesis of tumor cells, and to explore the correlation of these factors to radiosensitivity. METHODS: P53 protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein, survivin protein, VEGF-C protein, Ki67 protein, and microvascular density (MVD) of 60 biopsy samples from radiosensitive group and 60 from radio-resistant group were detected by immunohistochemistry, respectively. Their correlations to clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rates of P53, VEGF, survivin, VEGF-C, Ki67 were 65.0%, 57.5%, 60.8%, 42.5%, 57.5%, respectively. The positive rates of P53 and VEGF, and MVD in the radio-sensitive group and in the radio-resistant group were (25.97+/-21.26)%, (18.50+/-19.86)%, 32.65+/-19.61 and (37.85+/-28.67)%, (30.83+/-23.94)%, 41.95+/-16.97, respectively (P<0.05). The positive rates of Survivin, VEGF-C, and Ki67 between the two groups had no statistic difference (P>0.05). The correlations between P53, VEGF, and MVD were obvious. CONCLUSION: P53 protein, VEGF protein and MVD might be biomolecular markers for evaluating the internal radiosensitivity of NPC patients	
1	639	Proton radiotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcome and a dosimetric comparison with photons	Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Massachusetts, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Over 85% of pediatric orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are cured with combined chemotherapy and radiation. However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects	
1	4484	Phase I/II study of proton beam irradiation for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration: treatment techniques and preliminary results	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Angiography, Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Humans, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Methods, Morbidity, Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Reading, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration is the prevalent etiology of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The only effective treatment is laser photocoagulation, which is associated with decreased visual acuity following treatment in most patients. This study assessed both the response of subfoveal CNV to proton beam irradiation and treatment-related morbidity. We evaluated preliminary results in patients treated with an initial dose of 8 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) using a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with subfoveal CNV received proton irradiation to the central macula with a single fraction of 8 CGE; 19 were eligible for evaluation. Treatment-related morbidity was based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria; response was evaluated by Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) guidelines. Fluorescein angiography was performed; visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and reading speed were measured at study entry and at 3-month intervals after treatment. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 15 months. RESULTS: No measurable treatment-related morbidity was seen during or after treatment. Of 19 patients evaluated at 6 months, fluorescein angiography demonstrated treatment response in 10 (53%); 14 (74%) patients had improved or stable visual acuity. With a mean follow-up of 11.6 months, 11 (58%) patients have demonstrated improved or stable visual acuity. CONCLUSION: A macular dose of 8 CGE yielded no measurable treatment morbidity in patients studied. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated that regressed or stabilized lesions were associated with improved visual acuity as compared with MPS results. In the next phase, a dose of 14 CGE in a single fraction will be used to further define the optimal dose fractionation schedule

This report is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred and six patients in stages T2b (B2), T2c (B2), and T3 (C) were treated with 45 Gy photon-beam irradiation to the pelvis and an additional 30 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) to the prostate with 250-MeV protons, yielding a total prostate dose of 75 CGE in 40 fractions. Median follow-up time was 20.2 months (range: 10-30 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system; local control was evaluated by serial digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements. RESULTS: Morbidity evaluation was available on 104 patients. The actuarial 2-year rate of Grade 1 or 2 late morbidity was 12% (8% rectal, 4% urinary). No patients demonstrated Grade 3 or 4 late morbidity. Treatment response was evaluated on 100 patients with elevated pretreatment serum PSA levels. The actuarial 2-year rate of PSA normalization was 96%, 97%, and 63% for pretreatment PSAs of > 4-10, > 10-20, and > 20, respectively. The 13 patients with rising PSA demonstrated local recurrence (3 patients), distant metastasis (8 patients), or no evidence of disease except increasing PSA (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of side effects, despite the tumor dose of 75 CGE, demonstrates that conformal protons can deliver higher doses of radiation to target tissues without increasing complications to surrounding normal tissues. The initial tumor response, as assessed by the high actuarial rate of normalization with pretreatment PSA < or = 20, and the low rate of recurrences within the treatment field (2.8%), are encouraging

Radiation induced change (RIC) developed within the irradiated field 40-60 months after doses of 800-1000 neuNSD or 70 TDF and in 10-20 months after doses of more than 1700 neuNSD or 100 TDF. The incidence of RIC increased significantly with increasing age. Furthermore pathological changes like oedema and infarction in the brain tissue may be an important factor for the development of RIC in the central nervous system (CNS)

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass 10 cm in diameter in the region of the middle clivus enhanced inhomogeneously by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and a defect in the skull base. There was evidence of compression of the anterior surface of the pons. He received proton irradiation employing a pair of parallel opposed lateral proton beams. The dose aimed at the tumor mass was 75.5 Gy, to the pharyngeal wall less than 38 Gy, and to the anterior portion of the pons less than 30 Gy. Time dose and fractionation factor was calculated at 148. Thirty-one months following treatment, he was free of clinical neurological sequelae. Proton therapy should be considered in treatment planning following initial surgical removal or for inoperable clivus chordoma

The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury	
1	2189	Superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging for early and late radiation-induced hepatic injuries	Aged, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Contrast Media, Contrast Media/me [Metabolism], Female, Ferric Compounds/me [Metabolism], Humans, Iron, Japan, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver/in [Injuries], Liver/re [Radiation Effects], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy, Universities	Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MRI was performed in twenty-one patients undergoing proton-beam radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinomas. Patients were divided into two groups: early and late phase hepatic injuries. Each group was investigated 3 to 9 weeks and 4 to 65 months after the start of irradiation, respectively. T(1)-weighted, T(2)-weighted, and T(2)*-weighted images were obtained before and after SPIO administration. In all postcontrast sequences in the early phase, irradiated livers demonstrated relatively higher intensity than nonirradiated livers and the radiation-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) was improved. Postcontrast T(2)*-weighted images showed the highest C/N. In the late phase, the irradiated areas showed high intensity on T(2)-weighted images and low intensity on T(1)-weighted images without SPIO, while high intensity on T(1)-weighted images with SPIO. The C/N increased with SPIO in all sequences and postcontrast T(2)-weighted images showed the highest C/N in the late phase. SPIO-enhanced MRI is useful to evaluate this entity both in the early and late phase of clinical studies

Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation

Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been recognized as a clinicopathologic entity distinct from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapy, and prognosis of ESCC. METHODS: The medical records, from Jan. 1985 to Dec. 2005, of 53 patients with pathologically proved ESCC were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 39 were men and 14 were women, with the median age of 53 years (range, 27-76 years). Of the 53 cases of ESCC, 33 (62.3%) were detected in the esophagus, 5 in the cervix, 4 in the larynx, 3 in the pharynx, 2 in the upper sinus, 2 in the rectum and sublingual gland, 1 in the thyroid gland, 1 in the pleura, and 1 in the liver. Forty patients (75.5%) had limited disease (LD) and 13 (24.5%) had extensive disease (ED). Patients with ED mostly received platinum-based chemotherapy, for which the response rate was 69.2%. Patients with LD were treated with a variety of therapeutic modalities: 7 were treated with surgery plus radiochemotherapy, 3 with surgery plus radiotherapy, 18 with surgery plus chemotherapy, 6 with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, 4 with radiotherapy alone, and 2 with chemotherapy alone. The median survival time (MST) was 20 months for all patients, and the 1-and 3-year survival rates were 41.3% and 31.4%. MST for patients with ED and LD were 15 months and 26 months, respectively, and 1-and 3-year survival rates were 51.1% vs. 14.4%, and 42.5% vs. 0% (P=0.017 ). CONCLUSIONS: ESCC is identified in various sites, with the most common primary site being the esophagus. Multimodality therapy has become increasingly used for the majority of patients with LD-ESCC. Combination chemotherapy has been a major treatment for patients with ED-ESCC. Generally, the prognosis of LD-ESCC is significantly superior to ED-ESCC

1	885	Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children	California, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Count, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pilot Projects, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

In cases of acute leukemia and different accumulated doses of external radiation (from 0.20 to 4.00 Sv), the proton spectra were classified on the basis of the peaks due to N-trimethyl groups, creatinine, citrate, glycine, and hippurate. Unidentified resonances were observed between 15.9 and 21.4 ppm in six phosphorus spectra of patients with preleukemia and acute leukemia. Characteristic spectral changes were similar for external radiation and incorporation-induced internal irradiation. The spectral patterns described may serve as a criterion of radiation injury

The aim of this study was to improve a conventional treatment plan by modifying the dose intensity in the beams to reduce the absorbed dose outside the planning target volume (PTV) and to reduce the absorbed dose variation inside the PTV diotherapy of mammary carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment planning was performed both with conventional technique and with a simple intensity modulation technique for 12 consecutive patients. RESULTS: In all cases a higher degree of dose conformity was obtained with the dose intensity modulation technique. The relative gain was found to be similar for all patients irrespective of the size of the target volume or the irradiated lung volume. CONCLUSION: Simple manual intensity modulation can be used to improve the dose distribution in tangential breast irradiation. With modern accelerators the increased time for this technique is less than 2 min per fraction

Radionuclides that decay by the emission of alpha-particles such as the heavy halogen astatine-211 (211At) offer the exciting prospect of combining cell-specific molecular targets with radiation having a range in tissue of only a few cell diameters. Herein, the radiobiological advantages of alpha-particle targeted radiotherapy will be reviewed, and the rationale for using 211At for this purpose will be described. The chemistry of astatine is similar to that of iodine; however, there are important differences which make the synthesis and evaluation of 211At-labeled compounds more challenging. Perhaps the most successful approach that has been developed involves the astatodemetallation of tin, silicon or mercury precursors. Astatine-211 labeled agents that have been investigated for targeted radiotherapy include [211At]astatide, 211At- labeled particulates, 211At-labeled naphthoquinone derivatives, 211At-labeled methylene blue, 211At-labeled DNA precursors, meta-[211At]astatobenzylguanidine, 211At-labeled biotin conjugates, 211At-labeled bisphosphonates, and 211At-labeled antibodies and antibody fragments. The status of these 211At-labeled compounds will be discussed in terms of their labeling chemistry, cytotoxicity in cell culture, as well as their tissue distribution and therapeutic efficacy in animal models of human cancers. Finally, an update on the status of the first clinical trial with an 211At-labeled targeted therapeutic, 211At-labeled chimeric anti-tenascin antibody 81C6, will be provided. [References: 104]

DESIGN: Randomized dose-ranging clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with angiographic evidence of classic choroidal neovascularization resulting from AMD and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better. METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 16-cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) or 24-CGE proton radiation in 2 equal fractions. Visual acuity was measured using standardized protocol refraction. Complete ophthalmological examinations, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of eyes losing 3 or more lines of vision from baseline. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare cumulative rates of vision loss between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS: At 12 months after treatment, 36 eyes (42%) and 27 eyes (35%) lost 3 or more lines of vision in the 16-CGE and 24-CGE groups, respectively. Rates increased to 62% in the 16-CGE group and 53% in the 24-CGE group by 24 months after treatment (P = 0.40). Radiation complications developed in 15.7% of patients receiving 16 CGE and 14.8% of patients receiving 24 CGE. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in rates of visual loss were found between the 2 dose groups. Proton radiation may be useful as an adjuvant therapy or as an alternative for patients who decline or are not appropriate for approved therapies

METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with peripheral arterial disease, who were treated with "bail-out" stent implantation in the superficial femoral artery due to suboptimal PTA, were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving either external beam irradiation (6 MV photons, total dose 24 Gy in a hypofractionated schedule) plus antiplatelet therapy (EBI group) or antiplatelet therapy alone (control group). RESULTS: No procedure-related complications occurred, and all patients of the EBI group received the full dose of 24 Gy. During the long-term follow-up, an overall statistically significant difference was demonstrated in favor of the EBI group patients, regarding both the in-stent (log-rank test, p = 0.0072) and the in-segment binary restenosis (log-rank test, p = 0.0103). The primary patency rates were also significantly better in the EBI group at specific time-points, such as in the first (74.2% vs 46.5%, p = 0.019), second (62.5% vs 33.8%, p = 0.020), and third (54.6% vs 29.0%, p = 0.039) year, respectively. Moreover, the overall clinically driven reintervention rate was significantly lower among patients of the irradiated group (log-rank test, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Our long-term follow-up analysis revealed that EBI following femoral artery PTA and stenting significantly reduces restenosis and reintervention rates, while improving primary patency

The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and February 1998, 21 patients suffering from uveal melanomas have been treated with stereotactic 6 MeV LINAC (Saturne 43, General Electric, France) in conjunction with a stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB, Germany). Immobilization of the eye was ensured with an optical fixation system which was proven reliable. During radiotherapy, movements of the irradiated eye were controlled on a monitor and documented by video recording. All patients co-operated very well with the optical fixation system. In 1164 measurements, the median value of horizontal deviation of the diseased eye during treatment was 0.3 mm (range: 0 to 1.3 mm). Median vertical deviation was 0.2 mm (range: 0 to 1.2 mm). For all patients, mean tumor prominence before treatment was 6.0 +/- 2.2 mm. In 20 patients, the total dose of 70 Gy (at 80%) was delivered in 5 fractions within 10 days. In one patient with a ciliary body tumor, the total dose of 70 Gy was divided into 7 fractions for better sparing of the anterior eye segment. RESULTS: After a follow-up of at least 6 months, local tumor control was seen in all eyes. Mean tumor thickness reduction after 3, 6 and 9 months was 7%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Up to now, only mild subacute side-effects located in the anterior eye segment have been noticed. CONCLUSION: Optical fixation of the eye allows high precision stereotactic radiotherapy with small safety margins. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and 70 Gy total dose delivered in 5 fractions seems to be appropriate for local tumor control in uveal melanoma. Further long-term studies with extended number of patients will be necessary to conclude on the use of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma

This is the first trial to investigate the utility of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the imaging of chordoma before and after carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with chordoma were investigated with MET-PET before and after CIRT and the findings analyzed visually and quantitatively. Tumor MET uptake was evaluated by tumor-to-nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). RESULTS: In 12 (80%) patients chordoma was clearly visible in the baseline MET-PET study with a mean T/N ratio of 3.3+/-1.7. The MET uptake decreased significantly to 2.3+/-1.4 after CIRT ( P<0.05). A significant reduction in tumor MET uptake of 24% was observed after CIRT. Fourteen (93%) patients showed no local recurrence after CIRT with a median follow-up time of 20 months. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that MET-PET is feasible for imaging of chordoma. MET-PET could provide important tumor metabolic information for the therapeutic monitoring of chordoma after CIRT

We evaluated whether L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake and its change after CIRT were the early survival predictors in patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MET positron emission tomography was prospectively performed in 62 patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas before and within 1 month after CIRT. Tumor MET uptake was measured with the semiquantitative tumor:nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). The MET uptake in the tumor and relevant clinical parameters were entered into univariate and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 20 months. Patients with a baseline T/N ratio of <or=6 had a significant better survival than patients with a baseline T/N ratio >6 (2-year survival rate: 69.4% versus 32.3%; P = 0.01). Patients with a post-CIRT ratio of <or=4.4 had a better survival than that with a post-CIRT ratio >4.4 (2-year survival rate: 63.7% versus 41.3%; P = 0.01). A significant higher survival rate was observed in patients with post-therapeutic MET uptake change of >30% than patients in lower change group (2-year survival rate: 74.6% versus 41.6%; P = 0.049). The multivariate analysis showed that both baseline and post-CIRT T/N ratio were statistically significant independent predictors of patient survival. Tumors with larger T/N ratio had a significantly poorer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: MET uptake as measured by either baseline or post-CIRT T/N ratio was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherapy, whereas post-therapeutic MET uptake change might have potential value for the same purpose

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities

These patients were treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the latter being CO60 or 8 MEV Linac. The protocol for treatment is the following: 1) Chemotherapy, randomized into two groups COF (Cytoxan, Vincristin, and 5-fluorouracil) and COFP (Cytoxan, Vincristin, 5-Fu and Procabazine). 2) Radiotherapy with 2 split courses. In the rest period chemotherapy was given as randomized above for COF and COFP groups, but drugs given only once in this rest period, followed by the whole course of radiotherapy using same drugs as above, but only once a month for at least 2 years. The 1-year survival rates were 63.1% and 57.8% respectively, 2-year survival rates were 21% for both programs, and 3-year survival rates were 10.5% for both programs also. Therefore, we believe that procarbazine does not play a very important role in the program, and can be dispensed with. Compared with international reports, the efficacy of COF and COFP programs is as good as any other of the combined chemotherapy programs in the world. These programs may be of more benefit to the patients because of the very mild toxicity and very low cost. In this study the extent of the lesion was found to play important role in prognosis, in other words, the earlier the stage the better the results, just as for other solid tumors. Median survival time in Stage II groups is 20 months, the 1-year survival rate is 81.8% (8/11), 2-year survival rate is 45.4% (5/11), while in Stage III groups median survival time is 11.5 months, the 1-year survival rate is 57.1% (13/21), and 2-year survival rate is 14.2% (2/21). Because the survival time exceeded 18 months, there are 10 of 15 patients alive and without evidence of disease (66.6%), and 6 of 8 patients alive over 24 months without evidence of disease (75%).

A prolonged remission was noted in 75-90% of the patients with pituitary adenomas. Angiography showed complete exclusion of aneurysm from the blood flow 2 yrs. after irradiation almost in 50% of the patients with arteriovenous malformations.

For intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the "hand calculation" becomes not feasible due to the sophisticated multileaf collimator (MLC) segments created for intensity-modulated dose delivery. Therefore, an independent computerized dose calculation routine is needed for fast and reliable dose verification. In this work, a point dose calculation routine for IMRS/IMRT plan verification is developed by directly applying Clarkson's method. The method includes preparing data table by measuring TPRs for circular fields with diameters ranging 6 to 98 mm, extrapolating TPR for the zero field size (TPR0) from measured data and generating scatter phantom ratio (SPR) for each individual circular field. The segmented MLC sequences created by IMRS/IMRT inverse planning are converted into irregular fields for Clarkson's calculation. This method has been tested using 29 IMRS/IMRT cases. The results indicate that it is reliable, fast, and accurate. The average time to calculate one field is about 2 s with a 300 Mhz CPU

Radiation of the pituitary with a proton beam in a dose of 70-100 Gy (7000-10000 rad) performed according to the indicated technique appeared highly effective. It was not associated with local or total radiation injuries and was safe. X-ray therapy conducted according to the fractionally intensive technique in a dose of 3000-3500 rad was less effective and produced disease relapses more frequently as compared with proton therapy

The use of the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was found to be effective for the treatment of children with mild and average forms of ICD. Irradiation of the pituitary gland at a dose of 70-100 Gy is accompanied by general and local radiation reactions which are not dangerous for children. The time of development of remission after irradiation depends on a degree of severity and features of a course of disease

It was shown that especially chronic side effects are benign in most of all cases. Severe - but not vitally dangerous - complications in bladder and intestine are rare (3%); their percentage corresponds roughly to the average mortality rate of surgical intervention (radical prostatectomy). Contrary to operation, troubles of the sexual function appear only in one third of the patients. Taking into consideration the similar therapeutic results of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, radiotherapy is more favorable with respect to side effects. This essential aspect should be considered when making a decision whether to apply a surgical or a radiotherapeutic treatment treatment

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Thirty-two men (44 to 80 years old) with locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate (stage B2 or C) have been treated by 3D-planned conformal radiotherapy using high energy photons. In 28/32 men treatment technique was a monoaxial bisegmental rotation with irregular fields. With single doses of 2.0 Gy a mean total dose of 63.9 +/- 4.9 Gy according to ICRU was applied within 46 +/- 4 days. Maximum dose was in the mean 105.1% +/- 3.8%. 3D treatment volume was 274.1 +/- 113.4 cm3. Median follow-up is 1.8 years (15 to 34 months). Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC by patient interview and physical examination on a weekly basis during radiotherapy and by regular follow-up. RESULTS: Eleven patients had none, 15 mild (RTOG grade 1) and 6 moderate symptoms (RTOG grade 2, mainly diarrhoea, dysuria and polyuria). Acute complications leading to treatment interruption did not occur. In 16 patients symptoms disappeared within 6 weeks after radiotherapy. Only 2 men had symptoms which lasted longer than 3 months and were endoscopically examined. Up to now no late complications were detected. Incidence and severity of toxicity was significantly (p < 0.05) related to the size of treatment volume. Acute toxicity was found to depend statistically significant (p < 0.05) on the proportional volume of bladder and rectum, irradiated with more than 35 Gy. In 81% of the patients with pretherapeutic elevated PSA levels normalisation of PSA was observed. Overall mean PSA levels of 15.7 +/- 22.6 micrograms/l at the beginning of radiotherapy fell to 2.1 +/- 3.7 micrograms/l 6 weeks after irradiation. Only 1 Patient relapsed locally 22 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: We conclude that due to modern 3D-planned conformal techniques with optimization of treatment dose and improved protection of critical organs such as urinary bladder and rectum, radiotherapy allows an effective and well tolerated therapy of localized prostatic carcinoma	
1	683	Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a randomized controlled trial.[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/bl [Blood], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Research, Risk, Survival Rate	CONTEXT: Clinically localized prostate cancer is very prevalent among US men, but recurrence after treatment with conventional radiation therapy is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 61.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.6%-68.3%) for conventional-dose and 80.4% (95% confidence interval, 74.7%-86.1%) for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 49% reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was observed in both the low-risk and the higher-risk subgroups (risk reduction, 51% [P<.001] and 44% [P = .03], respectively). There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity

A five-field 18 MV photon treatment plan, selected to minimize lung dose, is compared with helium ions using the same field configuration. Dose volume histograms show target coverage, as well as dose delivered to critical structures lung, heart, mediastinum, and spinal cord. Although both helium ions and photons deliver approximately the same lung dose for this treatment plan, radiation to the heart and spinal cord from this field arrangement is significantly reduced with the helium ion beam. The concentration of dose at the tumor site, while sparing surrounding normal tissue, is characteristic of charged particle therapy, particularly with light ions, which includes particles with Z from that of protons (Z = 1) through that of neon (Z = 10)

After an apparent failure of the tumor to respond, the eye was enucleated. A predominantly epithelioid cell tumor appeared viable by light microscopy, and a low degree of mitotic activity persisted, despite therapy. The tumor cells, however, displayed degenerative changes ultrastructurally, presumably results of the radiotherapy. These consisted of numerous cytoskeletal filaments, lipid vacuoles, prominent phagolysosomes, and nuclear convolutions and fragmentations. The mitochondria were fewer in number in the present tumor than typically encountered in epithelioid cells. A rare leptomeric structure was discovered, probably an organizational modification of the cytoplasmic filaments. The tumor's capillaries showed radiation-induced changes in terms of thickened basement membranes and perivascular fibrin deposition. The foregoing features are indicative of cellular and metabolic injury from the radiotherapy, but these were evidently not sufficiently injurious to sterilize the tumor

Life expectancy following conservative treatment is equal to or better than that following enucleation. This is demonstrated by nonrandomized comparative studies, and by the authors' own long-term results following the conservative treatment of melanomas by 60Co applicators: mortality due to metastases of small melanomas was 3% (V = smaller than 10 x 10 x 3 mm), with medium-size melanomas it was 12% (V = 10 x 10 x 3-15 x 15 x 5 mm), and with large melanomas 21% (V = larger than 15 x 15 x 5 mm). Accelerated proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas is currently the method of choice for the conservative treatment of uveal melanomas. The sharp boundaries of the irradiated zone, the uniformly distributed irradiation dose, and beam-splitting are the main advantages of this technique. During the last three years, 310 cases of uveal melanoma have been treated in Switzerland with an accelerated proton beam. Of these, 214 were followed up for more than one year. Eight patients (3.9%) died of metastases. Visual acuity was identical or superior to initial visual acuity in 60.3% of the cases, while 39.6% exhibited a deterioration of vision or a functional loss. Favorable results achieved by conservative treatment of uveal melanomas considerably limited the indications for enucleation, which is now only performed in exceptional situations

This total is made of 20 men and 17 women aged between 19 and 81 years with a mean age of 54.7 years. Tumors were localized in the bulbar conjunctival in 27 cases, in the palpebral conjunctival in 2 cases and were diffuse in 8 cases. Cornea was infiltrated in 19 cases. In 21 cases, the first treatment was made in our service and 16 cases were recurrences following a treatment made elsewhere. The mortality rate to 5 years was 20%. In a multivariant analysis using the COX Model, the height of the tumor was the only significant parameter (p = 0.035) for life expectancy. Recurrence of the tumor (p = 0.060) and presence of a PAM (p = 0.652) were not significant parameters. Benefits of cryocoagulation and indications for a proton beam irradiation are discussed

The rate of recurrence is particularly high in cases of large size tumor, of widespread tumors and with PAM associated lesions. Tumor recurrences have a bad long-term prognostic significance and often necessitate exenteration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A method of therapy combining total surgical excision with proton-beam irradiation, cobalt plaque irradiation and cryotherapy is described. This technique is used in particular unfavorable cases with the aim of lowering the rate of recurrences. It was practiced in 19 cases in Lausanne, 10 of which were recurrent tumors. The melanoma invaded 3 quadrants of the bulbar conjunctiva in 8 cases and 4 quadrants in 11 cases. At least one neighbouring tarsal conjunctiva was invaded in 11 cases and both in 7 cases. The skin of the eyelid was infiltrated in 6 cases and the caruncle in 9 cases. Tumor thickness was 1 to 2 mm in 8 cases, 3 to 4 mm in 4 cases and 5 to 10 mm in 7 cases. RESULTS: PAM was present in 16 cases. Follow-up period was less than 1 year in 2 cases, between 1 to 2 years in 5 cases, between 2 to 3 years in 5 cases and more than 3 years in 7 cases. 5 patients had lymph node metastases, 3 died of metastatic disease and 2 had a local recurrence. One of these recurrences was small-sized and was excised, the other was widespread and the patient died soon with metastatic disease. No exenteration was performed. CONCLUSION: The method of therapy that is here described appears to be a valuable alternative to exenteration of the orbit for the treatment of diffuse or large-size conjunctival melanomas which have a high risk of local recurrence

Over the last 10 months, we've evaluated its contribution to the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by means of accelerated proton beam irradiation. MATERIAL: Using UBM, we have examined 55 cases of uveal melanoma's, whose anterior border was situated at 6 mm or less from the limbus and that were consequently treated by proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The presumed tumoral origin was the ciliary body's pars plicata in 13 cases and the pars plana or the choroid in 42 cases, 17 of which presented a tumoral invasion of the pars plicata. A pars plana detachment anterior to or surrounding the anterior tumoral border, was present in 22 cases. The height of the tumor could only be measured by UBM if it was less than 2.5 mm. Information gathered using UBM have contributed to an improvement of the therapy plan in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Because of the strong attenuation of the high frequency ultrasound signal, UBM can only be used for the examination of intra-ocular structures situated in direct neighbourhood to the global wall. Despite this technical limitation, ist contribution to the planning of the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by proton beam irradiation has appeared to be considerable

The observation period was less than 2 years for 4 cases, 2 to 5 years for 10 cases, 5 to 10 years for 7 cases and more than 10 years for 3 cases. Reabsorption of retinal detachment without any recurrency was obtained for all the cases. The V.A. was increased in 16 cases, did not change in 4 cases and decreased in 4 other cases. Final V.A. was 6/7.5 or more in 9 cases (37.5%), 6/60 a 6/7.5 in 6 cases (25%), and 6/60 or less in 9 cases (37.5%). None of the cases we treated presented complications induced by radiotherapy (actinic papillitis, circulatory disturbances in the macular area, or neovascular glaucoma). The comparison of the results we obtained with cases treated by photocoagulation or external radiotherapy demonstrated a slight advantage in favour of the focalized radiotherapy, which is not statistically significant because of the small number of cases included in the studies. Meanwhile, contact radiotherapy and irradiation with an accelerated proton beam seems to be a substantial alternative for the treatment of large hemangiomas and tumors invading the macula.

METHODS: We treated 54 eyes of 53 patients with choroidal hemangioma. The lesions consisted of 48 circumscribed hemangiomas and six diffuse hemangiomas in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. The total applied dose was 27.3 Gy in four eyes, 22.7 Gy in three eyes, and 16.4 Gy to 18.2 Gy in 47 eyes. RESULTS: The retina reattached within six months after treatment in all 54 eyes and no recurrence of the secondary retinal detachment occurred within the follow-up period of 6 months to 9 years. Tumors treated with the higher doses regressed faster than tumors treated with the lower doses, but radiation-induced complications of the optic nerve appeared in all four eyes treated with a total dose of 27.3 Gy. Of 31 eyes treated with 16.4 to 18.2 Gy and followed for more than 1 year, 22 had an improvement in their visual acuity, and nine retained the same visual acuity. At the last follow-up examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in nine eyes, 20/40 to 20/25 in 13 eyes, 20/100 to 20/50 in six eyes, and 20/200 or less in three eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal hemangiomas appears to be a valid therapeutic alternative. A total proton dose ranging from 16.4 to 18.2 Gy applied in four daily fractions seems adequate to ensure local control of both tumor and secondary retinal detachment

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen cases of metastatic melanoma involving intraocular tissues, 6 cases of metastatic melanoma in the orbit, and 1 case of metastatic melanoma involving both the eye and the orbit, treated in Lausanne between 1986 and 2002, were identified from the computer files of the ocular oncology and orbitopalpebral surgery units of Jules Gonin Hospital. METHODS: The analysis is based on the demographic data concerning these patients, clinical data concerning the tumor, the treatment applied, the outcome, and the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation of intraocular and orbital metastasis, interval between primary tumor and ocular metastasis, survival of the patients, evaluation of various therapeutic protocols. RESULTS: Intraocular metastases (14 cases, 15 eyes) were situated in the choroid in 11 cases (isolated lesion, 6 cases; multiple lesions, 3 cases; diffuse involvement, 2 cases), in the iris and ciliary body in 2 cases, and in the retina and vitreous in 2 other cases. The primary tumor was a cutaneous melanoma in 8 cases, a melanoma of the contralateral eye in 3 cases, a mucosal melanoma in 1 case, and was unknown in 2 cases. The mean interval between the diagnosis of ocular metastases and the patient's death was 8.8 months (range, 1-48 months). The primary tumor in the 7 cases of orbital metastases was a cutaneous melanoma in 5 cases, a uveal melanoma in the contralateral eye in 1 case, and was unknown in 1 case. The mean interval between the diagnosis of orbital metastases and death was 19.7 months (range, 5-48 months). The patients were treated by various protocols. The best results, in terms of both local tumor control and preservation of visual function, were obtained with circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or external beam irradiation, depending on the site and extent of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic melanomas to the eye and orbit are rare and generally occur in patients with disseminated metastases during the terminal stages of the disease, with a short life expectancy. Treatment is palliative and, among the various possible treatment options, circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or global photon beam radiotherapy, at relatively high irradiation doses, seems to achieve the most favorable results

The dilemma of whether to treat by primary irradiation or by conservative surgery is not yet solved. In this study, 67 patients were treated between 1967 and 1987 for anterior commissure carcinoma of the larynx. Radiation was used with 47 patients and conservation surgery with 20 patients. Initial lesion control was achieved with 72% of the patients treated by primary irradiation. Conservation surgery, when used as a primary treatment modality, achieved local control in 90% of the patients. The new techniques of reconstruction of the larynx enhance the surgeon's ability, strengthen his conviction to proceed to enlarged partial laryngectomies, and thus improve the oncologic control of the anterior commissure carcinoma as well

Calculations of the combined coefficient of metastasizing showed the adenocarcinoma more frequently than other forms to metastasize into the lymph nodes of the chest, adrenals, and kidneys and less frequently into the liver; solid carcinoma with pseudoepidermoid metaplasia metastasizes into the brain more frequently than the other forms. The longest average survival after treatment (radical mastectomy, radiation therapy) was established in a more differentiated form of cancer - adenocarcinoma; the survival time after solid carcinoma and fibrous cancer is considerably shorter

One patient developed a fibrosarcoma of the breast stroma, 16 months after irradiation. A grade II bulky angiosarcoma was diagnosed in the breast of a patient treated 59 months previously. The third was a grade II angiosarcoma detected 41 months after therapy. At present, the risk of a second primary in the irradiated breast seems too low to justify modification of our present policy of conservative therapy of breast cancer, but a careful and longer follow-up is needed

In that survival rate radiotherapy takes part in 15%. By further development of radiological methods and techniques radiotherapy gains significance in the recent time. Optimizing radiation planning and tactics, all modern imaging techniques are applied consequently. The radiotherapist must be able to asses their immanent specifity which should remain object of the radiological training, even if separated into therapy and diagnostics. Dose distribution is calculated by computer; three-dimensional planning is done in tumors of the mediastinum, oesophagus carcinoma and paraaortic lymphomas. Critical description of radiation techniques, results, problems and prognoses are given by results in tumors of the epipharynx and gastric cancer. After-loading, done until now only in gynaecological tumors, is performed in recurrences of pharyngeal tumors by individually shaped applicators. Reducing the number of therapy failures as well as possible, the application of higher tumor doses, new kinds of rays as neutrons and combinations with physical and chemical methods is outlined. Modifications of radiation volumes are discussed, especially the irradiation of the complete abdomen in ovarian cancer, the irradiation of the complete body surface by electrons in mycosis fungoides, and the total body irradiation prior to autologue bone marrow transplantation. Modifications of fractionation are shown in short-time radiation of bone metastases and single-time radiation of brain lesions. Low penetrating electron therapy facilitates intraoperative single-time irradiation. Because of higher biological efficiency neutrons and heavy ions allow to irradiate low sensible tumors or recurrences embedded in fibrotic tissue respectively. The combination with hyperthermia yields good results in tumors of the head and neck with better local response and total remissions of 59%. There are potentials in synchronising with chemotherapeutics. Remissions of different duration were achieved in 190 patients. Because of neutrotoxicity there are still problems in applicating radiosensitizers. New methods are applied treating endocrine active tumors by labelled hormone precursers. [References: 27]

Our purpose was to demonstrate the feasibility and the possible efficacy of a single dose delivered to the macular region using a 65-MeV proton beam. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A phase II trial was set up using the cyclotron in Nice, France. Fifty-eight patients were included after signing an informed consent. All patients presented with occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularization. A single dose of 9.1 Gy (i.e., 10 Gy cobalt equivalent) was delivered to the macular region. RESULTS: The results were analyzed 3, 6, 12 and, 18 months after proton therapy. At 3 months, the visual acuity was stable or enhanced for 86% of patients, at 6 months for 82.3%, at 12 months for 80%, and at 18 months for 61%. For 22 patients at follow-up at 18 months, the reasons for a decrease in visual acuity were a macular hemorrhage for 4 patients and a progression of the neovascular membrane for 3 patients. No secondary effects related to the treatment have been observed. Regarding the lesions visible on the angiographies (i.e., hemorrhage, exudates, subretinal detachment), we observed a stabilization or a decrease in two-thirds of the cases. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results of single-dose proton therapy are at least comparable to those obtained by other teams. A second study is in progress comparing 3 dose levels, looking for a dose-effect relationship. Furthermore, a randomized study comparing a single proton dose to a placebo will be necessary to assess the long-term value of proton treatment

Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues

Tumors of different histomorphologic structure displayed unequal sensitivity to fast neutrons. Mean disease-free survival in patients with complete regression of tumor was 24 months following neutron therapy alone, 18.5 months after combined neutron-photon treatment and 5.5 months only in controls. Relapse rates were 20 and 15% in patients with pre- and postoperative neutron treatment, respectively, as compared to 52% in controls

It included irradiation of the bed of tumor removed. Fast electron beam was produced by a small betatron (collimator size--5 x 6 cm and 8 x 12 cm) installed in the operating room. Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained
