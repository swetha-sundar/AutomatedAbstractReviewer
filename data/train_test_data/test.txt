1884	Electron absorbed fractions and dose conversion factors for marrow and bone by skeletal regions	Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Bone and Bones/re [Radiation Effects], Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Bone Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Child, Child,Preschool, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Leukemia,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Male, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neutrons, Nuclear Medicine, Osteosarcoma/ep [Epidemiology], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Research, Risk Assessment	The possible inductions of bone cancer and leukemia are the two health effects of primary concern in the irradiation of the skeleton. The relevant target tissues to consider in the dosimetric evaluation have been the cells on or near endosteal surfaces of bone, from which osteosarcomas are thought to arise, and hematopoietic bone marrow, which is associated with leukemia. The complex geometry of the soft tissue-bone intermixture makes calculations of absorbed doses to these target regions a difficult problem. In the case of photon or neutron radiations, charged particle equilibrium may not exist in the vicinity of a soft tissue-bone mineral interface. In this paper, absorbed fraction data are developed for calculations of the dose in the target tissues from electron emitters deposited within the volume or on the surfaces of trabecular bone. The skeletal average absorbed fractions presented are consistent with usage of this quantity in the contemporary dosimetric formulations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Implementation of the new bone and marrow model is then developed within the context of the calculational schema of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee. Model parameters relevant to the calculation of dose conversion factors (S values) for different regions of the skeleton of individuals of various age are described, and an example calculation is performed for a monoclonal antibody which localizes in the marrow. The utility of these calculations for radiation dose calculations in nuclear medicine is discussed

A Pb(II) selective ion-exchange resin, with commercial name Pb Resin from Eichrom Technologies, Inc., was used to purify 203Pb from the cyclotron-irradiated Tl target with excellent recovery of the enriched Tl target material. The purified 203Pb was used to radiolabel the monoclonal antibody Herceptin. The in vitro and in vivo properties of the 203Pb radioimmunoconjugate were evaluated

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

In this study, AVM hemodynamics were related with clinical findings. Volume flow was calculated based on transcranial Doppler (TCD) and angiographic data. Forty patients admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital for proton beam therapy (33 +/- 10 yr old; mean +/- SD) were studied. Four symptoms were considered: intracranial bleeding, progressive neurological deficit, seizures, and headache. Fourteen control subjects aged 30 +/- 7 years (mean +/- SD) were normal volunteers. Angiography with calibrated markers permitting magnification correction was available for all patients. Lateral and medial depth limits of the intracranial basal arteries in relation to the TCD temporal window were determined by TCD and angiogram with excellent correlation. Selected depth for data acquisition was determined independently in the angiogram and by TCD. The difference between the two techniques was less than 4 mm. Mean flow velocity, pulsatility index, and vessel diameter were studied. Flow volume was calculated from these data. Mean flow velocity, pulsatility index, vessel diameter, and flow volume were significantly different among AVM feeders, non-feeders, and control arteries. The non-feeding middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery flows were 254 +/- 13, 136 +/- 14, and 79 +/- 8 ml/min, respectively. Accordingly, the estimated cerebral flow volume was 938 ml/min. The feeding middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery flows were 552 +/- 47, 369 +/- 70, and 484 +/- 67 ml/min, respectively (P < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The objective of the studies presented here was improvement of the efficacy of alpha-particle radioimmunotherapy using a chemotherapeutic agent. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a series of experiments, a treatment regimen was systematically developed in which athymic mice bearing i.p. LS-174T xenografts were injected i.p. with gemcitabine at 50 mg/kg followed by (212)Pb radioimmunotherapy. RESULTS: In a pilot study, tumor-bearing mice were treated with gemcitabine and, 24 to 30 h later, with 5 or 10 muCi (212)Pb-trastuzumab. Improvement in median survival was observed at 5 microCi (212)Pb-trastuzumab in the absence (31 days) or presence (51 days) of gemcitabine: 45 and 70 days with 10 microCi versus 16 days for untreated mice (P < 0.001). Multiple doses of gemcitabine combined with a single (212)Pb radioimmunotherapy (10 microCi) administration was then evaluated. Mice received three doses of gemcitabine: one before (212)Pb-trastuzumab and two afterwards. Median survival of mice was 63 versus 54 days for those receiving a single gemcitabine dose before radioimmunotherapy (P < 0.001), specifically attributable to (212)Pb-trastuzumab (P = 0.01). Extending these findings, one versus two treatment cycles was compared. A cycle consisted of sequential treatment with gemcitabine, 10 microCi (212)Pb radioimmunotherapy, then one or two additional gemcitabine doses. In the first cycle, three doses of gemcitabine resulted in a median survival of 90 versus 21 days for the untreated mice. The greatest benefit was noted after cycle 2 in the mice receiving 10 microCi (212)Pb-trastuzumab and two doses of gemcitabine with a median survival of 196.5 days (P = 0.005). Pretreatment of tumor-bearing mice with two doses of gemcitabine before (212)Pb radioimmunotherapy was also assessed with gemcitabine injected 72 and 24 h before (212)Pb-trastuzumab. The median survival was 56 and 76 days with one and two doses of gemcitabine versus 49 days without gemcitabine. The effect may not be wholly specific to trastuzumab because (212)Pb-HuIgG with two doses of gemcitabine resulted in a median survival of 66 days (34 days without gemcitabine). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment regimens combining chemotherapeutics with high-LET targeted therapy may have tremendous potential in the management and care of cancer patients	
3866	[Optimization of verification photographs in thoracic wall irradiations (so-called tangential field technique) in breast carcinoma. A short technical-methodical report]. [German]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Photography, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Thorax/re [Radiation Effects]	When irradiating under high voltage condition, verification photographs prove to be difficult to take if the Gantry position is not aligned to 0 degree respectively 180 degrees, since the patient is being irradiated diagonally. Under these conditions it is extremely difficult to align the X-ray-cartridge vertically to the central beam of the therapeutic radiation. This results in, amongst others, misprojections, so that definite dimensions of portrayed organ structures become practical impossible to determine. This paper presented describes how we have solved these problems on our high voltage units (tele-gamma cobalt unit and linear-accelerator). By using simple accessories, determination of dimensions of organ structures, as shown on the verification photographs, are made possible. We illustrate our method by using the so-called tangential fields technique when irradiating mamma carcinoma

203	Enhanced retention of the alpha-particle-emitting daughters of Actinium-225 by liposome carriers	Actinium/ch [Chemistry], Alpha Particles, Antibodies/im [Immunology], Cell Line,Tumor, Cryoelectron Microscopy, Humans, Liposomes/ch [Chemistry], Microscopy,Electron,Transmission, Research	Targeted alpha-particle emitters hold great promise as therapeutics for micrometastatic disease. Because of their high energy deposition and short range, tumor targeted alpha-particles can result in high cancer-cell killing with minimal normal-tissue irradiation. Actinium-225 is a potential generator for alpha-particle therapy: it decays with a 10-day half-life and generates three alpha-particle-emitting daughters. Retention of (225)Ac daughters at the target increases efficacy; escape and distribution throughout the body increases toxicity. During circulation, molecular carriers conjugated to (225)Ac cannot retain any of the daughters. We previously proposed liposomal encapsulation of (225)Ac to retain the daughters, whose retention was shown to be liposome-size dependent. However, daughter retention was lower than expected: 22% of theoretical maximum decreasing to 14%, partially due to the binding of (225)Ac to the phospholipid membrane. In this study, Multivesicular liposomes (MUVELs) composed of different phospholipids were developed to increase daughter retention. MUVELs are large liposomes with entrapped smaller lipid-vesicles containing (225)Ac. PEGylated MUVELs stably retained over time 98% of encapsulated (225)Ac. Retention of (213)Bi, the last daughter, was 31% of the theoretical maximum retention of (213)Bi for the liposome sizes studied. MUVELs were conjugated to an anti-HER2/neu antibody (immunolabeled MUVELs) and were evaluated in vitro with SKOV3-NMP2 ovarian cancer cells, exhibiting significant cellular internalization (83%). This work demonstrates that immunolabeled MUVELs might be able to deliver higher fractions of generated alpha-particles per targeted (225)Ac compared to the relative fractions of alpha-particles delivered by (225)Ac-labeled molecular carriers	
2164	Calculating photon beam characteristics with Monte Carlo techniques	Artifacts, Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Head, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Scattering,Radiation, Time, Universities	This study describes the results from a simulation of a 10 MV photon beam from a medical linac using the BEAM code. To check the quality of the generated photon beam, the characteristics of this beam (depth dose curve, cross profiles, and output factors) have been calculated and compared to measured data. By splitting up the radiation head in two parts, the target section and the collimator section calculation times were long, but acceptable when aiming at phase space files containing some 5 million particles. Given the number of particles evaluated, the accuracy of all data was around 2%. Analysis of the phase space files for different field size supports results from previous studies about contaminant particles and sources for scattered radiation for photon beams from medical linacs. The total scatter output factor Scp as well as the collimator scatter output factor Sc have been calculated within 2% of measurements. Also, the ratio between dose at a reference point for the full scatter situation and the no-scatter situation has been calculated correctly. All depth dose curves and cross profiles have also been calculated correctly, although with only moderate statistics. Improvements are possible by increasing the number of particles in the simulations (up to 50 million for the largest field size) at least 4-8 times, although calculation times will increase with the same factor. Nevertheless, the method proved itself as reliable. Still, the accuracy should be improved to 1% or better. This is necessary as we plan to use Monte Carlo simulations to benchmark three-dimensional radiotherapy planning systems. By increasing the number of particles in the phase space files and subsequently increasing the number of particles in each simulation, this 1% accuracy will be achieved. The easy way to increase the number of particles in a simulation by increasing the number of times phase space files, which were already recycled ten times, are reused from ten times (this study) to 40 times or more will not work, as it introduces artifacts, especially in the cross profiles	
1896	Accelerated fractionated proton/photon irradiation to 90 cobalt gray equivalent for glioblastoma multiforme: results of a phase II prospective trial	Actuarial Analysis, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Boston, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Contrast Media, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Gadolinium/du [Diagnostic Use], Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/pa [Pathology], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Karnofsky Performance Status, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pc [Prevention & Control], Photons, Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radiopharmaceuticals/tu [Therapeutic Use], Recurrence, Research, Supratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Rate, Time	OBJECT: After conventional doses of 55 to 65 Gy of fractionated irradiation, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) usually recurs at its original location. This institutional phase II study was designed to assess whether dose escalation to 90 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) with conformal protons and photons in accelerated fractionation would improve local tumor control and patient survival. METHODS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, Karnofsky Performance Scale score of greater than or equal to 70, residual tumor volume of less than 60 ml, and a supratentorial, unilateral tumor. Actuarial survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 34% and 18%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months, with four patients alive 22 to 60 months postdiagnosis. Analysis by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prognostic criteria or Medical Research Council indices showed a 5- to 11-month increase in median survival time over those of comparable conventionally treated patients. All patients developed new areas of gadolinium enhancement during the follow-up period. Histological examination of tissues obtained at biopsy, resection, or autopsy was conducted in 15 of 23 patients. Radiation necrosis only was demonstrated in seven patients, and their survival was significantly longer than that of patients with recurrent tumor (p = 0.01). Tumor regrowth occurred most commonly in areas that received doses of 60 to 70 CGE or less; recurrent tumor was found in only one case in the 90-CGE volume. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 90 CGE in accelerated fractionation prevented central recurrence in almost all cases. The median survival time was extended to 20 months, likely as a result of central control. Tumors will usually recur in areas immediately peripheral to this 90-CGE volume, but attempts to extend local control by enlarging the central volume are likely to be limited by difficulties with radiation necrosis	
2943	[Measurement and calculation of the air activation caused by 15 MeV continuous radiation emitted by a linear accelerator (author's transl)]. [German]	Air, Humans, Mathematics, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	The rate of air activation caused by the 15 MeV continuous radiation of a "Clinac 20" can be concluded from activation measurements in urea tablets. In case of the most unfavourable irradiation conditions, a maximum field size of 35 X 35 cm2, and a distance focus-wall of 450 cm, an air activation of 6, 18 X 10(4) Bq per individual irradiation is calculated. The limit of activity concentration prescribed by the Strahlenschutzverordnung (radioprotection directive) is not reached if a sufficient change of air is guaranteed. This method of measuring the air activation is simple, not time-consuming and can be effected with a high degree of accuracy. Measurements and calculations are compared	
806	Sliding slice: a novel approach for high accuracy and automatic 3D localization of seeds from CT scans	Algorithms, Artifacts, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional/mt [Methods], Male, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	We present a conceptually novel principle for 3D reconstruction of prostate seed implants. Unlike existing methods for implant reconstruction, the proposed algorithm uses raw CT data (sinograms) instead of reconstructed CT slices. Using raw CT data solves several inevitable problems related to the reconstruction from CT slices. First, the sinograms are not affected by reconstruction artifacts in the presence of metallic objects and seeds in the patient body. Second, the scanning axis is not undersampled as in the case of CT slices; as a matter of fact the scanning axis is the most densely sampled and each seed is typically represented by several hundred samples. Moreover, the shape of a single seed in a sinogram can be modeled exactly, thus facilitating the detection. All this allows very accurate 3D reconstruction of both position and the orientation of the seeds. Preliminary results indicate that the seed position can be estimated with 0.15 mm accuracy (average), while the orientation estimate accuracy is within 3 deg on average. Although the main contribution of the paper is to present a new principle of reconstruction, a preliminary implementation is also presented as a proof of concept. The implemented algorithm has been tested on a phantom and the obtained results are presented to validate the proposed approach	
3895	Heavy charged particle therapy of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. A phase I-II trial of the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the Northern California Oncology Group	Actuarial Analysis, Bone Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Bone Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Californium, Clinical Trials as Topic, Energy Transfer, Helium, Humans, Ions, Neon, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Palliative Care, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Sarcoma, Sarcoma/mo [Mortality], Sarcoma/pa [Pathology], Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Time, Universities	At the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the Northern California Oncology Group, a preliminary study of heavy charged particle radiotherapy in soft tissue and bone sarcoma has been carried out. Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned

The patients were classified as Stage Ib (1 patient), Stage IIa (8 patients), Stage IIb (5 patients), and Stage IVa (5 patients). Treatment resulted in a complete response in 100% (14/14) of patients with Stage Ib, IIa, and IIb disease, and a CR in 60% (3/5) of patients with Stage IVa disease. The Stage Ib and IIa patients had an overall survival of 100% and a disease-free survival of 44% at 6 years. Four of the five patients with Stage IIb CTCL relapsed within 3 months after completing TSEB + TNI with an overall survival in the group of 40% at 5 years. The Stage IVa patients all relapsed within 7 months and died of their disease within 50 months of completing treatment. The acute effects of TSEB + TNI were well tolerated, but three patients developed second malignancy (lung, kidney and skin) and one patient developed myelodysplasia, possibly the result of radiotherapy	
4184	Study of dosimetric penumbra due to multileaf collimation on a medical linear accelerator	Algorithms, Canada, Diaphragm, Film Dosimetry, Fourier Analysis, Humans, Jaw, Mathematics, Methods, Models,Structural, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Uncertainty, Water	PURPOSE: Investigations of dosimetric penumbra produced by multileaf collimation on a medical linear accelerator are presented. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Multileaf collimators (MLCs) can be designed with at least three different shaped leaf-end profiles: straight, divergent, and curved. Assessment of the dosimetric effects of the collimator edge profiles was implemented using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) convolution algorithm. Accelerator source intensity was considered to have a Gaussian distribution. The calculated dose profile, for a source-to-surface distance of 100 cm and at depth of 10 cm in a water phantom, was fitted to a penumbral-forming function from which the penumbral width between 80% and 20% of the central axis dose was obtained. RESULTS: Calculation performed at various field sizes showed that curved collimator leaf-end produces a wider penumbra than the diverging collimator leaf-side. Film measurements agreed with the calculations within an uncertainty of less than 2 mm. The effect of backup jaws for the MLC and of the lower pair of diverging diaphragms on dosimetric penumbra was also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: This study is useful for characterizing collimator edge effects and for optimizing new collimator designs	
3450	Dose delivery error detection by a computer-controlled linear accelerator	Computers, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Texas, Universities	A commercial dual photon energy, computer-controlled linear accelerator has a complex collimation and beam delivery system. For accurate dose delivery, six separate motorized elements must be properly positioned for a given beam selection. Experimentally instituted misalignments of the primary electron scattering foils, the primary collimator, the flattening filter, the scattering foil carousel, and the backscatter shield or shutter produced significant dose delivery errors. The ability of the Mylar window monitor chamber to detect these errors was examined for x-ray beams. The fault detection system failed to interrupt dose delivery in a number of situations where the error in dose per monitor unit delivered ranged from -6% to +270% of the calibrated value	
4684	Monte Carlo calculations for absolute dosimetry to determine machine outputs for proton therapy fields	Algorithms, Boston, Calibration, Head, Humans, Massachusetts, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Patients, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Reading, Research, Uncertainty	The prescribed dose in radiation therapy has to be converted into machine monitor units for patient treatment. This is done routinely for each spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) field either by calibration measurements, by using analytical algorithms or by relying on empirical data. At the Northeast Proton Therapy Center, a monitor unit corresponds to a fixed amount of charge collected in a segmented transmission ionization chamber inside the treatment head. The goal of this work was to use a detailed Monte Carlo model of the treatment head to calculate the dose delivered to the patient as a function of ionization chamber reading, i.e. to yield absolute dose in patients in terms of machine monitor units. The results show excellent agreement with measurements. For 50 SOBP fields considered in this study, the mean absolute difference between the experimental and the calculated value is 1.5%, where approximately 50% of the fields agree within 1%. This is within the uncertainties of the data. The Monte Carlo method has advantages over analytical algorithms because it takes into account scattered and secondary radiation, does not rely on empirical parameters, and provides a tool to study the influence of parts of the treatment head on the ionization chamber reading. Compared to experimental methods the Monte Carlo method has the advantage of being able to verify the dose in the patient geometry

With few exceptions, previous studies have combined results for clival and sacral chordomas, or for chordomas and other similar tumours such as chondrosarcoma, and thus it is difficult to be specific about effects of therapy. This study included histological review using immunohistochemistry to confirm diagnosis. Analysis of the survival data for our patients suggests that there are two subgroups with distinct survival patterns: one group with high mortality within the first 5 years, and a second group with an indolent disease process and near normal life expectancy. The age of the patients at presentation ranged from 7 to 78 years, with a mean of 44.3 years. Male: female distribution was 6:5. The commonest presentation was with cranial nerve palsy (94%) or with headache (60%). The most frequently involved cranial nerve was the VIth (60%), followed by the IXth and Xth (40% each). Comparing our results with those of 50 years ago, there was little improvement in the outlook for these patients, despite improvements in surgical approaches and the use of radiotherapy. The promising results in skull base tumours using proton therapy must be treated with caution until definite criteria for diagnosis and outcome have been established. There is a case for a multicentre prospective study of this disease

METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients with cervical carcinoma stages IIB-IVA who were treated with primary irradiation between the years 1985 and 1988 comprised the study group. The median survival of patients treated with 60cobalt units and linear accelerators was calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared using the log-rank test. Recurrence patterns were compared using chi-square analysis; p < .05 was considered significant for all tests. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five patients were treated with 60cobalt units (Group 1) and 53 patients were treated with a linear accelerator (Group 2). Group 1 and 2 were similar with regard to mean age and weight, stage distribution, and mean dose to point A. The rate of recurrence was comparable between Group 1 and 2 (65.6% vs. 64.2%) and no significant difference was found in overall survival between the groups (20 months vs. 21 months. p = 81).

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology	
1100	A theoretical approach to the role and critical issues associated with bystander effect in risk estimation. [Review] [22 refs]	Adaptation,Physiological, Animals, Bystander Effect, Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Death, Cell Survival, Cell Transformation,Neoplastic, Diffusion, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Motion, Radiation, Risk, Risk Assessment, Signal Transduction, Survival	This paper presents a quantitative biophysical model of the radiation-induced bystander effect. The principle aim of the bystander model is to establish whether bystander signal can be associated with low molecular weight factors that are transmitted by diffusion type processes in the medium surrounding the recipient cells. Cell inactivation and induced oncogenic transformation by microbeam and broadbeam irradiation systems were considered. The biophysical model postulates that the oncogenic bystander response observed in non-hit cells originates from specific signals received from inactivated cells. The bystander signals are assumed to be protein-like molecules spreading in the culture media by Brownian motion. The bystander signals are assumed to switch cells into a state of cell death (apoptotic/mitotic/necrosis) or induced oncogenic transformation modes. The bystander cell survival observed after treatment with the irradiated conditioned medium using broadbeam and the microbeam irradiation modalities were analysed and interpreted in the framework of the Bystander Diffusion Model (BSDM). The model predictions for cell inactivation and induced oncogenic transformation frequencies agree well with observed data from microbeam and broadbeam experiments. In the case of irradiation with constant fraction of cells, transformation frequency for the bystander effect increases with increasing radiation dose. The BSDM predicts that the bystander effect cannot be interpreted solely as a low-dose effect phenomenon. It is shown that the bystander component of radiation response can increase with dose and can be observed at high doses as well as low doses. The validity of this conclusion is supported by analysis of experimental results from high-LET microbeam experiments. [References: 22]

In addition to using conventional X rays (250 kV) as a reference standard, multilayers were tested for their suitability in cell survival studies with heavy-ion irradiation ((12)C(6+)) in the plateau and the extended Bragg peak with a scanned ion beam. Multilayers of both cell lines showed decreased survival compared to the corresponding monolayers after both X and heavy-ion irradiation. This multicellular sensitization effect is in contrast to the multicellular resistance or contact effect commonly described in the literature. Flow cytometry measurements showed an arrest of irradiated SiHa cells in G(2)/M phase. In contrast to the transient arrest of the monolayers, the multilayers stayed in a prolonged arrest. After Bragg-peak irradiation of monolayers, the arrest time was increased by 12-24 h, and more cells were arrested than with X rays. For multilayers, there were no differences between G(2) arrest after X rays and heavy ions for the entire observation period

3421	Cumulative genetic damage in hematopoietic stem cells in a patient with a 40-year exposure to alpha particles emitted by thorium dioxide	Alpha Particles, Angiography, Bone Marrow, Cells,Cultured, Cerebral Angiography, Chromosome Aberrations, Chromosome Painting, Contrast Media, Glycophorin/ge [Genetics], Hematopoietic Stem Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Hematopoietic Stem Cells/ul [Ultrastructure], Humans, Interphase, Liver, Lymphocytes, Metaphase, Methods, Micronuclei,Chromosome-Defective, Mutation, Radiation, Research, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects]	Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of the long-lived radionuclide, thorium-232, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for several decades. Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the "stable" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness

Stereotactic heavy-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery, using narrow beams of heavy ions (helium), demonstrates superior biological and physical characteristics in brain over X and gamma rays and protons, viz., improved dose distribution in the Bragg peak, sharp lateral and distal borders, and less multiple scattering and range straggling for the same residual range in CNS tissue. Examination of CNS tissue response and alteration of cerebral blood-flow dynamics related to heavy-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery is being undertaken using three-dimensional treatment planning and quantitative imaging utilizing cerebral angiography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cine-CT, xenon X-ray CT, and positron emission tomography (PET). Also under examination are the physical properties of narrow heavy-ion beams for improving methods of dose delivery and dose distribution and for establishing clinical RBE/LET and dose-response relationships for human CNS tissues. Based on the evaluation and treatment with stereotactically directed narrow beams of heavy ions of over 130 patients, with cerebral angiography and CT scanning, and with MRI and radioisotope scanning of selected patients, plus extensive clinical and neuroradiological follow-up, it appears that heavy-ion radiosurgery obliterates intracranial arteriovenous malformations or protects against rebleeding with reduced morbidity and mortality	
1447	Correlation of red marrow radiation dosimetry with myelotoxicity: empirical factors influencing the radiation-induced myelotoxicity of radiolabeled antibodies, fragments and peptides in pre-clinical and clinical settings	Animals, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Colorectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Electrons, Female, Germany, Humans, Immunoconjugates, Linear Energy Transfer, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Mice, Mice,Nude, Radiation, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time	Usually, the red marrow (RM) is the first dose-limiting organ in systemic radionuclide therapy, e.g., radioimmuno-or radiopeptide therapy. However, several studies have obtained rather poor correlations between the marrow doses and the resulting toxicities. Red marrow doses are mostly not determined directly, but are derived from blood or whole-body doses. The aim of our recent work was to analyze, in a nude mouse model in more detail, additional factors than just total dose, such as dose rate or relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factors, that may influence the resulting myelotoxicity. Furthermore, we wanted to analyze, whether correlations between the red marrow doses and the resulting myelotoxicities can be found in clinical metabolic endo-radiotherapy. The maximum tolerated activities (MTAs) and doses (MTDs) of several murine, chimeric and humanized immunoconjugates as complete IgG or fragments (F(ab)(2), Fab), as well as peptides, labeled with beta(-)- (such as (131)I or (90)Y), Auger electron- (such as (125)I or (111)In), or alpha-emitters (such as (213)Bi) were determined in nude mice. Blood counts were monitored at weekly intervals; bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in order to support the assumption of the RM as dose-limiting. The radiation dosimetry was derived from biodistribution data of the various conjugates, accounting for cross-organ radiation; the activities in the blood, bone, bone marrow, and major organs were determined over time. Dosimetry and myelotoxicity data of three clinical radioimmunotherapy trials, involving a total of 82 colorectal cancer patients, treated with (131)I-labeled anti-CEA IgG, and twelve non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, treated with (131)I-labeled anti-CD20 IgG, were analyzed. In the preclinical model, at the respective MTAs, the RM doses differed significantly between the three conjugates: e.g., with (131)I-labeled conjugates, the maximum tolerated activities were#10; 260 microCi for IgG, 1200 microCi for F(ab)(2), and 3 mCi for Fab, corresponding to blood doses of 17 Gy, 9 Gy, and 4 Gy, respectively. However, initial dose rates were 10 times higher with Fab as compared to IgG, and still 3 times higher as compared to F(ab)(2); interestingly, all 3 deliver approximately 4 Gy within the first 24 h. The MTDs of all three conjugates were increased by BMT by approximately 30%. Similar observations were made for the (90)Y-labeled conjugates. Higher blood-based RM doses were tolerated with Auger-emitters than with conventional beta(-)-emitters, whereas the MTDs were similar between alpha- and beta(-)-emitters. In accordance to dose rates never exceeding those occurring at the single injection MTA, re-injections of (131)I-, (90)Y-, or (213)Bi-labeled Fab' were tolerated without increased lethality, if administered 24-48 h apart, whereas reinjection of bivalent conjugates was not possible. Clinically, a sigmoidally shaped dose-effect correlation was found in colorectal cancer patients treated with (131)I-anti-CEA IgG. Previous mitomycin chemotherapy was identified as additional myelosensitizing factor leading to enhanced myelotoxicity. At comparable doses, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients developed higher degrees of myelotoxicity with a less clearly pronounced predictability from red marrow doses. In summary, results in the murine model suggest a strong influence of the dose rate (or better: dose per unit time), not only total dose on the resulting myelotoxicity, whereas the influence of high- (alpha, Auger/conversion electrons) versus low-LET (beta,gamma) type radiation seems to be much lower than expected from previous in vitro data. The lower myelotoxicity of Auger e(-) emitters is probably due to the short path length of their low-energy electrons, which cannot reach the nuclear DNA if the antibody is not internalized into the stem cells of the red marrow. Clinically, additional factors than just marrow dose (e.g., previous myelotoxic therapy, bone marrow involvement by metastatic malignancy) seem to a, bone marrow involvement by metastatic malignancy) seem to affect the resulting myelotoxicity

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

Under the auspices of University Claude Bemard Lyon-I and with the support of a research contract between Rhone-Alpes region and the Minister of Research, a design has been elaborated. This paper reviews the medical and technical characteristics of the project, called ETOILE (Espace de Traitement Oncologique par Ions Legers dans le cadre Europeen). The research programs associated with ETOILE concern mainly the tracking of moving organs, the design of an in-beam PET detector, the simulation of the interaction of carbon ions with tissues and radiobiological studies on the radiosensitivity and tolerance of normal tissues and on the radioresistance of tumours. The capital cost needed to realize ETOILE is about 90 M Euro. We expect a definitive decision to build ETOILE at the end of 2004. In that case the centre will treat its first patients in 2009. A routine flux of 1000 patients per year will be reached after 3 years with an operation cost of 15 M Euro	
3908	The three dose components of negative pion beam and their role in pion radiotherapy	Alpha Particles, Electrons, Energy Transfer, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Silicon, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	A new method has been developed for analyzing therapeutic negative pion beams into three LET (linear energy transfer) dose components inherent in such a beam. The technique utilizes thin silicon detectors to obtain pulse height spectra produced by the various particles in the beam traversing the detectors. It is shown that a low LET group is correlated with the incoming pions, muons and electrons; a medium LET group corresponds to protons, deuterons, tritons, and high energy alpha particles; and a high LET group is due to low energy alpha particles, 3He and recoil particles. Several beams used clinically have been studied

These are: 1) antineoplastic chemotherapy 2) radiosensitizing agents 3) high LET radiotherapy 4)local hyperthermia Preoperative chemotherapy, followed by surgery and irradiation, has improved the local control as well as survival rates in phase II trials. Cis-platinum may yield some additional benefit due to its radiosensitizing properties. Radiosensitizing drugs such as nitro-imidazoles have so far failed to show any advantage in randomized trials, since neurotoxicity prevented maximum effective concentrations. The same is true for high LET radiotherapy with neutrons as compared to conventional irradiation. Local hyperthermia is considered as a palliation at the present time, when all other treatment modalities have been exhausted. In our centre, the preliminary results of radiotherapy and sensitization with cis-platinum in combination with surgery are encouraging. Some methods are discussed which permit the prediction of prognostic criteria for tumors under treatment. This may contribute to the optimization of individual treatment regimes in the future

In order to improve the physical database, the fragmentation characteristics along the penetration path in tissue were investigated experimentally by using a water phantom as tissue-equivalent absorber. Measurements were performed at specific energies of 200 and 400 MeV u(-1) of the incident (12)C ions and at six different depths before and behind the Bragg peak. Secondary fragments with nuclear charges Z(f) = 1-5 were identified by scintillation detectors using DeltaE-E and time-of-flight techniques. The preliminary results include energy- and angular distributions, fragment yields, build-up curves and attenuation of the primary carbon projectiles

4508	Boron neutron capture therapy for the treatment of cerebral gliomas. I. Theoretical evaluation of the efficacy of various neutron beams	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Californium, Gamma Rays, Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Mathematics, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research	The technique of boron neutron capture therapy in the treatment of cerebral gliomas depends upon the selective loading of the tumor with a 10B-enriched compound and subsequent irradiation of the brain with low-energy neutrons. The charged particles produced in the 10B (n,alpha) 7Li reaction have ranges in tissue of less than 10 mum so that the dose distribution closely follows the 10B distribution even to the cellular level. The effectiveness of this therapy procedure is dependent not only on the 10B compound but on the spectral characteristics of the neutron source as well. Hence, an optimization of these characteristics will increase the chances of therapeutic success. Transport calculations using a neutral particle transport code have been made to determine the dose-depth distributions within a simple head phantom for five different incident neutron beams. Comparison of these beams to determine their relative therapeutic efficacy was made by the use of a maximum useable depth criterion. In particular, with presently available compounds, the MIT reactor (MITR) therapy beam (a) is not inferior to a pure thermal neutron beam, (b) would be marginally improved if its gamma-ray contamination were eliminated, (c) is superior to a partially 10B-filtered MITR beam, and (d) produces a maximum useable depth which is strongly dependent upon the tumor-to-blood ratio of 10B concentrations and weakly dependent upon the absolute 10B concentration in tumor. A pure epithermal neutron beam with a mean energy of 37 eV is shown to have close to the optimal characteristics for boron neutron capture therapy. Futhermore, these optimal characteristics can be approximated by a judiciously D2O moderated and 10B-filtered 252Cf neutron source. This tailored 252Cf source would have at least a 1.5 cm greater maximum useable depth than the MITR therapy beam for realistic 10B concentrations. However, at least one gram of 252Cf would be needed to make this a practical therapy source. If the moderated 252Cf source is not 10B filtered, the resultant neutron beam has characteristics similar to those of the MITR beam with no gamma-ray contamination. For usch a beam, 100 mg of 252Cf would produce a flux of 2.4 X 10(8) neutrons/(cm2 sec), which is an intensity suitable for therapy applications

A description of the facility and details of the accident are reported in Schauer et al., 1993a). In brief, during maintenance on the lower window pressure plate of a 3 MV potential drop accelerator, an operator placed his hands, head, and feet in the radiation beam. The filament voltage of the electron source was turned 'off', but the full accelerating potential was on the high voltage terminal. The operator's body, especially his extremities and head, were exposed to electron dark current. At approx. 3 months post-irradiation, the four digits of the victim's right hand and most of the four digits of his left hand were amputated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry was used to estimate the radiation dose to the victim's extremities. Extremity dose estimates ranged from 55.0 Gy (+/- 4.7 Gy) to 108 Gy (+/- 24.1 Gy)

Main distinctions between the dose distribution of megavolt gamma radiation and that of proton radiation are due to that the latter is totally absent behind the target and energy gradients along the lateral and back site boundaries of the proton irradiation field are high. Data on the operating proton therapy centers and those being designed are presented. The unjustifiably slow rate of integration of the proton technique with clinical practice is due to the time-consuming nature of relevant research. Possible ways and means of obviating the difficulties involved are discussed

A Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic system and a 6 MV linear accelerator have been modified for these treatments. By using multiple isocentric rotational fields, radiation doses from 1500 to 2500 cGy can be safely prescribed to the AVM in efforts to occlude the blood vessels without risking damage to nearby radiosensitive structures.

180	Liquid ionization chamber measurements of dose distributions in small 6 MV photon beams	Air, Biophysics, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	A new liquid ionization chamber (LIC) design optimized for high spatial resolution was used for measurements of dose distributions in radiation fields intended for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This work was mainly focused on the properties of this detector in radiation fields from linear accelerators for clinical radiotherapy (pulsed radiation with dose rates from approximately 0.5 to 5 Gy min-1 and beam diameters down to 8 mm). The narrow beams used in stereotactic radiosurgery require detectors with small sizes in order to provide a good spatial resolution. The LIC is investigated to see whether it can be used as a detector for dose measurements in beams currently used for stereotactic radiosurgery. Its properties are compared with those of silicon diodes. The comparisons include output factor (OF), depth dose and profile measurements in 6 MV photon fields of different sizes. For OF measurements, an NACP air ionization chamber was also used in the comparison. The dependence of the response on the detector orientation in the photon beam is also investigated for the diodes and the LIC. The results suggest that LICs can provide better properties than diodes for measuring dose distributions in narrow photon beams

1723	Modeling the output ratio in air for megavoltage photon beams	Air, Biophysics, Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Pennsylvania, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Uncertainty, Universities	The output ratio in air, OR, for a high-energy x-ray beam describes how the incident central axis photon fluence varies with collimator setting. For field sizes larger than 3 x 3 cm2, its variation is caused by the scatter of photons in structures in the accelerator head (primarily the flattening filter and the wedge, if one is used) and by the backscatter of radiation into the monitor ionization chamber. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an analytical function to parametrize OR for square collimator setting c: OR = (1 + a1.c).[1 + a2.erf(c/lambda)2].H0. For open beams, these parameters can be attributed to explicit physical meanings within the systematical uncertainty of the model: a1 accounts for backscatter into the monitor, a2 is the maximum scatter-to-primary ratio for head-scattered photons, and lambda represents the effective width of the "source" of head-scatter photons. H0 is a constant that sets OR = 1 for c = 10 cm. This formula also fits OR for wedge beams and a Co-60 unit, although the fitting parameters lose their physical interpretations. To calculate the output ratio for a rectangular field, cx x cy, an equivalent square can be used: c = (1 + k).cy x cx/(k.cx + cy), where k is a constant. The study included a number of different accelerators and a cobalt-60 unit. The fits for square fields agreed with measurements with a standard deviation (SD) of less than 0.5%. Using k = lx.(f - ly)/ly.(f - lx), where lx and ly are the source-to-collimator distances and f is the source-to-detector distance, measurements and calculations agreed within a SD of 0.7% for rectangular fields. Sufficient data for the three parameters are presented to suggest constraints that can be used for quality assurance of the measured output ratio in air

Three regimens of fractionation were used: (1) accelerated fractionation (AF)--(133), 2.5 Gy, 3 days a week, to a total of 47.5--55 Gy; (2) accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF)--(93), 1.25 Gy, daily, to a total of 60-72.5 Gy and standard fractionation (SF)--(149), 2 Gy, daily, to a total of 58-68 Gy. The advantages of AHF were established as regards complete regression rate (54.9% vs. 18.6%--SF and 18.1%--AF; p(0.001), median survival (30.5(2.4 months vs. 18.9 (1%--SF (p = 0.004) and 20.4 (2.4--AF (p = 0.004)), and 3-year survival (36.6% vs. 16.7%--SF (p = 0.005) and 15.5%--AF (p = 0.005). 17.9%, 9.0% (p = 0.11) and 8.1% (p = 0.08) have survived, respectively. Overall survival in the AHF group was superior in stages IIB--III; in stage I, the results were identical. Immediate response to radical radiotherapy appeared the only statistically significant factor of survival (p = 0.005-0.008) in all the groups

PBT has a half-century history, and more than 35,000 patients have been reported as having had treatments with proton beams worldwide. The historic change to this therapy occurred in the 1990s, when the Loma Linda University Medical Center began clinical activity as the first hospital in the world to utilize a medically dedicated proton therapy facility. Since then, similar hospital-based medically dedicated facilities have been constructed. Results from around the world have shown the therapeutic superiority of PBT over alternative treatment options for ocular melanoma, skull base sarcoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer. PBT is expected to achieve further advancement both clinically and technologically. [References: 15]	
4179	Potential for improvement in radiation therapy	Boston, Breast, Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Massachusetts, Methods, Morbidity, Motion, Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Uncertainty	A successful strategy for improving the efficacy of radiation therapy has been to improve dose distribution, that is, reduce treatment volume toward target volume. This is so as the smaller treatment volume has permitted a higher dose to the target (hence a high tumor control probability) and a lesser volume of non-target tissues being irradiated (consequently a reduced frequency and severity of treatment related morbidity). There are in place several important means for further improvements in dose distributions. These include: (a) 3D graphic reconstruction of the affected part with definition of the position of the tumor vis-a-vis the adjacent normal structures; (b) explicit inclusion in the treatment plan of the uncertainty band around each isodose contour; (c) on-line contrast enhanced visual monitoring of the target tissue during the individual treatment session; (d) gating of treatment so as to reduce the impact of patient motion on the needed treatment volume; (e) use of computer control systems to execute the treatment; and (f) use of treatment methods which achieve a reduced treatment volume. In an examination for sites for which treatment volumes might be decreased by a substantial factor we have compared treatment volumes for radical surgical and radiation therapy. Results are presented for carcinomas of the cervix (Stage IB), breast (Stage II), floor of mouth (Stage II). We describe a system developed here for on-line visual monitoring of the tissues covered by the treatment field. Brief descriptions are given of results of low LET charged particle radiation therapy and of intraoperative electron beam therapy. Also, the program developed here to use computer graphic techniques to display tumor and normal structures and isodose countours with uncertainty bands around each contour is mentioned

We have treated such patients with stereotactic Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy and report the follow-up of 74 of the first 75, 2 to 16 years after treatment. Proton-beam therapy is intended to induce subendothelial deposition of collagen and hyaline substance, which narrows the lumens of small vessels and thickens the walls of the malformation during the first 12 to 24 months after the procedure. Two deaths from hemorrhage occurred in the first 12 months after treatment, but no lethal or disabling hemorrhages occurred after this interval. Seizures, headaches, and progressive neurologic deficits were in most cases arrested or improved. Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy appears to be a useful technique for treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations, especially those that are unsuitable for treatment by other methods

Brain tumors of this type were not induced by protons of other energies (32-2,300 MeV). Induction of HGA has been identified in human patients who have had radiation therapy to the head. We believe that the induction of HGA in the monkey is a consequence of dose distribution, not some unique "toxic" property of protons. Comparison of the human experience with the monkey data indicates the RBE for induction of brain tumors to be about one. It is unlikely that protons cause an unusual change in oncogenic expression, as compared to conventional electromagnetic radiation

This paper discusses an approach suggested by the Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) for both prescribing the total body irradiation (TBI) dose and calculating the beam-on time or meter set needed to deliver it. It is aimed at guaranteeing the accuracy of the calculations, while at the same time ensuring a high degree of compliance for the various CCSG protocols using TBI.

A monitoring system is described consisting of a fluorescent screen, video camera, and computer interface. Approximately ten frames are analyzed each second, verifying the beam intensity, uniformity, position, and diameter. When mounted on the gantry, the system can indicate the dynamic isocenter position using the "ball test" technique. The fluorescent screen video indicates that the 6-MV beam used for radiosurgery at our facility is acceptably stable; moreover, the small isocenter shift versus gantry and couch angles is reasonably reproducible. At our facility, quality assurance tests with this apparatus are performed every month

A progressive reduction in glandular volume (of low, medium, and high grade) was observed in 48/50 patients respectively within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and 6-9 months after treatment. After 9 months only lesser modifications were observed. A statistically significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between volume decrease percentage and histologic grading of the tumor, but not with its stage. Within the groups of patients affected with similar-grade neoplasms, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) was observed, relative to the decrease rate of prostatic volume, between the patients with complete response and those with partial or no response. US monitoring of prostatic volume after radiotherapy, if correlated with histologic grading, can yield early predictive elements as to treatment outcome, thus contributing to select non-responsive patients to submit to biopsy and, if necessary, to therapeutic alternatives or combinations. Longer-term studies are needed to prove its effectiveness, to prognostic purposes, in the single patient

Nevertheless, this treatment is today only possible with large scale accelerator facilities which are very difficult to install at existing hospitals. In this article we report on a new approach for proton acceleration up to energies within the therapeutic window between 60 and 200 MeV by using modern, high intensity and compact laser systems. By focusing such laser beams onto thin foils we obtained on target intensities of 6 x 10(19) W/cm2, which is sufficient to produce a well-collimated proton beam with an energy of up to 10 MeV. These results are in agreement with numerical simulations and indicate that proton energies within the therapeutic window should be obtained in the very near future using such economical and very compact laser systems. Hence, this approach could revolutionize cancer treatment by bringing the "lab to the hospital-rather than the hospital to the lab"

The disease-free survival rate at five years is 62.6% for T1-, 71.5% for T2- and 28.7% for T3-tumours (p = 0.016). Significant differences were also found for various grades, i.e. 73.3% for G1-, 47.7% for G2- (p = 0.035) and 22.4% for G3-tumours (p = 0.024). Patients without microscopic tumour residue fared best with a survival rate of 86.6%, followed by patients with microscopic tumour (65.5%; p = 0.042) and patients with gross tumour (25.5%; p = 0.003) left behind. A functional limb was preserved in 86% of the patients with extremity lesions. The local control rate of patients with gross tumour was 76.5% compared with 53% in previous photon series. This finding underlines the potential biological advantage of neutrons in these tumours. Serious side effects ranged from 28% in the patients treated with neutrons for large volumes to 7% in patients treated with a neutron boost

Existing exposure rate measurements are utilized as well as a newly developed effective modulation scaling factor. Examples are given for vaults housing 6, 10 and 18 MV linear accelerators. The use of an 18 MV Siemens linear accelerator is evaluated for IMRT delivery with respect to neutron production and the effects on individual patients. A modified modulation scaling factor is developed and the risk of the incurrence of fatal secondary malignancies is estimated. The difference in neutron production between 18 MV Varian and Siemens accelerators is estimated using Monte Carlo results. The neutron production from the Siemens accelerator is found to be approximately 4 times less than that of the Varian accelerator resulting in a risk of fatal secondary malignancy occurrence of approximately 1.6% when using the SMLC delivery technique and our measured modulation scaling factors. This compares with a previously published value of 1.6% for routine 3D CRT delivery on the Varian accelerator. (c) 2003 American College of Medical Physics

The treatable protocol depth (TPD) was utilized as an evaluation index. MCNP calculations were performed for near-threshold 7Li(p,n)7Be at a proton energy of 1.900 MeV and for a polyethylene BDE. The effect of dose protocol on BDE characteristics was reflected in terms of the optimum BDE thickness needed for maximum TPD which was found to be independent of the treatable dose but was observed to vary for different combinations of the tolerance doses for heavy charged particles and gamma rays. For the 10B concentration dependence, the TPD was increased by increasing the T/N ratio, i.e., the ratio of the 10B concentration in the tumour (10B(Tumour)) to that in the normal tissue (10B(Normal)), and by increasing 10B(Tumour) and 10B(Normal) at constant T/N ratio. It was found that the use of BDE becomes unnecessary from the viewpoint of increasing the TPD, when 10B(Tumour) is over a certain level which is decided by the conditions of the dose protocol	
4213	Head-scatter factors in rectangular photon fields	Biophysics, Humans, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Scattering,Radiation, Universities	Head-scatter factors were measured for a range of field sizes of rectangular shape from a linear accelerator that provides 6 and 25 MV photon beams. For a given field length and width, exchange of the inner and outer collimator pairs produces differences in the head-scatter factor of up to about 2% and 3% in open and wedged fields, respectively. Dependence on elongation deviates by up to 2% from that given by the equivalent squares. Such effects can easily be taken into account by using head-scatter data that have been directly measured in rectangular fields or by applying empirical corrections to values for square or equivalent square fields

Patients are treated in a standing position using dual angled fields at a source to skin distance of 3.6 m. Dosimetric characteristics of the dual field technique were investigated for the 6-MeV beam as well as for a lower energy beam produced by the introduction of an acrylic beam degrader. A treatment stand, which incorporates the degrader in addition to devices used for patient support and shielding, is described. Acceptable beam uniformity and depth dose have been achieved while maintaining a low level of x-ray contamination. Treatment times are reasonably short since the output of the machine in the high-dose-rate mode is 25 Gy/min at the isocenter. Beam uniformity, dose rate, and x-ray contamination are relatively unaffected by the presence of the beam degrader if it is positioned near the treatment plane. The high dose-rate electron option is a useful treatment mode that provides the advantage of reduced treatment times while retaining proper functioning of all accelerator dosimetry systems and interlocks. Use of a dual field technique permits TSET in a treatment room of standard dimensions. The machine is easily set up for treatment, and patient setup is simplified through use of a customized support system

Studies have shown that the scatter radiation to the contralateral breast may play a large part in the induction of secondary breast cancers. Factors that may contribute to the contralateral breast dose may include the use of blocks, the orientation of the field, and wedges. Reports have shown that the use of regular wedges, particularly for the medial tangential field, gives a significantly higher dose to the contralateral breast compared to an open field. This paper compares the peripheral dose outside the field using a regular wedge, a dynamic wedge, and an open field technique. The data collected consisted of measurements taken with patients, solid water and a Rando phantom using a Varian 2300CD linear accelerator. Ion chambers, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), diodes, and films were the primary means for collecting the data. The measurements show that the peripheral dose outside the field using a dynamic wedge is close to that of open fields, and significantly lower than that of regular wedges. This information indicates that when using a medial wedge, a dynamic wedge should be used

The treatment of these tumors at Curie Institute has been done with cobalt plaques since 1968. Indications were first monophthalmic patients but are now much wide. We have been treating since 1981 all patients with tumor diameter less than 17 mm and tumor height less than 12 mm. The technic includes general anesthesia to place the disc with localisation of the tumor by transillumination or by indirect ophthalmoscopy. A dose of 70 to 90 grays is delivered to the apex of the tumor. We report two cases of patients treated by cobalt 60 plaque for choroidal melanoma. The first patient has a 5 mm high choroidal melanoma temporal to the macula. After treatment by cobalt plaque, he showed no echographic changes but angiograms revealed an hypofluorescent zone in the central part of the tumor. The second patient has an 8 mm tumor that after plaque showed only angiographic changes. Evolution after treatment of choroidal melanoma by radioactive plaque is variable. Echographic changes are very low and it is frequent to observe no modification in the height of the tumor for a long time for this reason, repeated angiograms can be very useful in the follow up of these patients. They frequently show hypofluorescent spot in the central part of a tumor that was hyperfluorescent before treatment. Sometimes there is diffuse lowering of the fluorescence. We think that these modifications of fluorescence can be due to diminution of the vascularisation of the tumor or may be to central necrosis of the tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients	
2335	A simple method of obtaining off-axis half-value layers for megavoltage photon beams	Humans, Mathematics, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Water	We describe a simplified technique for the acquisition of off-axis beam-quality data (i.e., half-value layers in water) for medical linear accelerators. A measurement protocol is presented in which an ordinary beam-scanning water phantom is used to accurately position an ionization chamber at appropriate measuring positions. Attenuation coefficients are calculated by performing a regression on the measured data. The technique uses the smallest fields for which lateral electron equilibrium can be established

Sedimentation of complexes containing DNA was studied after cell lysis by centrifugation in a neutral sucrose gradient. The distinctions noted after irradiation with gamma-rays and heavy ions are consistent with the idea of the superhelical organization of DNA into discrete and membrane-bound compact units. According to the estimates made the diameter of these complexes was approximately 0.2 micron and DNA content, about 2 X 10(9) dalton	
2534	Uveal melanoma radiation. 125I brachytherapy versus helium ion irradiation	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], California, Californium, Eye, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/ae [Adverse Effects], Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Ions, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research, Retrospective Studies, Survival Analysis, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The optimum radiation therapy for uveal melanoma is uncertain. Both helium ion irradiation and 125I brachytherapy have been used to treat this neoplasm. This investigation analyzed the control and complication rates of uveal melanomas treated with helium ions of 125I plaques. In both a retrospective and a prospective dynamically balanced study, the control rates appeared to be similar. There were more posterior segment complications after 125I plaques and more anterior segment complications, including neovascular glaucoma, after helium ion irradiation. The follow-up period is too short to draw definitive conclusions on the radiation complications. Overall, approximately 89% of eyes were retained and less than 4% of treated eyes were removed because of failure to control the tumor	
2077	Verification of absolute dose rates for intravascular brachytherapy beta sources	Belgium, Blood Vessels/re [Radiation Effects], Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/is [Instrumentation], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Calibration, Film Dosimetry, Humans, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Strontium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Temperature, Water, Yttrium Radioisotopes, Yttrium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use]	The absolute dose rate around beta sources for intravascular brachytherapy was measured with thin thermoluminescent (TL) dosimeters and radiochromic film. The calibration of these dosimeters was performed at the dose maximum in a 6 MeV electron beam of a linear accelerator. Compared to the values given by the manufacturers, higher dose rates of about 20% for 90Sr/90Y source trains and 20 to 40% for 90Y line sources were found. We also measured the dose rate for a planar 90Sr/90Y source, which was calibrated at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This source serves as a reference for the determination of the dose rates by the supplier of the 90Y sources. For this source we measured a 13% higher dose rate compared to the value given in the calibration report by NIST. Our observation can have important consequences for the interpretation and comparison of the dose-related clinical results of intravascular brachytherapy with these and other beta sources. Also the comparison of the clinical results obtained with beta sources and gamma sources, i.e. 192Ir, depends largely on the accuracy of the absolute dosimetry of the beta sources	
3811	Dose distributions in dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery	Brain Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Canada, Family, Humans, Immobilization, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation, Software, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities	A treatment planning technique for calculation of dose distributions in dynamic stereotactic "radiosurgery" with a 10-MV isocentrically mounted linear accelerator is presented. The treatment planning for dynamic radiosurgery is a three-dimensional problem, since during treatment both the gantry and the couch rotate simultaneously, the gantry from 30 degrees to 330 degrees and the couch from 75 degrees to - 75 degrees. The patient surface and anatomical information is obtained from a family of computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans, and a stereotactic frame is used for target localization, treatment setup, and patient immobilization during the treatment. The dose calculational algorithm follows the gantry and couch rotation in an incremental fashion, and relies on measured stationary beam central axis percentage depth doses and dose profiles to calculate the normalized tissue-maximum-ratio distributions over a matrix of points defined on one of three orthogonal planes (transverse, sagittal, or coronal). The dose calculation algorithm is discussed in detail and calculated dose distributions for single plane and dynamic radiosurgery compared with measured data

1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement	
3997	Evaluation of radiosurgery techniques with cumulative dose volume histograms in linac-based stereotactic external beam irradiation	Brain Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Californium, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities, X-Rays	Radiosurgery at UCSF is performed with a 6-MV linear accelerator with tertiary collimation for improved small field definition. The dose delivery to the target relative to normal tissue is influenced by the number of arcs, the arc geometry, field size, and beam energy. The impact of arc number, arc geometry, and field size on the dose distribution from 6-MV X rays in a 16 cm spherical phantom has been evaluated through the use of cumulative dose volume histograms. Dose volume histograms were calculated for a) 1-5 and 10 arcs, and b) collimator sizes of 1.25, 2.0, and 3.0 cm. Differences between techniques were found at the 5-10% level for field sizes from 1.25 to 2.0 cm. It was shown that the finite dimension of the sphere and, by extension, head diminishes the differences between techniques for the larger field sizes. The effect of treating with two isocenters is also analyzed and an approach for improving the dose distribution is presented	
2007	Monte Carlo modelling of electron beams from medical accelerators. [Review] [138 refs]	Electrons, Head, Humans, Knowledge, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Universities	Monte Carlo simulation of radiation transport is considered to be one of the most accurate methods of radiation therapy dose calculation. With the rapid development of computer technology, Monte Carlo based treatment planning for radiation therapy is becoming practical. A basic requirement for Monte Carlo treatment planning is a detailed knowledge of the radiation beams from medical accelerators. A practical approach to obtain the above is to perform Monte Carlo simulation of radiation transport in the medical accelerator. Additionally, Monte Carlo modelling of the treatment machine head can also improve our understanding of clinical beam characteristics, help accelerator design and improve the accuracy of clinical dosimetry by providing more realistic beam data. This paper summarizes work over the past two decades on Monte Carlo simulation of clinical electron beams from medical accelerators. [References: 138]	
3812	Dose distributions in radiosurgery	Canada, Humans, Microcomputers, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation, Universities	A PC-based, three-dimensional treatment planning system, which may be used for planning of radiosurgical treatments with the Gamma unit or with any of the radiosurgical techniques based on isocentric linear accelerators (linacs), is described and used to calculate isodose distributions for various linac-based radiosurgical techniques ranging from the single plane rotation to a 4-pi geometry. The latter gives an isotropic dose falloff outside the target volume but cannot be used for practical radiosurgery, while the single plane rotation is simple to use but gives unacceptably shallow dose falloffs in the transverse plane. Dose falloffs for several other techniques of varying degrees of complexity are shown and discussed. Also discussed is the effect of beam energy and beam profiles on radiosurgical dose distributions

METHODS: From 1970 to 2001, 40 patients with primary tracheal carcinoma treated in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight were male and 12 were female with median age of 47 years. The median interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 10 months (1 - 60 months). Fifteen patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma, 14 squamous cell carcinoma, 8 adenocarcinoma, 2 small-cell carcinoma and 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Thirty-two patients received operation plus adjuvant radiotherapy, 6 received radiotherapy alone and 2 received operation alone. RESULTS: The median survival time for all patients was 40 months. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate was 86%, 59% and 29%, respectively. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year local control rate was 84%, 60% and 50%, respectively. Distant metastasis rate in 1, 5, and 10 years was 17%, 51% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy is a reasonable mode of treatment. Despite late local recurrence after initial treatment, its intrinsic feature, excellent long-term palliation can be achieved after treatment	
179	Monte Carlo study of fluence perturbation effects on cavity dose response in clinical proton beams.[see comment]	Air, Biophysics, Electrons, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Water	Current protocols for clinical proton beam dosimetry have not implemented any chamber-dependent correction factors for absorbed dose determination. The present work initiates a Monte Carlo study of these factors with emphasis on proton fluence perturbation effects and preliminary calculations of perturbation effects from secondary electrons. The proton Monte Carlo code PTRAN was modified to allow simulation of proton transport in non-homogeneous geometries of both unmodulated and modulated beams. The dose to water derived from the dose calculated in an air cavity agrees well with results from analytical calculations assuming a displacement of the point of measurement. For unmodulated beams small differences, limited to 0.8%, could be partially attributed to proton multiple scattering. Effects of replacing water around the cavity with wall material are explained by the introduction of a water-equivalent wall thickness. For modulated beams no significant perturbation effects arise. Secondary electron spectra are calculated analytically. Preliminary electron transport calculations with EGS4 show that wall perturbations of the order of 1% could result. Perturbation effects caused by the energy transport of secondary particles from inelastic nuclear interactions have not been studied here. Inclusion of inelastic nuclear energy transfers in the cavity dose, assuming total local absorption, indicate that separate scaling of this contribution with the ratio of total inelastic nuclear cross sections could be important

4142	Stereotactic helium ion Bragg peak radiosurgery for angiographically occult intracranial vascular malformations	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebral Angiography, Female, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Ions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Microsurgery, Middle Aged, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	Between July 1983 and July 1989, we treated 35 patients with surgically inaccessible, symptomatic angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs) using stereotactic heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery. AOVMs were located in the brainstem (19), thalamus or internal capsule (9), basal ganglia (3), deep cerebral hemisphere and motor area (3), or cerebellopontine angle (1). All patients presented with clinical and radiological evidence of previous hemorrhage, usually with multiple episodes of hemorrhage. Treatment volumes ranged from 80 to 15,200 mm3 and treatment doses from 7.7 to 34.6 Gy. Mean follow-up was 40 months, with 31 patients followed for at least 2 years. Clinical outcome was excellent in 46%, good in 34% and poor in 14%; 6% died. Twenty-seven patients in excellent and good condition prior to treatment remained stable or improved neurologically. Two patients initially in poor condition, who had previously received conventional radiotherapy, died at 9 and 14 months after treatment, respectively. Six patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage 2-60 months following treatment. Three of these patients made a complete recovery. Although a larger number of treated patients must be followed over longer periods of time, stereotactic heavy-particle radiotherapy may be a valuable treatment modality for surgically inaccessible intracranial AOVMs	
2984	Measurements of phantom scatter factors for small field sizes in high energy x rays	Biophysics, British Columbia, Canada, Humans, Models,Structural, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Scattering,Radiation, Universities, Water, X-Rays	An alternate method to measure the phantom scatter factor in small fields is provided for high energy photon beams. The measurement technique is based on the density scaling theorem described by O'Connor [Phys. Med. Biol. 1, 352-369 (1957)]. The phantom scatter factor (Sp) is measured in balsa and cedar wood to give effective field sizes in 3 x 3 to 0.5 x 0.5 cm2 water. The extrapolated zero area phantom scatter factor from the average data of balsa and cedar is 0.45. This indicates that the variation of output is largely due to a sharp decrease in the phantom scatter factor for small field sizes	
467	Electron radiotherapy: a study on dosimetric uncertainty using small cutouts	Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Electrons, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Technology,Radiologic	This note investigated the dosimetric uncertainties due to the positional error when centring a small cutout to the machine central beam axis (CAX) in electron radiotherapy. A group of six circular cutouts with 4 cm diameter were made with their centres shifting 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mm from the machine CAX for the 6 x 6 cm(2) applicator. The per cent depth doses, beam profiles and output factors were measured using the 4, 9 and 16 MeV clinical electron beams produced by a Varian 21 EX linear accelerator. The 2D isodose distributions in the z-x (or cross-line) and z-y (or in-line) plane were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation using the EGSnrc system. When the cutout centre was shifted away from the machine CAX for the 4 MeV beam, the d(m), R(80) and R(90) at the machine CAX had no significant change (<0.1 mm). For higher energies of 9 and 16 MeV beams, the d(m) was reduced by 0.45 and 1.63 mm per mm, between the cutout centre and the machine CAX with off-axis shift <6 mm respectively. R(80) and R(90) were reduced by more than 0.3 mm per mm off-axis shift for both energies. The isodose coverage of the in-line axis beam profile was reduced when the cutout centre was shifted away from machine CAX. It is important for oncology staff to note such dosimetric changes in the clinical electron radiotherapy, particularly when a high energy electron beam is used for small cutout. Such positional uncertainty is unavoidable in fabricating an electron cutout in the mould room	
3064	Stereotactic heavy-particle irradiation of intracranial arteriovenous malformations	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, California, Californium, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities	Stereotactic irradiation appears to be effective in causing partial or complete thrombosis of AVM that are not surgically resectable. Use of heavy particles generated in a cyclotron allows better spatial definition and dose distribution than do other methods, allowing larger AVM to be treated. From these preliminary results, it is evident that heavy-particle irradiation therapy, like proton beam therapy, does not offer protection from recurrent hemorrhage for at least 12 months, nor is it devoid of major complications; it does offer a noninvasive mode of therapy for AVM that are difficult to treat surgically, however	
2361	Late rectal bleeding following combined X-ray and proton high dose irradiation for patients with stages T3-T4 prostate carcinoma	Arm, Boston, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/ep [Epidemiology], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Hospitalization, Humans, Incidence, Male, Methods, Photons, Probability, Prospective Studies, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectal Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Rectal Diseases/et [Etiology], Rectum, Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Survival Rate, Time Factors	PURPOSE: Dose escalation for prostate cancer by external beam irradiation is feasible by a 160 MeV perineal proton beam that reduces the volume of rectum irradiated. We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding	
2062	The effects of focus-skin distance and shaping block tray on the calibration factor of in-vivo dosimetry diodes	Calibration, Humans, Italy, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Skin, Water	PURPOSE: In-vivo dose measurements during conformal treatment require correction factor evaluations for differences in block shapes, field size and source-skin distance (SSD). The aim of this paper is to evaluate a single correction factor, CFentranceSSD, depending only on source-skin distance, which takes into account both shape and size of blocked fields, in pelvic treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of measurements was performed to investigate the effects of different block shapes and sizes, source-skin distances and collimator settings on the entrance dose values. For this reason EDP 20 Scanditronix diodes, with 20 mm water-equivalent build-up cap, were irradiated by 2 Varian linear accelerators (Clinac 1800 and Clinac 2100) 18 MV photon beams with 3 different collimator settings. Diodes were calibrated by comparison with a Farmer 2571 ionization chamber at reference conditions (10 cm x 10 cm open field, source-skin distance 100 cm, build-up depth 3.3 cm) in order to convert the semiconductor signal into water absorbed dose. Three sets of different measurements (regarding open beams, tray fields and shaped fields) were performed. Diode responses were compared with the ionization chamber ones, in the same irradiation conditions. RESULTS: The CFentranceSSD trends can be described by linear fits in dependence upon source-skin distance, and the effect with tray alone or with tray and blocks is stronger than in the open field. The observed effects can be interpreted by the influences of a) the different source distances of diode and reference point in the phantom and b) the secondary electron contamination of the photon beam upon the calibration factor of the diode. CONCLUSION: The effects of source-skin distance and of the shaping blocks and tray upon the diode calibration factor can be effectively accounted for by a single CFentranceSSD correction factor

Immunochemical analysis of protein expression is presented in a human breast epithelial cell line neoplastically transformed by high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particle radiation in the presence of 17beta estradiol (E) and in the parental human breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10F) which served as a non-tumorigenic control. The aim of this work was to determine the levels of mRNA and protein expression in control and transformed cells at various stages of the neoplastic process. The levels of mRNA and protein expression of PCNA, c-fos, JNK2 and Fra-1 were increased in the transformed cell line compared to the levels in non-tumorigenic control cells. The transforming factor Rho A was significantly increased only in the tumor cell line. Furthermore, the levels of mRNA and protein expression of ErbB2 were significantly increased in the transformed cell line and in tumor cells derived from the transformed cells after injecting them into nude mice. A decrease in RbA/p48 protein expression and mRNA levels was observed in cells treated with double doses of alpha particle radiation in the presence of estrogen, regardless of tumorigenicity. Such expression was lower than that in the control untreated MCF-10F cells. In summary, these studies show that estrogen and high LET-radiation induce changes in oncoprotein expression and mRNA levels of human breast cell lines. These changes are indicative of a cascade of events that characterize the process of cell transformation in breast cancer. These results provide evidence that multiple steps with consecutive changes are involved when normal cells become tumorigenic cells as a result of alpha particle irradiation and estrogen treatments	
2427	On the accuracy of the Fokker-Planck and Fermi pencil beam equations for charged particle transport	Algorithms, Humans, Massachusetts, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Universities	Electron beam dose calculations are often based on pencil beam formulas such as the Fermi-Eyges formula. The Fermi-Eyges formula gives an exact solution of the Fermi equation. The Fermi equation can be derived from a more fundamental mathematical model, the linear Boltzmann equation, in two steps. First, the linear Boltzmann equation is approximated by the Fokker-Planck equation. Second, the Fokker-Planck equation is approximated by the Fermi equation. In this paper, we study these approximations. We use a simplified model problem, but choose parameter values closely resembling those relevant in electron beam therapy. Our main conclusions are: (1) The inaccuracy of the Fokker-Planck approximation is primarily due to neglect of large-angle scattering. (2) When computing an approximate solution to the Fokker-Planck equation by Monte Carlo simulation of a transport process, one should let the polar scattering angle be deterministic. (3) At shallow depths, the discrepancy between the linear Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations is far more important than that between the Fokker-Planck and Fermi equations. The first of these conclusions is certainly not new, but we state and justify it more rigorously than in previous work

METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 2000, 90 patients (median age, 51.3 yr; range, 10-85 yr; male/female ratio, 3:2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. Sixty-four patients had a chordoma, and 26 had a chondrosarcoma. The proton component was delivered by the 201-MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay. The median total dose delivered to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 cobalt Gray equivalents (range, 22-70 cobalt Gray equivalents). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 3-74 mo), treatment of 25 tumors failed locally. The 3-year local control rates were 69.2% (+/-6.0%) and 91.6% (+/-8.4%) for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, a small tumor volume excluded from the 95% isodose line (P = 0.032; relative risk [RR], 0.098; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.81) and a controlled tumor (P = 0.049; RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.99) were independent favorable prognostic factors for overall survival. On multivariate analysis, a high minimum dose (P = 0.02; RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.6), a high tumor control probability (P = 0.02; RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.5), a high dose delivered to 95% of the GTV (P = 0.03; RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.15-10.2), a high GTV encompassed by the 90% isodose line (P = 0.01; RR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.29-8.44), and a small GTV excluded from the 90% isodose line (P = 0.036; RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9) were independent favorable prognostic factors for local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the cranial base and cervical spine treated by surgical resection and then by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose uniformity within the GTV. Special attention must be paid to minimize underdosed areas because of the close proximity of critical structures and to redefine and possibly escalate dose constraints to tumor targets in future studies in view of the low toxicity observed to date

We demonstrate the clinical value of MR spectroscopy in monitoring chemotherapy in a patient with recurrent glioma after stereotactic radiotherapy. Diagnostic imaging before and after chemotherapy included contrast-enhanced MRI, single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H MRS), (1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ((1)H SI), and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET). A significant decrease in choline signal intensity was observed 2 months after chemotherapy indicating tumour chemosensitivity, in line with tumour shrinkage on MRI and decreased uptake of FDG. Assessment of early response by MRS may help to improve treatment protocols in other patients	
1666	Venous malformation serving as the draining vein of an adjoining arteriovenous malformation. Case report and review of the literature. [Review] [19 refs]	Adult, Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/pp [Physiopathology], Cerebral Veins/ab [Abnormalities], Cerebral Veins/pp [Physiopathology], Cerebral Veins/ra [Radiography], Drainage, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pp [Physiopathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Japan, Magnetic Resonance Angiography, Radiosurgery, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	BACKGROUND: Widely accepted pathologic classification of venous malformations includes discrete venous, arteriovenous, capillary, and cavernous malformations, each with distinct pathological criteria for definition. Several authors have described mixed or transitional vascular malformations with pathological features of more than one type of malformation within the same lesion. We present a rare case of a venous malformation associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with a loss of consciousness. Computed tomography showed an enlarged vein running along the lateral wall of the right lateral ventricle. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated an AVM and a venous malformation in the right hemisphere; the AVM and the venous malformation were located in proximity to each other with the AVM using the venous malformation as its draining vein. In this case, where an AVM used the venous malformation as the draining vein, only the AVM was treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated complete obliteration of the AVM with the venous malformation remaining unchanged. CONCLUSION: Arteriovenous shunting would have disturbed venous drainage resulting in the development of the venous malformation. Thus, in addition to demonstrating a rare coexistence of AVM and venous malformation, this case also offers a new insight into the pathogenesis of these vascular malformations. [References: 19]

[German]	Cheek, Electrons, Humans, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	The first betatron developed for current use of fast electrons in radiation therapy (15 MeV, Siemens) has been installed at the Dermatologische Klinik der Universitat Gottingen in 1952 (Bode, Markus). The first human carcinoma treated with fast electrons was irradiated using the first 6-MeV-betatron (Dr. Gund, Siemens) at the 2nd institute of physics of the Gottingen university (Bode, Kopfermann, Paul, 1949). Characteristics of the electron radiation utilized for treatment and its particular advantages in dermatological radation therapy are reported. Two clinical examples, one of them the first human carcinoma irradiated with fast electrons, are described, and the frequency distribution of the indications for electron therapy at the dermatological clinics of the university is tabulated for a total of 3419 cases treated between 1949 and 1972 (Bode et al.)	
1132	The clinical role of N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography in the follow-up of choroidal melanoma after radiotherapy	Adult, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Ciliary Body, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Iofetamine/du [Diagnostic Use], Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Time, Tomography,Emission-Computed,Single-Photon	BACKGROUND: Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) have recently been used for the sensitive and specific detection of melanoma. CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma

This study introduces a statistical method of aggregating and analyzing primary data from DVHs and associated outcomes. It explores the dose-volume relationship for NTCP of the rectum, using long-term data on rectal wall bleeding following prostatic irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Previously published data were reviewed and updated on 41 patients with Stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma treated with photons followed by perineal proton boost, including dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of each patient's anterior rectal wall and data on the occurrence of postirradiation rectal bleeding (minimum FU > 4 years). Logistic regression was used to test whether some individual combination of dose and volume irradiated might best separate the DVHs into categories of high or low risk for rectal bleeding. Further analysis explored whether a group of such dose-volume combinations might be superior in predicting complication risk. These results were compared with results of the "critical volume model," a mathematical model based on assumptions of underlying radiobiological interactions. RESULTS: Ten of the 128 tested dose-volume combinations proved to be "statistically significant combinations" (SSCs) distinguishing between bleeders (14 out of 41) and nonbleeders (27 out of 41), ranging contiguously between 60 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) to 70% of the anterior rectal wall and 75 CGE to 30%. Calculated odds ratios for each SSC were not significantly different across the individual SSCs; however, analysis combining SSCs allowed segregation of DVHs into three risk groups: low, moderate, and high. Estimates of probabilities of normal tissue complications (NTCPs) based on these risk groups correlated strongly with observed data (p = 0.003) and with biomathematical model-generated NTCPs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose-volume relationship for rectal mucosal bleeding in the region between 60 and 75 CGE; therefore, efforts to spare rectal wall volume using improved treatment planning and delivery techniques are important. Stratifying dose-volume histograms (DVHs) into risk groups, as done in this study, represents a useful means of analyzing empirical data as a function of hetereogeneous dose distributions. Modeling efforts may extend these results to more heterogeneous treatment techniques. Such analysis of DVH data may allow practicing clinicians to better assess the risk of various treatments, fields, or doses, when caring for an individual patient

A test procedure sensitive to all of these problems has been developed using an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID). Each marker is placed on top of the EPID housing and on the treatment couch, then two images are acquired for gantry positions 180 degrees apart. By comparing the positions of the markers and their distances to the beam centre, mechanical alignment of the linear accelerator can be assessed. By comparing the positions of the beam centre for another two images acquired at collimator angles 180 degrees apart, the three potential sources of misalignment can be distinguished. Results with Siemens' Beam View were presented and determination accuracy of better than 0.25 mm can be achieved

Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290 MeV/u), silicon (490 MeV/u) and iron (200 MeV/u, 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Prematurely condensed chromosomes were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 minutes, and the number of chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for initial chromatid breaks per unit dose showed LET dependency having a peak at 55 keV/micrometers silicon (2.4) or 80 keV/micrometers carbon particles (2.4) and then decreased with increasing LET. The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components. Chromatid breaks decreased rapidly after exposure, and then continued to decrease at a slower rate. The rejoining kinetics was similar for exposure to each type of radiation, although the rate of unrejoined breaks was higher for high-LET radiation. Chromatid exchanges were also formed quickly

Neoplastic tissues secure supplying in necessary substances for growth and expansion through regulated by its own cells neovasculation. Key role in multipotential cell's differentiation to endothelial cells plays regulatory system consisted of vascular-epithelial growth factor's family (VEGF B, C, D), receptors VEGFR-1, -2, -3, and system Tie2/angiopoetins. Stimulation and importance of angiogenesis for expansion of neoplastic diseases is a current problem in oncology. It is pointed to importance of neovascularization in pathogenesis of acute and chronic leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. The knowledge of the importance ofvascularization of neoplastic tissues is availing in therapy (researching of substances inhibiting angiogenesis--semaxinib, SU6668, ZD 6474, thalidomid, cetuximab, gefitinib, interferon-alpha, irradiation and others), in diagnostics as a monitoring of a success of the therapy, and in prognosis. Inhibitors ofangiogenesis are antineoplastic drugs with relatively lower toxicity, and lower risk of drug-resistance than conventional chemotherapy what has the importance especially during prolong administration, so they can be an alternative way of therapeutic process. During qualification for antiangiogenic therapy it is necessary to have a consciousness of its limited efficiency. [References: 63]	
3029	DNA strand break induction and rejoining and cellular recovery in mammalian cells after heavy-ion irradiation	Animals, Cattle, Cell Line, Cells,Cultured, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, DNA, DNA Damage/re [Radiation Effects], DNA Repair, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Efficiency, Germany, Humans, Ions, Nickel/ch [Chemistry], Radiation, Uranium, Uranium/ch [Chemistry], X-Rays	The induction of intracellular DNA strand breaks by X rays and various heavy charged particles was measured by the alkaline unwinding and alkaline and neutral filter elution techniques. No variations in strand break induction were found between the different cell lines under investigation. For a given particle, both the LET and the particle energy determined the efficiency to induce DNA lesions. RBE values for the total amount of induced strand breaks were always less than 1. For DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), RBE values only slightly greater than 1 were determined for particle radiation with an LET around 300 keV/microns. Intracellular DSB/SSB ratios were found to be equivalent to data reported for in vitro systems using radioprotective conditions [Christensen et al., Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 22, 457-477, 1972; Taucher-Scholz et al., Adv. Space Res. 12(2-3), (2)73-(2)80, 1992]. Strand break rejoining as an indicator of cellular repair processes was detected even after high-LET irradiation (LET < or = 10,000 keV/microns). However, both the half-times of rejoining and the fraction of residual DNA breaks increased with the atomic number of the particle. After particle irradiation with LET values beyond 10,000 keV/microns, no rejoining of DNA strand breaks was found

Effects of X-rays at doses 0.1 cGy--1 Gy depended on post-irradiation time. Significant relaxation of DNA loops followed by a decrease in AVTD. The time of maximum relaxation was between 5-80 min depending on the dose of irradiation. U-shaped dose response was observed with increase of AVTD in the range of 0.1-4 Gy and decrease in AVTD at higher doses. No such increase in AVTD was seen upon irradiation of cells at the beginning of cell lysis while the AVTD decrease was the same. Significant differences in the effects of X-rays and gamma-rays at the same doses were observed suggesting a strong dependence of low-dose effects on LET. Effects of 0.01 cGy gamma-rays were studied at different cell densities during irradiation. We show that the radiation-induced changes in GCS lasted longer at higher cell density as compared to lower cell density. Only small amount of cells were hit at this dose and the data suggest cell-to-cell communication in response to low-dose ionizing radiation. This prolonged effect was also observed when cells were irradiated at high cell density and diluted to low cell density immediately after irradiation. These data suggest that cell-to-cell communication occur during irradiation or within 3 min post-irradiation. The cell-density dependent response to low-dose ionizing radiation was compared with previously reported data on exposure of E. coli cells to electromagnetic fields of extremely low frequency and extremely high frequency (millimeter waves). The body of our data show that cells can communicate in response to electromagnetic fields and ionizing radiation, presumably by reemission of secondary photons in infrared-submillimeter frequency range

Fast neutrons and charged particles emerging from the target were registered at forward angles between 0 degrees and 30 degrees with a DeltaE-E-telescope consisting of an NE102 and a BaF2 scintillator. We obtained neutron energy spectra and angular distributions and derived the neutron yield in the energy range from 10 to 500 MeV in the forward hemisphere. In addition, we performed fragmentation measurements in actual patient treatment irradiations. The resulting angular distributions of neutrons and charged particles as well as their yields are similar to those obtained with the water absorber

An overview of this Cancer Therapy Project is presented, that covers both accelerator aspects to provide the required beam variations within a short time and the installations at the treatment place for rasterscan control.

Two biological end points, delayed apoptosis and chromosomal instability, were studied in descendants of cells irradiated with three different doses of the particular radiation up to 22 population doublings. The delayed apoptosis showed no clear dependence on radiation dose, culture time or radiation quality. A persistent significant increase in the rate of apoptosis up to 36 days after X irradiation was observed for a dose of 4 Gy in donor 1 only. For both donors and radiations, de novo aberration yields were significantly increased in comparison to control values up to day 36. For both radiations, chromosome-type aberrations were seen more frequently than chromatid-type aberrations in both donors up to 22 days postirradiation. In both donors, carbon ions were more effective than X rays with respect to the induction of chromosome instability. A dose of 0.25 Gy of carbon ions corresponding to 1.4 ion traversals per cell nucleus was effective in the induction of instability in our cell system	
208	The impact of advanced technologies on treatment deviations in radiation treatment delivery	Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Prospective Studies, Quality Assurance,Health Care/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Technology,Radiologic/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic/st [Standards]	PURPOSE: To assess the impact of new technologies on deviation rates in radiation therapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment delivery deviations in RT were prospectively monitored during a time of technology upgrade. In January 2003, our department had three accelerators, none with "modern" technologies (e.g., without multileaf collimators [MLC]). In 2003 to 2004, we upgraded to five new accelerators, four with MLC, and associated advanced capabilities. The deviation rates among patients treated on "high-technology" versus "low-technology" machines (defined as those with vs. without MLC) were compared over time using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In 2003, there was no significant difference between the deviation rate in the "high-technology" versus "low-technology" groups (0.16% vs. 0.11%, p = 0.45). In 2005 to 2006, the deviation rate for the "high-technology" groups was lower than the "low-technology" (0.083% vs. 0.21%, p = 0.009). This difference was caused by a decline in deviations on the "high-technology" machines over time (p = 0.053), as well as an unexpected trend toward an increase in deviations over time on the "low-technology" machines (p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Advances in RT delivery systems appear to reduce the rate of treatment deviations. Deviation rates on "high-technology" machines with MLC decline over time, suggesting a learning curve after the introduction of new technologies. Associated with the adoption of "high-technology" was an unexpected increase in the deviation rate with "low-technology" approaches, which may reflect an over-reliance on tools inherent to "high-technology" machines. With the introduction of new technologies, continued diligence is needed to ensure that staff remain proficient with "low-technology" approaches

Previously, we examined the induction of chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) known to be in their 1st cell division following exposure to a low dose (0.5 Gy, average one alpha-particle per cell) of high-LET alpha-particles. We found complex chromosome aberrations to be characteristic of exposure to high-LET radiation and suggested the features of complex exchange to reflect qualitatively the spatial deposition of this densely ionising radiation. To exclude the possibility that BrdU addition post-irradiation influenced the complexity of chromosomal damage observed by m-FISH, the effect of increasing BrdU concentration on aberration complexity was investigated. Comparisons between BrdU concentration (0, 10 and 40 microM) and between sham- and alpha-particle-irradiated PBL, were made both independently and in combination to enable discrimination between BrdU and high-LET radiation effects. Aberration type, size, complexity and completeness were assessed by m-FISH, and the relative progression through cell division was evaluated. We found no evidence of any qualitative difference in the complexity of damage as visualised by m-FISH but did observe an increase in the frequency of complex exchanges with increasing BrdU concentration indicative of altered cell cycle kinetics. The parameters measured here are consistent with findings from previous in vitro and in vivo work, indicating that each complex aberration visualised by m-FISH is characteristic of the structure of the high-LET alpha-particle track and the geometry of cell irradiated

Over 500 patients have now been treated. We have had very good results to date in treating patients with small tumors critically located near a radiation-sensitive organ which would preclude delivering a curative dose with conventional radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients with larger tumors where the tumor dose cannot be increased more than 10% over conventional radiotherapy have not responded well to helium ion radiotherapy. This is illustrated by discussing selected patient groups in detail, namely those with uveal melanoma, small, low-grade tumors near the central nervous system, carcinoma of the pancreas, and carcinoma of the esophagus

Signs of an increased longitudinal relaxation time, T1, were found when normal bone marrow was replaced by malignant cells, polycythemia vera or reactive marrow. A shortened T1 was indicated in 4 patients in bone marrow regions treated by radiation therapy; the marrow was most likely hypocellular in these cases. The estimated T1 relaxation times were highly correlated to the cellularity of the bone marrow as assessed by histology. Among patients with close to 100 per cent cellularity neither T1 nor T2 discriminated between the various malignancies or between malignant and reactive, non-malignant bone marrow. Characterization of tissues in terms of normalized image intensities was also attempted, the motive being to avoid approximations and uncertainties in the assessment of T1 and T2. The normalization was carried out with respect to the image of highest intensity, i.e. the proton density weighted image. The results were in agreement with those for T1 and T2. It was concluded that MRI is valuable for assessing bone marrow cellularity, but not for differentiating between various bone marrow disorders having a similar degree of cellularity

This study was to observe the abrogation of radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest of p53 mutated human cancer cell lines by 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), and explore the mechanism. METHODS: Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-1 and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line 973, both with p53 mutation, were used in this study. Human fibroblastoma cell line HT-1080 was used as control. Flow cytometry was used to observe the effects of irradiation on cell cycle of these 3 cell lines, and abrogation effect of UCN-01 on radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest. Western blot was used to detect phosphorylated CDC2-Tyr15 during the abrogation process. RESULTS: Irradiation resulted in G(2) phase arrest in CNE-1 cells and 973 cells. Proportion of cells in G(2) phase increased from 18.4% to 43.6% in CNE-1 cell line, and from 14.8% to 42.8% in 973 cell line after 2 Gy of irradiation. G(1) phase arrests, measured by "S phase cells consumption", of CNE-1 cells and 973 cells were much lower than that of HT-1080 cells (14.8% and -1.2% vs. 57.0%). Radiation-induced G(2) phase arrests were abrogated by UCN-01 from 63.5% to 16.1% in CNE-1 cell line, and from 35.4% to 16.3% in 973 cell line. UCN-01 suppressed the expression of radiation-induced phosphorylation of CDC2-Tyr15, which was in accordance with the abrogation of radiation-induced G(2) phase delay. CONCLUSIONS: Main effect of irradiation on cell cycle of p53 mutated CNE-1 cells and 973 cells is G(2) phase arrest. UCN-01 is able to abrogate radiation-induced G(2) phase, which is associated with the reduction of phosphorylated CDC2-Tyr15

(1)H magnetic resonance spectra of intact cells harvested at different times after irradiation and of the correspondent perchloric acid (PCA) extracts prepared at different times after irradiation were run. Selected signals from glutathione and lactate were examined with the aim of investigating effects of irradiation on antioxidative stores and on mitochondrial activity. An increase of signal intensity of glutathione (GSH) takes place at 15 and 24 hr after irradiation, while a decrease of its signal intensity, accompanied by an increase of that of free glutamate, starts appearing 48 hr after irradiation. Lactate signal increases 48 hr after irradiation. Signals from lipid catabolites were also examined to explore their sensitivity in predicting the response to radiotherapy. Intensity ratios of signals of glycerophosphorylcholine and choline to that of phosphorylcholine increase with time after irradiation. Irradiating cells with gamma rays or proton beams at half a dose produces effects comparable to the metabolic variations presented here. The present experiments allow more insight into the complex pattern of the changes of GSH by irradiation and indicate that magnetic resonance spectroscopy signals from GSH, glutamate, lactate, and lipid catabolites are affected by irradiation. Finally, these data represent a first indication that the relative biological efficiency for some metabolic damage of low-energy proton beams with respect to gamma rays can reach a value of 2.

Based on the numerous studies which have reported that the local recurrences occurs within and surrounding the primary tumor site and in order to decrease the treatment duration and its morbidity, partial breast irradiation using several techniques has been developed. Partial irradiation may be considered as an alternative local adjuvant treatment for selected patients with favorable prognostic factors. Using external beam radiation therapy, the 3D-conformal technique is appropriate to deliver the whole dose to a limited volume. In UK, an intraoperative technique using a miniature beam of low energy of x-ray (50 Kv) has been developed (Targit). Milan's team have developed an intraoperative electrons beam radiotherapy using a dedicated linear accelerator in the operative room. In USA and Canada the MammoSite has been advised for clinical use in per-operative brachytherapy of the breast. These two last techniques are currently compared in phase III randomised studies to the standard whole breast irradiation followed by a tumour bed booster dose. In this review we will focus on the MammoSite technique and will describe the per-operative implantation procedure, radiological controls ad dosimetric aspects. [References: 25]

This last decade has seen a rapid proliferation in the development of the methodology which is certainly related in part to the simultaneous growth of high-resolution neuro-imaging techniques. By focusing the beams of 201 hemispherically arrayed cobalt 60 sources, the gamma-knife delivers a high dose of radiation to a small target. Another possibility proposed by several authors is the bragg peak cyclotron-generated irradiation with accelerated protons or helium ions. In Lille, since 1988, we have chosen to develop stereotactic radiosurgery, according to the system of Betti, by the association of Talairach's stereotactic methodology and external single-dose encephalic irradiation with high energy X-rays, delivered by means of a linear accelerator. The major indication for the use of this method is an arteriovenous malformation. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be proposed alone or in combination with surgery and embolisation. It has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment and an attractive alternative in carefully selected patients with intracranial tumours: slow-growing, well limited, deep-seated tumours, such as some gliomas, acoustic neurinomas, skull base meningiomas, pituitary adenomas. This treatment is also used to deliver a focal boost of radiation to previously administered fractionated radiotherapy in patients with small gliomas and solitary brain metastases

Thimble ionization chambers with a water absorbed calibration factor are applied. The dose obtained with this method was compared with that obtained at the heavy ion therapy facility HIMAC at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, Japan, using the Japanese code of practice. The agreement found was better than 1%. The combined uncertainty of the determination of absorbed dose to water was estimated to amount to 5%

The aim was to provide maximal local tumor control while minimizing complications such as cranial nerve injuries. METHODS: Thirty-one acoustic neuromas in 30 patients were treated with proton beam therapy from March 1991 to June 1999. The mean tumor volume was 4.3 cm(3). All patients underwent pretreatment neurological evaluation, contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and audiometric evaluation. Standard fractionated proton radiotherapy was used at daily doses of 1.8 to 2.0 cobalt Gray equivalent: patients with useful hearing before treatment (Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II) received 54.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 fractions; patients without useful hearing received 60.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 to 33 fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 30 patients were assessable for tumor control and cranial nerve injury. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 98 months (mean, 34 mo), during which no patients demonstrated disease progression on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Eleven patients demonstrated radiographic regression. Of the 13 patients with pretreatment Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II hearing, 4 (31%) maintained useful hearing. No transient or permanent treatment-related trigeminal or facial nerve dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSION: Fractionated proton beam therapy provided excellent local control of acoustic neuromas when treatment was administered in moderate doses. No injuries to the Vth or VIIth cranial nerves were observed. A reduction in the tumor dose is being evaluated to increase the hearing preservation rate	
2540	A relationship between microdosimetric spectra and cell survival for high-LET irradiation	Australia, Cell Size, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Probability, Radiation, Research, Survival	A method of calculating cell survival from microdosimetric spectra for high-LET radiations and exponential cell survival is discussed. The basis of the calculation is that a cell nucleus receiving a specific dose D has a probability of survival of exp(-D/Do), where Do, the specific lethal dose, is assumed to be independent of cell size and shape. A relationship between specific lethal dose and mean lethal dose is derived. This approach gives the result that mean lethal dose is sensitive to both cell size and shape (cells with disc-shaped and spherical nuclei are treated) and therefore its uses as an indicator of cell sensitivity at high LET must be viewed with caution	
2608	A study of waiting times and waiting lists for radiation therapy patients	Alberta/ep [Epidemiology], Algorithms, Appointments and Schedules, Humans, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiology Department,Hospital/og [Organization & Administration], Radiology Department,Hospital/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Retrospective Studies, Sensitivity and Specificity, Time, Waiting Lists	A simple mathematical model based on queueing theory is introduced, and used to obtain a sensitive measure of the capacity of a radiation therapy centre to provide service. The model illustrates the relationships among the relevant variables: the patient waiting time, the number on the waiting list, the rate at which requests for radiation therapy are received and the rate at which courses of treatment are commenced. In particular, the rate at which the waiting time increases is equal to the difference between the request rate and the start rate, expressed as a fraction of the start rate, and is therefore a measure of the deficiency in service capacity of a facility. A study of the records of patients treated on the linear accelerators of the Tom Baker Cancer Centre from January 1991 to June 1994 shows that this relationship holds to a high degree of accuracy for average values of the various parameters in spite of the considerable variation in these values, and particularly variation in the individual waiting times. This finding suggests that such an approach would be useful in assessing and comparing the performance of radiation therapy facilities	
636	A technique for on-board CT reconstruction using both kilovoltage and megavoltage beam projections for 3D treatment verification	Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiographic Image Enhancement, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	The technologies with kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) imaging in the treatment room are now available for image-guided radiation therapy to improve patient setup and target localization accuracy. However, development of strategies to efficiently and effectively implement these technologies for patient treatment remains challenging. This study proposed an aggregated technique for on-board CT reconstruction using combination of kV and MV beam projections to improve the data acquisition efficiency and image quality. These projections were acquired in the treatment room at the patient treatment position with a new kV imaging device installed on the accelerator gantry, orthogonal to the existing MV portal imaging device. The projection images for a head phantom and a contrast phantom were acquired using both the On-Board Imager kV imaging device and the MV portal imager mounted orthogonally on the gantry of a Varian Clinac 21EX linear accelerator. MV projections were converted into kV information prior to the aggregated CT reconstruction. The multilevel scheme algebraic-reconstruction technique was used to reconstruct CT images involving either full, truncated, or a combination of both full and truncated projections. An adaptive reconstruction method was also applied, based on the limited numbers of kV projections and truncated MV projections, to enhance the anatomical information around the treatment volume and to minimize the radiation dose. The effects of the total number of projections, the combination of kV and MV projections, and the beam truncation of MV projections on the details of reconstructed kV/MV CT images were also investigated

This study presents a method of identifying and measuring the time delay in a gating system. Various port films were taken for a motion phantom at different gating window levels with a very narrow window size. The time delay for the gating system was determined by comparing the motion curve (the position of a moving object versus the gating time) measured in the port films to the motion curve determined by the video cameras. The measured time delay for a linac-based gating system was 0.17+/-0.03 s. This time delay could induce target missing if it was not properly taken into account for the synchronized gating radiotherapy. Measurement/verification of the time delay should be considered as an important part of the accepting/commissioning test before the clinical use of the gating system

There was a rapid formation of MRE11 and gamma-H2AX foci, and 0.5 h after high-LET irradiation, the number of foci in normal cells correlated well with the number of particle hits per cell nucleus. After 8 h of repair, there were significantly more gamma-H2AX foci than MRE11 foci remaining in the normal cells, independent of radiation quality. The difficulty in repairing clustered breaks was detected as slower rejoining of DSBs (measured by DNA fragmentation analysis), as quantification of the amount of gamma-H2AX over time, and as a larger fraction of repair foci remaining after 24 h in cells irradiated with high- LET ions. These data indicate that clustered lesions are repaired by a pathway involving the same proteins that repair sparsely distributed breaks. Further, for both low- and high- LET radiation, no reduction of the initial number of gamma-H2AX and MRE11 foci was detected in M059J cells up to 21 h after irradiation, which was in accordance with a complete absence of DSB rejoining in these cells. In the GM2052D cells there was also a higher level of foci remaining after 21 h; however, this was not accompanied by unrejoined DSBs, indicating that these foci not only represent DSBs but also may be a sign of persistent problems even when breaks are rejoined	
3414	Neon ion radiotherapy: results of the phase I/II clinical trial	California, Californium, Cell Cycle, Drug Evaluation, Head, Humans, Ions, Lung, Male, Neck, Neon, Neon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oxygen, Prostate, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Retrospective Studies, Sarcoma, Survival, Survivors, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	Neon ion radiotherapy possesses biologic and physical advantages over megavoltage X rays. Biologically, the neon beam reduces the oxygen enhancement ratio and increases relative biological effectiveness. Cells irradiated by neon ions show less variation in cell-cycle related radiosensitivity and decreased repair of radiation injury. The physical behavior of heavy charged particles allows precise delivery of high radiation doses to tumors while minimizing irradiation of normal tissues. In 1979 a Phase I-II clinical trial was started at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory using neon ions to irradiate patients for whom conventional treatment modalities were ineffective. By the end of 1988 a total of 239 patients had received a minimum neon physical dose of 1000 cGy (median follow-up for survivors 32 months). Compared with historical results, the 5-year actuarial disease-specific survival (DSS5) and local control (LC5) rates suggest that neon treatment improves outcome for several types of tumors: a) advanced or recurrent macroscopic salivary gland carcinomas (DSS5 59%; LC5 61%); b) paranasal sinus tumors (DSS5 69%; LC5 69% for macroscopic disease); c) advanced soft tissue sarcomas (DSS5 56%, LC5 56% for macroscopic disease); d) macroscopic sarcomas of bone (DSS5 45%; LC5 59%); e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas (DSS5 90%; LC5 75%); and f) biliary tract carcinomas (DSS5 28%; LC5 44%). Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, lung, and advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer has been less successful; results for these tumors appear no better than those achieved with conventional x-ray therapy. These findings suggest that Phase III trials using the neon beam should be implemented for selected malignancies

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

Treatment techniques using moving beam therapy with fields asymmetric with respect to rotational axis of the collimator head allow treatment of such target volumes with minimal dose to critical structures. The availability of independent motion of the collimator jaws on new medical accelerators allows easy setting up of asymmetric treatment portals. Therefore, treatment techniques utilizing asymmetric field arc rotations with acceptable dose distributions have been possible

Single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs) are distributed stochastically onto the DNA molecule and additional DSBs are recorded. Consideration of this additional damage leads to a modification of the underlying photon survival curve at high doses. As a consequence of the new approach, the ratio of maximum relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values to minimum RBEs is increased. This can be understood in terms of a higher radiation effect resulting from the cluster damage at high local doses. We find that the extended LEM including cluster effects reproduces experimental data for V79 cells significantly better than the original LEM

With the advent of three-dimensional treatment planning, the therapeutic index was increased by dose escalation and more accurate shielding of normal tissues. Now, even greater advances are under way with IMRT, image-guided radiation therapy, delineation and control of organ motion, and real-time imaging. Similarly, the use of particle therapies such as protons has the potential to effect even more accurate dose distributions. Clinical studies investigating these modalities will likely further increase the efficacy of radiation in years to come. [References: 68]

Application of these technologies in the treatment of rectal and anal cancer is attractive, based on the potential reduction in radiation treatment toxicities that are frequently incurred in the pelvis and perineum. Furthermore, conformal RT might also allow for dose escalation to target areas, leading to improved tumor control. This review discusses the underlying principles of IMRT. In addition, the rationale and clinical data regarding the efficacy of radiation dose escalation for rectal and anal cancer will be highlighted, as well as tolerance of pelvic organs to RT and chemotherapy. Finally, preliminary results of IMRT in the treatment of lower gastrointestinal tract cancers will be reviewed. The potential and rationale for proton therapy in treatment of these malignancies are also discussed. [References: 81]	
1850	A consistent set of neutron kerma coefficients from thermal to 150 MeV for biologically important materials	Biophysics, California, Carbon, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Isotopes, Models,Theoretical, Muscles/re [Radiation Effects], Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Oxygen, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Universities, Water	Neutron cross sections for nonelastic and elastic reactions on a range of elements have been evaluated for incident energies up to 150 MeV. These cross sections agree well with experimental cross section data for charged-particle production as well as neutron and photon production. Therefore they can be used to determine kerma coefficients for calculations of energy deposition by neutrons in matter. Methods used to evaluate the neutron cross sections above 20 MeV, using nuclear model calculations and experimental data, are described. Below 20 MeV, the evaluated cross sections from the ENDF/B-VI library are adopted. Comparisons are shown between the evaluated charged-particle production cross sections and measured data. Kerma coefficients are derived from the neutron cross sections, for major isotopes of H, C, N, O, Al, Si, P, Ca, Fe, Cu, W, Pb, and for ICRU-muscle, A-150 tissue-equivalent plastic, and other compounds important for treatment planning and dosimetry. Numerous comparisons are made between our kerma coefficients and experimental kerma coefficient data, to validate our results, and agreement is found to be good. An important quantity in neutron dosimetry is the kerma coefficient ratio of ICRU-muscle to A-150 plastic. When this ratio is calculated from our kerma coefficient data, and averaged over the neutron energy spectra for higher-energy clinical therapy beams [three p (68) + Be beams, and a d (48.5) + Be beam], a value of 0.94 +/- 0.03 is obtained. Kerma ratios for water to A-150 plastic, and carbon to oxygen, are also compared with measurements where available

[Review] [33 refs]	Bone Marrow Transplantation/ae [Adverse Effects], Energy Transfer, Graft vs Host Disease/dt [Drug Therapy], Graft vs Host Disease/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Isotopes, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Research, Survival	Effective prophylaxis of acute GVHD should bring about improved patient survival by decreasing severe infections during the first 3 months after transplantation and reducing the incidence of chronic GVHD while not compromising the quality of hematopoietic engraftment or increasing the incidence of leukemic relapse by impairing the graft-versus-leukemia effect. None of the current approaches to prevention of GVHD succeed at meeting these expectations, although postgrafting immunosuppressive therapy comes closest to the ideal. The technique of T cell depletion has been very effective in reducing the incidence of GVHD, but conditioning programs must be developed that will be more successful at eliminating host immune and malignant cells. It is doubtful that this will be achieved with systemic chemotherapy and total body irradiation. Innovative approaches such as the use of monoclonal antibodies, either alone or linked to short-lived radioactive isotopes with short linear energy transfer, promise to result in less toxic but more efficient programs, not only providing better eradication of malignant disease but also ameliorating the problem of graft failure. It is conceivable, however, that it will never be possible to kill all leukemic cells with chemoradiotherapy of any form, and the graft-versus-leukemia effect may be essential. Perhaps in the future it will be possible to distinguish lymphocytes causing the graft-versus-leukemia effect from those causing GVHD, isolate them, and use them in attempts at therapy. In the meantime, postgrafting immunosuppressive drugs are used most frequently to prevent and treat GVHD, and steadily improving survival statistics can be expected. [References: 33]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A human glioma cell line M059J lacking the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) and its DNA-PKcs-proficient counterpart, M059K, were exposed to 1 and 4 Gy of accelerated nitrogen ions (14N, 140 eV nm(-1), 8-12 Gy min(-1)) or 60Co gamma-rays (0.2 eV nm(-1), 0.7 Gy min(-1)). The induction of apoptosis was studied up to 144 h post-irradiation using two different methods: morphological characterization of apoptotic cells after fluorescent staining and cell size distribution analysis to detect apoptotic bodies. In parallel, protein expression of DNA-PKcs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as well as DNA-PK and caspase-3 activity were investigated. RESULTS: Low and high LET radiations (4 Gy) induced a time-dependent apoptotic response in both cell lines. Low LET radiation induced a significantly elevated apoptotic response in M059J as compared with M059K cells at 144 h post-irradiation. Following high LET radiation exposure, there was no difference between the cell lines at this time. PARP cleavage was detected in M059J cells following both low and high LET irradiation, while only high LET radiation induced PARP cleavage in M059K cells. These cleavages occurred in the absence of caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: M059J and M059K cells both display radiation-induced apoptosis, which occur independently of caspase-3 activation. The apoptotic course differs between the two cell lines and is dependent on the quality of radiation

A current treatment recommendation for nonmetastatic, high-risk disease includes AS combined with RT. The precise duration and sequencing of AS has not been established but most frequently includes treatment in the neoadjuvant, concomitant and, occasionally, adjuvant periods. As technology allows higher doses without significant increases in morbidity and as clinical data provide proof of a radiation dose response, RT doses continue to escalate. The goal of therapy for metastatic disease continues to focus on the relief of pain and the improvement in quality of life. Multiple studies document the significant role RT plays in achieving these goals. Focal RT and systemic radioisotopes have become the mainstay of management in this patient group and the development of newer isotopes that cause less marrow toxicity will improve the therapeutic ratio and provide an opportunity for their use with systemic chemotherapy. As molecular and genomic technologies advance, directed targeting of critical cellular radiation-response pathways hold the promise of improved radiation response and individualized, tailored therapy.

This article surveys the clinical and pathologic features of these lesions. In recent years there have been remarkable advances in both the imaging and treatment of these lesions. Both CT scanning and MR imaging are usually necessary for the complete evaluation of these tumors because of the involvement of both soft tissue and bony structures at the skull base. New surgical techniques and the use of high-energy proton beam irradiation have improved the prognosis for patients with these lesions. [References: 53]

The system consists of a scintillating screen (Gd2O2S:Tb), mounted at the beam-exit side of a phantom, and observed by a low noise CCD camera with a long integration time. The purpose of the instrument is to make a fast and accurate two-dimensional image of the dose distribution at the screen position in the phantom. The linearity of the signal with the dose, the noise in the signal, the influence of the ionization density on the signal, and the influence of the field size on the signal have been investigated. The spatial resolution is 1.3 mm (1 s.d.), which is sufficiently smaller than typical penumbras in dose distributions. The measured yield depends linearly on the dose and agrees within 5% with the calculations. In the images a signal to noise ration (signal/1 s.d.) of 10(2) has been found, which is in the same order of magnitude as expected from the calculations. At locations in the dose distribution possessing a strong contribution of high ionization densities (i.e., in the Bragg peak), we found some quenching of the light output, which can be described well by existing models if the beam characteristics are known. For clinically used beam characteristics such as a Spread Out Bragg peak, there is at most 8% deviation from the NACP ionization chamber measurements. The conclusion is that this instrument is a useful tool for quick and reliable quality control of proton beams. The long integration-time capabilities of the system make it worthwhile to investigate its applicability in scanning proton beams and other dynamic treatment modalities	
1301	Commissioning and clinical implementation of a sliding gantry CT scanner installed in an existing treatment room and early clinical experience for precise tumor localization	Carbon, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology/st [Standards], Tomography Scanners,X-Ray Computed/st [Standards], Tomography Scanners,X-Ray Computed, Uncertainty	The primary objective of the present study is to demonstrate that a unique computed tomography (CT)-linear accelerator combination can be used to reduce uncertainties caused by organ motion and setup inaccuracy. The acceptance, commissioning, and clinical implementation of a sliding gantry CT scanner installed in an existing linear accelerator room are reported in this paper. A Siemens CT scanner was installed directly opposite to an existing accelerator. The scanner is movable on a pair of horizontal rails mounted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the treatment couch replaced with a carbon fiber tabletop. Acceptance and commissioning of the CT scanner were verified with phantom studies. For clinical implementation, quality assurance (QA) procedures have been instituted to ensure the integrity of the CT gantry axis alignment and the accuracy of its movement using a phantom designed in house. A clinical example employing the CT-Linac combination to correct the isocenter positioning caused by organ motion and setup inaccuracy was presented for a prostate irradiation. Dose calculations were performed to study the effects on tumor coverage without the adjustments of the isocenter. A summary of the isocenter adjustments for the first 30 patients is also presented. The geometric accuracy of the CT scanner is < or =1 mm. An isocenter deviation of > or =2 mm from the original plan can be detected. For the clinical example of a prostate patient, the average movement of the prostate gland was found to be approximately 3mm in the anterior-posterior (AP/PA) direction and 5 mm in the cephalic-caudal direction. Variations in the isocenter position may result in underdosage of the PTV if correction is not made for the change in the isocenter position. Our experience with the first 30 patients indicates that while the left-right adjustment of the isocenter is minimal, in the AP/PA direction, about 33% of treatments required an adjustment of 3-5 mm, and about 18% required a 5.1-mm to 10-mm adjustment. In the caudal-cephalic direction, about 26% required an adjustment of 3-5 mm, and 8% required a 5.1-mm to 10-mm adjustment. Retrofitting a CT scanner in an existing linear accelerator room requires careful planning and well-coordinated efforts from all personnel involved. Special QA procedures are needed to ensure the mechanical integrity and imaging accuracy of the CT scanner. A CT scan of the patient prior to irradiation provides valuable information on organ motion. Any deviations from treatment plan can be corrected before dose delivery. Significant deviation from the planning isocenter may occur due to daily variations in the rectal filling. The CT-Linac combination has significant implications for the treatment of prostate cancer

In our department, between January 1995 to January 2001, we treated eleven patients with mycosis fungoides by total body skin electron irradiation to evaluate its influence. According to our knowledge, our department is the only center in Turkey capable of applying total skin electron beam therapy. Total skin electron beam therapy was applied by using the "translational technique". Daily doses (4 Gray) were given in a total of seven fractions according to the conventional fractionation scheme. There were 6 patients with stage I disease, 3 patients with stage II and 2 patients with stage IV disease. Except stage IV patients, we obtained good cutaneous results. According to our observation, in early stage mycosis fungoides total body skin electron irradiation can provide good cutaneous response, but for stage IV only moderate pallation can be obtained

Some commonly used formulas for predicting risk are based on extrapolation from small numbers of animal experiments, pilot human treatment series, and theoretical radiobiological considerations. The authors studied the incidence of complications after AVM radiosurgery in relation to dose, volume, and other factors in a large patient series. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in 1329 patients with AVM treated by Dr. Raymond Kjellberg at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between 1965 and 1993. Dose and volume were obtained from HCL records, and information about patient follow up was derived from concurrent clinical records, questionnaires, and contact with referring physicians. Multivariate logistic regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals was used. Follow up was available in 1250 patients (94%); the median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. The median radiation dose was 10.5 Gy and the median treatment volume was 33.7 cm(3). Twenty-three percent of treated lesions were smaller than 10 cm(3). Fifty-one permanent radiation-related deficits occurred (4.1%). Of 1043 patients treated with a dose predicted by the Kjellberg isoeffective centile curve to have a less than 1% complication risk, 1.8% suffered radiation-related complications. Actual complication rates were 4.7% for 128 patients treated at Kjellberg risk centile doses of 1 to 1.8%, and 34% for 61 patients treated at risk centile doses of 2 to 2.5%. The fitted logistic model showed that complication risk was related to treatment dose and volume, thalamic or brainstem location, and patient age. CONCLUSIONS: The Kjellberg isoeffective risk centile curve significantly underpredicted actual risks of permanent complications after proton beam radiosurgery for AVMs. Actual risks were best predicted using a model that accounted for treatment dose and volume, lesion location, and patient age

The expression approximates well the measured electron beam data in the field size range from 4 x 4 cm2 to 25 x 25 cm2 and in the energy range from 6 to 20 MeV in all four regions of the electron depth dose curve: build-up, dose maximum, dose fall-off, and bremsstrahlung contamination	
2402	Beam delivery systems for charged particles. [Review] [40 refs]	Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Research, Switzerland	Heavy charged particle therapy, started at research institutes three decades ago, is now on the verge of entering a clinical phase. This phase has resulted from the evolution and development of various beam delivery systems and techniques with existing research accelerators and with newly built accelerators. For the first thirty years, heavy charged particle therapy was administered with a fixed horizontal beam line. In 1991, the first treatment with an isocentric gantry was administered. The development of the isocentric gantry, the newest beam delivery system, and clearly a consequence of all the experience gained at the earlier facilities has many advantages. It offers advantageous physical properties of the particles as well as being equal in the flexibility of dose delivery to the modern photon radiotherapy gantries. [References: 40]

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons	
3431	Non-random distribution of DNA double-strand breaks induced by particle irradiation	Blotting,Southern, California, Californium, Cells,Cultured, DNA, DNA Damage, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Efficiency, Electrophoresis,Gel,Pulsed-Field, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Ions, Nucleic Acid Hybridization, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation,Ionizing, Research, Universities, X-Rays	Induction of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs) in mammalian cells is dependent on the spatial distribution of energy deposition from the ionizing radiation. For high LET particle radiations the primary ionization sites occur in a correlated manner along the track of the particles, while for X-rays these sites are much more randomly distributed throughout the volume of the cell. It can therefore be expected that the distribution of dsbs linearly along the DNA molecule also varies with the type of radiation and the ionization density. Using pulsed-field gel and conventional gel techniques, we measured the size distribution of DNA molecules from irradiated human fibroblasts in the total range of 0.1 kbp-10 Mbp for X-rays and high LET particles (N ions, 97 keV/microns and Fe ions, 150 keV/microns). On a mega base pair scale we applied conventional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques such as measurement of the fraction of DNA released from the well (FAR) and measurement of breakage within a specific NotI restriction fragment (hybridization assay). The induction rate for widely spaced breaks was found to decrease with LET. However, when the entire distribution of radiation-induced fragments was analysed, we detected an excess of fragments with sizes below about 200 kbp for the particles compared with X-irradiation. X-rays are thus more effective than high LET radiations in producing large DNA fragments but less effective in the production of smaller fragments. We determined the total induction rate of dsbs for the three radiations based on a quantitative analysis of all the measured radiation-induced fragments and found that the high LET particles were more efficient than X-rays at inducing dsbs, indicating an increasing total efficiency with LET. Conventional assays that are based only on the measurement of large fragments are therefore misleading when determining total dsb induction rates of high LET particles. The possible biological significance of this non-randomness for dsb induction is discussed	
1764	Cell killing and mutation induction by heavy ion beams	Animals, Carbon, Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Japan, Mutation, Mutation/re [Radiation Effects], Neon, Radiotherapy, Research, Survival, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities, X-Rays	Carbon beam radiotherapy for cancer patients was initiated in Japan in June 1994. This study attempts to clarify the radiobiological effects of heavy ion beams. In this study, human cancer cell lines (RMG-1, MDA-MB231) and V79 cells were used. The cell killing was determined by colony forming assay, and mutation induction was determined by counting the number of 6-thioguanine resistant colonies (hprt locus mutation assay). The cell lines were irradiated with carbon (20 or 80 keV/microm) or neon beams (80 keV/microm). Carbon ions with a higher LET value (80 keV/microm) had an enhanced cytotoxic effect compared to those with a lower LET value (20 keV/microm). Carbon beams produced a slightly stronger cytotoxic effect than neon beams when irradiated at the same LET level (80 keV/microm), but the difference was not remarkable. The mutant fraction was significantly higher in all cell lines when they were irradiated with heavy ion beams, compared to the results for X-ray irradiation. The mutant fraction increased when the LET of the carbon beams increased. At equivalent LET values, the mutant fraction was lower for neon beams than for carbon beams. Fractionation of carbon beam irradiation had no effect on survival, but reduced the mutant fraction. Neon beams might be more appropriate for heavy ion therapy, especially when higher doses are being used. In addition, the fractionation of heavy ion beam administration might be appropriate for reducing the mutant fraction	
4482	Input/output characteristics of a matrix ion-chamber electronic portal imaging device	Calibration, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiography/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Universities	The input/output characteristics of a matrix liquid ion-chamber electronic portal imaging device (EPID) are investigated to elucidate the imaging properties of EPIDs. The radiation input to the detector, represented by dose rate, and the pixel value output from the device are related by a characteristic curve. Various incident radiation intensities are obtained by changing the source-to-detector distance (SDD). For each incident radiation intensity, an electronic portal image is obtained using a field size of 5 x 5 cm2. The output pixel value of the EPID is represented by the average pixel value of a region of interest of 9 x 9 pixels centered at a selected point. The effects of various accelerator settings, such as the repetition-rate setting and photon energy, gantry angle, field size, SDD, and acquisition mode of the EPID on characteristic curves are investigated at the central axis. The off-axis response of the detector is also examined. The derivative of the pixel value with respect to the input dose rate is used to analyze the detector contrast. Results indicate that the output pixel value is not a linear function of the incident radiation intensity. The detector contrast is comparable between photon energies of 10 and 6 MV and increases at low dose rates. The response of the imaging device varies substantially with acquisition mode, but is less sensitive to the SDD used for calibration. Characteristic curves are consistent for different gantry angles at the central axis and with the off-axis locations when the gantry angle is used for imaging and calibration, but vary with off-axis locations when the gantry angle is not at the calibration direction. Characteristic curves are also found to vary with different field sizes, but are similar in shape

J. Karzmark, Br. J. Radiol. 40, 697 (1967)]. Measurements were taken on two accelerators to determine the size of the doses which were possible. The experiments demonstrate the limitations of many of the commonly used dosimeters when they are used outside of the dose and dose rate ranges normally encountered in a radiotherapy department. Dose rates from 110 to 165 cGy/pulse were measured using ionization chamber, ferrous sulphate and thermoluminescent dosimetry, and water calorimetry

The assessment included a review of future developments in radiotherapy and an estimate of the potential benefits of improved radiotherapy in Sweden. The conclusions reached from this review can be summarized as: Successively better knowledge is available on dose-response relationships for tumours and normal tissues at different fractionation schedules and treated volumes. Optimization of dose levels and fractionation schedules should improve the treatment outcome. Improved treatment results may be expected with even more optimized fractionation schedules. The radiosensitivity of the tumour is dependent on the availability of free oxygen in the cells. The oxygen effect has been studied for a long time and new knowledge has emerged, but there is still no consensus on the best way to minimize its negative effect in the treatment of hypoxic tumours. Development in imaging techniques is rapid, improving accuracy in outlining targets and organs at risk. This is a prerequisite for advanced treatment planning. More accurate treatment can be obtained using all the computer techniques that are successively made available for calculating dose distributions, controlling the accelerator and multileaf collimator (MLC) and checking patient set-up. Optimized treatment plans can be achieved using inverse dose planning and intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT). Optimization algorithms based on biological data from clinical trials could be a part of future dose planning. New genetic markers might be developed that give a measure of the radiation responsiveness of tumours and normal tissue. This could lead to more individualized treatments. New types of radiation sources may be expected: protons, light ions, and improved beams (and compounds) for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Proton accelerators with scanned-beam systems and energy modulation give good dose distribution. The results reported with carbon ions from Japan and Germany are promising. An interesting development is to verify the dose and position for the irradiated volume with PET on line. Safer margins are obtained and the treatment volume can thus be limited. Very large accelerators are needed to accelerate the carbon ions. Still, it should be possible to keep the costs per patient at the same level as those for other types of advanced radiotherapy, since far fewer treatments per patient are needed. It might also be possible to treat new groups of patients. Increased resources are needed to introduce all the currently available techniques. New types of particle accelerators require large investments and a new structure of radiotherapy in Sweden	
3562	A parameterization of the electron beam output factors of a 25-MeV linear accelerator	Humans, Methods, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Uncertainty	A new parameterization of the output factors of an electron beam has been developed. The output factors for the electron beams of an AECL Therac-25 have been determined for a variety of square and rectangular fields using ionization measurements and thermoluminescent dosimetry. The data were then least-squares fit by a semiempirical equation which treats the two field dimensions as variables. Such a parameterization allows computer-generated tables of output factors to be manufactured. The calculated values agree with the measured data in most cases to within the +/- 1% experimental uncertainty. A comparison between this method of calculating output factors and two conventional methods is also presented

These were reviewed at a minimum follow-up of three years to determine the effect of irradiation on infection, the complications and the functional result. No bacteriological infection was seen in the 44 patients who had allografts for revision of joint arthroplasty or for a tumour with no adjuvant therapy. For the 83 patients who also had chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both for a bone tumour, the rate of infection was 13%. The major mechanical complications were nonunion in seven grafts (5.5%) and fracture in eight (6%). These rates do not differ greatly from those reported for non-irradiated grafts. Our results suggest that irradiation, which remains the most convenient and acceptable method of sterilisation, does not jeopardize the clinical results

The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described. [References: 15]	
93	Is there a role for heavy ion beam therapy?. [Review] [21 refs]	Carbon, Electrons, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The aim of this contribution is to review the radio-oncological rationale of heavy ion beam radiotherapy in the management of cancer. Protons and helium ions are being investigated because of the improved dose distributions, perhaps superior in many clinical situations to those obtainable with photons or electrons. Heavy ions also bear the advantage of superior dose distribution and may additionally provide higher biological effectivity. A substantial database of historical results supports the hypothesis that conformal radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy. For the selection of patients for ion beam therapy, the following questions have to be evaluated: Can any significant radiation morbidity by conventional treatment expected? Is the radiation morbidity caused by unintended irradiation of non-target tissue outside the planning target volume? Can the tumor control be improved due to dose escalation with less radiation morbidity? A substantial number of patients have been treated by light ion radiotherapy. There are only a few clinical trials attempting to compare conventional photon radiotherapy with light ion radiotherapy. Clinical results with heavy ions such as carbon ions seem very promising in certain tumors. However results of randomized trials are still to be seen. Clearly the control arm has to be designed to be as close as possible to the optimal photon/electron treatment methods in use. The feasibility of heavy ion treatment has been demonstrated worldwide, with more than 10,000 patients. In the near future more centers worldwide will start patient treatments. The wider availability of light ion beams for clinical use will enable the establishment of a database of clinical results and the elucidation of the role of heavy ion beams in the treatment of cancer.

1098	Monte Carlo dose calculations for radiotherapy machines: Theratron 780-C teletherapy case study	Air, Algorithms, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Head, Humans, Lead, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Water, Water/ch [Chemistry]	The Monte Carlo transport code MCNP was used to simulate the photon beam from a Theratronics 780-C cobalt therapy unit and to calculate some dose-dependent parameters as functions of field size. The simulation process has included the source capsule, collimators (fixed and adjustable), lead in the unit head, and the field sizes as ranged from 5 x 5 to 35 x 35 cm2. Calculations have been carried out in a water phantom at a fixed source-surface distance of 80 cm. Detailed simulation of the major components of the therapy unit made it possible to calculate the effects of each unit component on the photon spectrum at the phantom surface. Percentage depth dose and peak scatter factor were evaluated for various field sizes. And tissue-air ratios were also determined for a field size of 10 x 10 cm2, as a function of depth down to 30 cm. To test the accuracy of the calculated results, they were compared with the published data of the British Journal of Radiology (BJR) suppl. 25 and good agreement between measurements and calculations has been obtained. Deviations typically were found to be of the order of 1%	
112	A simple algorithm for planar image registration in radiation therapy	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Humans, Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiographic Image Enhancement, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Technology,Radiologic	A simple algorithm is presented for planar image registration and the method is applied to the simulator and portal image registration for patient setup verification in radiation therapy. Basically, the algorithm follows the concept proposed by Balter et al. [Med. Phys. 19, 329-334 (1992)], which converts the problem of open curve registration into matching a series of points along the curves. Balter's algorithm consists of three steps: (1) to determine a common starting point for each curve pair, (2) acquire two corresponding point sets along each curve, and (3) obtain a global transform matrix by matching two point sets. We integrate all three steps into one simple procedure which fits the sampled points along the intended curve pair by taking the relative path length shift as an independent fitting parameter. After being modified, the algorithm is able to take the different magnification factors of images into account, and it avoids curvature calculations. Numerical simulation as well as clinical and phantom images have been utilized to test the accuracy of the algorithm. The typical errors are less than 1 mm in translation and 1 degree in rotation. We also made a comparison study with the chamfer method. The results of the two methods agree to within 0.5 mm in translation and 0.5 degree in rotation

Patient immobilization and imaging are also discussed. [References: 100]	
4583	Comparative planning study for proton radiotherapy of benign brain tumors	Adenoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Humans, Life Expectancy, Male, Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Neurilemmoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: A comparative study of different systems for proton-based radiotherapy was conducted. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Paul Scherrer Institute method for spot scanning was compared with the systems for passive scattering from the Helax-TMS and the Varian Eclipse. Twelve cases of "benign" brain tumors were considered (meningiomas, neurinomas, and hypophyseal adenomas). Organs at risk included chiasm, brainstem, eyes and optic nerves as well as the not otherwise specified healthy brain tissue in view of long-term toxicity. RESULTS: The results showed that high target coverage was achievable (V(90) > 98% for all systems). Plans designed with the spot-scanning technique presented the minimum involvement of healthy tissue (e. g., the lowest maximum significant dose to healthy brain [25.6 Gy] or the lowest conformity index [CI(95) = 1.3], between 38% and 46% lower than for the other techniques). CONCLUSION: In this study, no definitive indication of superiority of any technique can be drawn but spot scanning can better conform dose distributions and minimize the irradiation of healthy volumes at medium to low dose levels, a factor of interest when long life expectancy is considered

[Review] [149 refs]	Adenoma/et [Etiology], Carcinoma/et [Etiology], Goiter,Nodular/et [Etiology], Graves Disease/et [Etiology], Humans, Hypothyroidism/et [Etiology], Italy, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Risk, Risk Assessment, Thyroid Diseases/et [Etiology], Thyroid Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Thyroid Gland, Thyroid Gland/re [Radiation Effects], Thyroid Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Thyroiditis/et [Etiology]	Despite their specific functional consequences, radiotherapy-induced thyroid abnormalities remain under-estimated and underreported. These sequelae may include primary or central hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, Graves' disease, euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy, benign adenomas, multinodular goitre and radiation-induced thyroid carcinoma. Primary hypothyroidism, the most common radiation-induced thyroid dysfunction, affects 20-30% of patients administered following curative radiotherapy to the neck region, with approximately half of the events occurring within the first 5 years after therapy. The relative risk of radiation-induced cancer (mainly well-differentiated tumours) is 15-53-fold higher than in non-irradiated population. The aetiology of radiation-induced thyroid injury includes vascular damage, parenchymal cell damage and auto-immune reactions. Total radiotherapy dose, irradiated volume of the thyroid gland, and the extent of prior thyroid resection are among the most important factors associated with the risk of hypothyroidism. The contribution of other treatment modalities (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy) as well as patient- and tumour-related factors is less clear. Reduction in radiation dose to the thyroid gland and hypothalamic/pituitary complex should be attempted whenever possible. New radiotherapy techniques, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, three-dimensional conformal irradiation, intensity modulated radiotherapy and proton therapy allow generally better dose distribution with lower dose to the non-target organs. The diagnostic approach to thyroid radiation injury includes baseline thyroid function assays in all patients undergoing thyroid or parasellar irradiation. Recommended follow-up procedures include at least annual evaluation with a history for symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, clinical examination, and measurement of thyroid hormones and thyrotropin. Management of overt hypothyroidism is based on hormone replacement therapy. Thyroid hormone therapy is also recommended in cases of subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment of other radiation-induced thyroid disorders (thyroiditis, Graves' disease, thyroid cancer) is similar to that employed in spontaneously occurring conditions. Further improvements in radiotherapy techniques and progress in endocrine diagnostics and therapy may allow better prevention and management of radiation-related thyroid injury. [References: 149]	
422	[Experimental validation of a Monte Carlo-based treatment-planning system for electron beams]. [German]	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	BACKGROUND: Commercial, Monte Carlo-based 3-D treatment-planning systems will become more important for electron beams, e. g., for combined electron-photon fields or for intensity-modulated electron beams. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the commercial Monte Carlo algorithm (Oncentra MasterPlan 1.42), simulations were compared with measured data for electron energies from 4 MeV to 18 MeV of an Elekta linear accelerator. For the standard applicator size 14 x 14 cm(2) different square and rectangular apertures down to 2 x 2 cm(2) and arranged symmetrically as well as asymmetrically were fabricated. After optimizing the simulation parameters, depth dose curves, profiles and output factors were compared. RESULTS: The results for standard electron applicators are satisfying in most cases. However, a major problem of this actual release is the resolution of the calculation matrix fixed by phantom size. From there, larger deviations up to 11% occur with decreasing aperture size for low and high electron energies, especially in the output factors. At medium electron energies and not too small apertures the simulations can be used clinically. CONCLUSION: The Monte Carlo algorithm of the Oncentra MasterPlan treatment-planning system 1.42 can be used clinically in a wide range. However, a critical checkup of the results is necessary because nonacceptable deviations at low and high electron energies can occur in small electron fields	
3228	Complications after proton beam therapy for uveal malignant melanoma. A clinical and histopathologic study of five cases	Adult, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Humans, Liver, Melanoma, Melanoma/di [Diagnosis], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mitosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiation Injuries/su [Surgery], Research, Texas, Ultrasonography, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vitreous Hemorrhage/et [Etiology]	Proton beam therapy for uveal malignant melanoma has been advocated as effective therapy because of documented reduction in tumor size and few clinical complications. However, some eyes have been removed because of adverse effects. The authors report the clinical courses and pathologic findings of five eyes enucleated after proton beam irradiation. Neovascular glaucoma had developed in three eyes, two eyes had vitreous hemorrhage, and two had extraocular extension. The tumors in the radiation treatment field showed continued postirradiation growth clinically in four of the five eyes, and mitotic activity histologically in all five cases. Two and one half years after irradiation, and nearly 2 years after subsequent enucleation, one of those two patients had biopsy-proven liver metastases, and later died. Despite the considerable success rate of proton beam irradiation, the potential for clinical complications and subsequent tumor growth remains

A technical feasibility study, in collaboration with Elekta Oncology Systems and Philips Medical Systems, led to the preliminary design specifications of a MRI accelerator. Basically the design is a 6 MV accelerator rotating around a 1.5 T MRI system. Several technical issues and the clinical rational are currently under investigation. The aim of this paper is to determine the impact of the transverse 1.5 T magnetic field on the dose deposition. Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition kernel in the presence of 1.5 T. This kernel in turn was used to determine the dose deposition for larger fields. Also simulations and measurements were done in the presence of 1.1 T. The pencil beam dose deposition is asymmetric. For larger fields the asymmetry persists but decreases. For the latter the distance to dose maximum is reduced by approximately 5 mm, the penumbra is increased by approximately 1 mm, and the 50% isodose line is shifted approximately 1 mm. The dose deposition in the presence of 1.5 T is affected, but the effect can be taken into account in a conventional treatment planning procedure. The impact of the altered dose deposition for clinical IMRT treatments is the topic of further research	
427	4D MR imaging of respiratory organ motion and its variability	Algorithms, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional/mt [Methods], Liver/pa [Pathology], Lung/pa [Pathology], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Models,Statistical, Motion, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted, Research, Respiration, Retrospective Studies, Subtraction Technique, Switzerland	This paper describes a method for 4D imaging, which is used to study respiratory organ motion, a key problem in various treatments. Whilst the commonly used imaging methods rely on simplified breathing patterns to acquire one breathing cycle, the proposed method was developed to study irregularities in organ motion during free breathing over tens of minutes. The method does not assume a constant breathing depth or even strict periodicity and does not depend on an external respiratory signal. Time-resolved 3D image sequences were reconstructed by retrospective stacking of dynamic 2D images using internal image-based sorting. The generic method is demonstrated for the liver and for the lung. Quantitative evaluations of the volume consistency show the advantages over one-dimensional measurements for image sorting. Dense deformation fields describing the respiratory motion were estimated from the reconstructed volumes using non-rigid 3D registration. All obtained motion fields showed variations in the range of minutes such as drifts and deformations, which changed both the exhalation position of the liver and the breathing pattern. The obtained motion data are used in proton therapy planning to evaluate dose delivery methodologies with respect to their motion sensitivity. Besides this application, the new possibilities of studying respiratory motion are valuable for other applications such as the evaluation of gating techniques with respect to residual motion

This is a further development aimed at the use of the phase space evolution model in radiotherapy treatment planning. The model presented uses an improved method to control the evolution of the phase space state. This new method results in a faster algorithm, and requires less computer memory. An extra advantage of this method is that it allows the pre-calculation of information, further reducing calculation times. Typical results obtainable with this model are illustrated with the cases of (i) a 20 MeV pencil beam in a water phantom, (ii) a 20 MeV 5 x 5 cm2 beam in a water phantom containing two air cavities, and (iii) a 20 MeV 5 x 5 cm2 beam in a water phantom containing an aluminium region. The results of the dose distribution calculations are in good agreement with and require significantly less computation time than results obtained with Monte Carlo methods	
2530	Helium ion therapy for choroidal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye/re [Radiation Effects], Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Morbidity, Mortality, Radiation,Ionizing/tu [Therapeutic Use], Research, Visual Acuity	Eighty-two patients with choroidal melanomas were treated with helium ion charged particle irradiation. Seventy-eight of 82 patients have either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Forty-five of 46 patients followed for at least 1 year after therapy have demonstrated tumor regression with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 31%. No tumor-related mortality has been observed. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged particle external beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

3126	X-ray sources of medical linear accelerators: focal and extra-focal radiation	Biophysics, Canada, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Head, Humans, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted, Radiography, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, X-Rays	A computerized tomography (CT) reconstruction technique has been used to make quantitative measurements of the size and shape of the focal spot in medical linear accelerators. Using this technique, we have measured the focal spots in a total of nine accelerators, including (i) two Varian Clinac 2100c's, (ii) two Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) Therac-25's, (iii) two AECL Therac 6's, (iv) a Siemens KD-2, (v) a Varian Clinac 600c (4 MV), and (vi) an AECL Therac-20. Some of these focal spots were monitored for changes over a 2-yr period. It has been found that (i) the size and shape of the source spot varies greatly between accelerators of different design ranging from 0.5 to 3.4 mm in full width at half maximum (FWHM); and (ii) for accelerators of the same design, the focal spots are very similar. In addition to the measurements of the focal spot, a new technique for measuring the magnitude and distribution of extra-focal radiation originating from the linear accelerator head (flattening filter, primary collimator) has also been developed. The extra-focal radiation produced by a Varian Clinac 2100c accelerator was measured using this technique and it was found that the extra-focal radiation accounts for as much as 8% of the total photon fluence reaching the isocenter. The majority (75%) of this extra-focal radiation originates from within a circle 6 cm in diameter at the target plane. The source MTFs for each of the measured focal spots have been calculated in order to assess their influence on the spatial resolution of verification images. The limiting spatial resolution (i.e., 10% modulation) for all the source MTFs is 1.8 mm-1 or greater when used for transmission radiography at a magnification of 1.2. The extra-focal radiation, which produces a low-frequency drop in the source MTFs of up to 8%, changes with field size. As a result, the source MTFs of linear accelerators depend not only on the design of individual accelerators and image magnification, but also on the field size used when forming an image	
680	Chondromyxoid fibroma of the skull base: differential diagnosis and radiotherapy: two case reports and a review of the literature.

Involvement of the skull base is extremely rare. We describe two new cases of base of the skull chondromyxoid fibromas. The tumours were incompletely excised and irradiated with protons because of the high risk of complications of another surgical procedure. The rationale for proton therapy was based on the intimate relations between the tumour and the organs at risk. Skull base chondromyxoid fibroma is a very rare, slowly growing benign tumour that can cause severe disabilities due to tumour compression of critical structures. Only surgical resection has been shown to be relatively effective. We report two cases of incompletely excised lesions treated by postoperative high-dose radiation including proton therapy with no active disease and complication. Our review of the literature allows us to conclude that histological diagnosis of lesions in this site is a trap for pathologists and that radiotherapy is not contraindicated. [References: 45]	
795	Medium-mediated intercellular communication is involved in bystander responses of X-ray-irradiated normal human fibroblasts	Alpha Particles, Bystander Effect, Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Communication/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/cy [Cytology], Fibroblasts/de [Drug Effects], Fibroblasts/ph [Physiology], Gamma Rays, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Massachusetts, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Reference Values, Research, X-Rays	Although radiation-induced bystander effects have been demonstrated in a number of cell types, the studies have largely been performed using high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, such as alpha-particles. The literature is contradictory on whether fibroblasts show bystander responses, especially after low LET radiation such as X- or gamma-rays and whether the same signal transmission pathways are involved. Herein, a novel transwell insert culture dish method is used to show that X-irradiation induces medium-mediated bystander effects in AGO1522 normal human fibroblasts. The frequency of micronuclei formation in unirradiated bystander cells increases from a background of about 6.5% to about 9-13% at all doses from 0.1 to 10 Gy to the irradiated cells. Induction of p21Waf1 protein and foci of gamma-H2AX in bystander cells is also independent of dose to the irradiated cells above 0.1 Gy. In addition, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased persistently in directly irradiated cells up to 60 h after irradiation and in bystander cells for 30 h. Adding Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase to the medium decreases the formation of micronuclei and induction of p21Waf1 and gamma-H2AX foci in bystander cells, suggesting oxidative metabolism plays a role in the signaling pathways in bystander cells. The results of clonogenic assay of bystander cells showed that survival of bystander cells decreases from 0 to 0.5 Gy, and then is independent of the dose to irradiated cells from 0.5 to 10 Gy. Unlike the response with p21Waf1 expression, gamma-H2AX foci and micronuclei, adding SOD and catalase has no effect on the survival of bystander cells. The data suggest that irradiated cells release toxic factors other than ROS into the medium	
4463	Postmortem examination of 22 pancreatic carcinoma patients treated with helium ion irradiation	Adult, Aged, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], California, Californium, Carcinoma,Intraductal,Noninfiltrating/rt [Radiotherapy], Digestive System/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Helium, Humans, Ions, Kidney, Liver, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreas/re [Radiation Effects], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Safety, Skin, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Spinal Cord, Survival	Postmortem findings are available in this report in 22 patients with pancreatic carcinoma treated with helium ions at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory; California. This represents the largest group evaluated histologically in the literature and is the first report evaluating effects of particle radiation in pancreatic tissue. Patient survival after therapy averaged 9 months. Most died of infection and/or pulmonary emboli. Local control was achieved in 27%. The pancreatic tumors had histologically more severe radiation changes than nontumor bearing pancreas. Irradiated bone marrow was severely hypocellular, and irradiated skin was atrophic. Five patients had radiation injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal cord, liver, and kidneys showed no damage. This study demonstrates the safety of helium particle irradiation with present therapeutic planning. Injury to tumor was seen without excessive damage to adjacent tissues

Using Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FT-IRM), we investigated whether the experimental conditions used for cell recognition induce cellular changes prior to irradiation and compared biochemical changes and DNA damage after targeted and nontargeted irradiation with alpha particles delivered by macro- or microbeams, using gamma radiation as a reference. Molecular damage in single HaCaT cells was studied by means of FT-IRM and comet assay (Gault et al., Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 81, 767-779, 2005). Hoechst 33342-stained HaCaT cells were exposed to single doses of 2 Gy (239)Pu alpha particles from a broad-beam irradiator, five impacted alpha particles from a microbeam irradiator, or 6 Gy gamma rays from (137)Cs, each of which resulted in about 5% clonogenic survival. FT-IRM of control cells indicated that Hoechst binding to nuclear DNA induced subtle changes in DNA conformation, and its excitation under UV illumination induced a dramatic shift of the DNA conformation from A to B as well as major DNA damage as measured by the comet assay. Comparison of the FT-IRM spectra of cells exposed to gamma rays or alpha particles specifically targeted to the nucleus, alpha particles from a broad-beam irradiator revealed spectral changes corresponding to all changes in constitutive bases in nucleic acids, suggesting oxidative damage in these bases, as well as structural damage in the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone of DNA and the osidic structure of nucleic acids. Concomitantly, spectral changes specific to protein suggested structural modifications. Striking differences in IR spectra between targeted microbeam- and nontargeted macrobeam-irradiated cells indicated greater residual unrepaired or misrepaired damage after microbeam irradiation. This was confirmed by the comet assay data. These results show that FT-IRM, together with the comet assay, is useful for assessing direct radiation-induced damage to nucleic acids and proteins in single cells and for investigating the effects of radiation quality. Significantly, FT-IRM revealed that Hoechst 33342 binding to DNA and exposure to UV light induce a dramatic change in DNA conformation as well as DNA damage. These findings suggest that fluorochrome staining should be avoided in studies of ionizing radiation-induced bystander effects based on charged-particle microbeam irradiation. An alternative cell nucleus recognition system that avoids nuclear matrix damage and its possible contribution to propagation of biological effects from irradiated cells to neighboring nontargeted cells needs to be developed	
1445	Intensity modulated arc deliveries approximated by a large number of fixed gantry position sliding window dynamic multileaf collimator fields	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Time, Time Factors	The intensity modulated arc has been proposed as an alternative to tomotherapy. Treatment planing systems more typically model the conventional step and shoot or sliding window dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) deliveries, and may not support intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT). As well, another potential drawback to this technique is that increasing the number of intensity levels required to achieve certain dose distributions necessitates increasing the number of gantry passes, as may occur if the desired dose distribution is complex (e.g., concave or bifurcated), potentially increasing the overall treatment time. A technique is presented here for the delivery of tomotherapy like dose distributions in a single gantry pass by the use of a large number of fields modulated by a sliding window DMLC technique from fixed equally spaced gantry positions. This serves as a good approximation to either IMAT or tomotherapy deliveries. The planning of these fields is achieved using iterative filtered back projection. Measured results of deliveries of varying degrees of complexity on a homogeneous phantom are compared to desired distributions

4712	Use of peripheral dose data from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation fields to estimate out-of-field organ dose in patients treated employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy	Head, Humans, India, Indium, Jaw, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Scattering,Radiation, Time, Water, Whole-Body Counting, X-Rays	Peripheral doses (PD) from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) fields were measured for 6 MV x-rays on a Varian linear accelerator using a 0.6 cc ionization chamber inserted at 5 cm depth into a 35 x 35 x 105 cm3 plastic water phantom. PD measurements were also carried out under identical conditions for seven patients treated for head and neck and cervical cancer employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The measured PD from these patient-specific intensity-modulated beams (IMBs) were compared with the corresponding data from uniform DMLC fields having similar jaws setting. The measured PD per monitor unit (PD/MU) decreases almost exponentially with out-of-field distance for all uniform DMLC and static fields. For the same strip field width of 1.2 cm, uniform DMLC fields with a larger size of 14 x 22 cm2 deliver an average of 3.51 (SD = 0.51) times higher PD/MU at all out-of-field distances compared to 6 x 6 cm2. Similar to uniform DMLC fields, PD/MU measured from different patient-specific IMBs was found to decrease almost exponentially with out-of-field distance and increase with increase in field dimension. PD per MU from uniform DMLC fields and patient-specific IMBs having similar jaws setting shows good agreement (+/-7%) except at the most proximal distance, where a variation of more than 10% (maximum 15%) was observed. Our study shows that PD data generated from uniform DMLC fields can be used as baseline data to estimate out-of-field critical organ or whole-body dose in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT if an appropriate correction factor for field dimension is applied. The whole-body dose information can be used to estimate the possible increase in risk of fatal secondary malignancy in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT

The ESR response as a function of proton (E = 105 MeV) dose to bone was linear from 0 to 50 Gy and similar to the photon (E = 6 MV) dose response. The ESR depth response (Bragg) curve was depressed as compared to a depth-response curve determined with a parallel plate ionization chamber (PPIC). There was a short-term ESR signal fade in the Bragg peak region, likely attributable to the organic component in bone. We are continuing to investigate these latter two effects

It has various unique biological activities and has been shown to be a useful fluorescent dye specific for DNA and RNA, a pH indicator, photosensitizer, antitumor and antimalarial drug, and detector of bacteria and parasites. It has recently been found that AO accumulates in musculoskeletal sarcomas and that after illumination of the tumors with visible light or irradiation with low-dose X-rays, the dye rapidly exerts selective cytocidal effect against the sarcoma cells. Therefore, surgery combined with photo- (PDT) or radiodynamic therapy (RDT) with AO (AO-PDT and -RDT) has been applied to human musculoskeletal sarcomas. The results of a clinical study on the outcome of this therapeutic strategy revealed that it yielded better local control and remarkably better limb function than wide resectional surgery. Based on our experimental studies, it was clarified that AO accumulates in acidic organelles or structures, especially lysosomes, depending on the acidity. An enormous number of protons are produced in cancer from lactate or CO2 under hypoxic conditions, which are moved into the extracellular fluid or lysosomes to maintain the intracellularfluid pH. Therefore, AO shows marked accumulation in the acidic lysosomes of cancer cells. Photon energy from visible light or X-rays excites the AO accumulated in lysosomes; the excited AO emits fluorescence and forms activated oxygen from intra-cytoplasmic oxygen. The activated oxygen destroys lysosomes, with the released lysosomal enzymes causing rapid death of the cancer cells. On the other hand, normal cells can exclude AO quickly because they are not acidic. Thus, AO-PDT and AO-RDT exhibit strong and selective cytocidal effect against malignant tumors. In conclusion, we believe that AO-PDT and AO-RDT exhibit selective anticancer cell activity and that AO excited by photon energy has excellent potential as an anticancer agent

The morphology of peripheral blood remained essentially unaltered, when test subjects were given dehydrated diets (freshly prepared, stored for 2 years and exposed to proton irradiation of a dose of 24,000 rad) or Salyut-6 space diet. Stress effects brought about neutrophil leukocytosis and lymphopenia which could be prevented with dietary supplements	
3728	Radiation therapy for arteriovenous malformations: a review.[see comment]. [Review] [65 refs]	Boston, Brain, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Massachusetts, Mortality, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Recurrence, Research	There have been numerous case reports and series of patients treated with partial brain irradiation, linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and Bragg peak therapy for inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These cases are summarized and compared. There is convincing evidence that radiation therapy does have a role in obliterating carefully chosen inoperable lesions. The changes that occur in vessel walls after radiation are reviewed. Data about x-ray and gamma radiation are mostly historical and difficult to evaluate because of the techniques of partial brain irradiation. There is a lack of data about the volume of AVM treated and the minimum dose delivered to the AVM nidus. For gamma knife, heavy particle, and linear accelerator therapy, more complete data are available. The incidence of hemorrhage during the first 2 years after treatment, when radiation-induced vascular changes are proposed to occur, is approximately 2.6% per year for gamma knife therapy, 2% per year for proton beam therapy, 2.3% per year for helium beam therapy, and 2.3% per year for linear accelerator therapy. These rates are similar to the recurrence rate for hemorrhage of 2.2 to 3% per year expected based on the natural history of untreated AVMs. If AVM obliteration after therapy is not achieved, the incidence of recurrent hemorrhage remains between 2% per year after treatment with gamma knife therapy. The incidence of hemorrhage for all patients treated was reported as 0.15% per year in one study and 20% over 8 years in a follow-up study using proton beam therapy. Mortality from hemorrhage after treatment was 0.6% after gamma knife therapy, 2.3% after helium beam therapy, and 2 to 5% after proton beam therapy. These figures for mortality are all lower than the 11% observed for the natural history of untreated AVMs. Permanent neurological deficits experienced as a complication of radiation occurred in 2 to 3% of patients treated with gamma knife therapy, 4% of patients treated with helium beam therapy, 1.7% of patients treated with proton beam therapy, and 3% of patients treated with stereotactic linear accelerator therapy. Proton beam therapy has been used for both small and large lesions. The majority of lesions in patients treated with gamma knife, helium beam, and linear accelerator therapy have been small (usually less than 3.0 cm average diameter) lesions. In these patients with small inoperable lesions treated with accurately directed fields of isocentric radiation, the greatest incidence of AVM obliteration has been observed on follow-up angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 65]	
4122	Physical aspects of external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma	Canada, Electrons, Humans, Lung, Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Pleural Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research	The optimization of radiotherapy for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma highlights many of the currently outstanding problems in clinical radiation physics. The experimental investigation of an intuitively attractive irradiation technique with combined photon and electron beams using a specially constructed phantom has established that, due to the penetration in low density material of both primary electrons and those secondary to photon irradiation, the normal lung tissue is not spared to any significant degree by such a technique. Furthermore, great care needs to be exercised in the treatment planning calculations for this approach if absolute dosimetry errors as large as 50% are to be avoided

In order to improve outcomes, we sought to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of sstr-targeted high-LET alpha-emitting (213)Bi to that of low-LET beta(-)-emitting (177)Lu by determining relative biological effectiveness (RBE) using the external gamma-beam of (137)Cs as reference radiation. METHODS: Sstr-expressing human pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-2 cells and A549 control cells were used for this study. The effects of different radiation doses of (213)Bi and (177)Lu labeled to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid and sstr-targeted DOTATOC were investigated with a clonogenic cell survival assay. Apoptosis was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISA(PLUS) 10x kit. RESULTS: Using equimolar DOTATOC treatment with concurrent irradiation with a (137)Cs source as reference radiation, the calculated RBE of [(213)Bi]DOTATOC was 3.4, as compared to 1.0 for [(177)Lu]DOTATOC. As measured in terms of absorbance units, [(213)Bi]DOTATOC caused a 2.3-fold-greater release of apoptosis-specific mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes than [(177)Lu]DOTATOC at the final treatment time of 96 h (P<.001) in sstr-expressing Capan-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, at the same absorbed dose, [(213)Bi]DOTATOC is therapeutically more effective in decreasing survival than is [(177)Lu]DOTATOC in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells due to its comparatively higher RBE

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 1997 to November 2000, 37 patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ions at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at GSI, Darmstadt. Tumor-conformal application of carbon beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning in combination with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. The treatment planning procedure included a biological plan optimization. We applied a cobalt-Gray equivalent dose of 60GyE. Acute toxicity was assessed according to the common toxicity criteria (CTC). RESULTS: Acute toxicity included skin reactions ( degrees I+ degrees II) in four patients, mucositis ( degrees I- degrees III) in eight patients, otitis and middle ear effusion in four, sinusitis in four, nausea/weight loss in one and edema of the temporal lobes in one patient. In two patients, preexisting neurological symptoms worsened. We did not observe acute morbidity > degrees III of normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Scanning beam delivery of heavy charged particles is safe and reliable. No unexpected acute dose limiting toxicity was observed. With regard to toxicity, a substantial improvement compared to passive beam shaping technology is achieved

2168	Secondary electron fluence perturbation by high-Z interfaces in clinical proton beams: a Monte Carlo study	Belgium, Electrons, Gold, Graphite, Humans, Mathematical Computing, Metals, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Software, Universities, Water	Fluence perturbation of secondary electrons from clinical proton beams (50-250 MeV) by thin high-Z planar interfaces was studied with Monte Carlo simulations. Starting from monoenergetic proton pencil beams, proton depth doses and proton fluence spectra were calculated, both in homogeneous water and near thin high-Z interfaces by using the proton transport Monte Carlo code PTRAN. This code was modified extensively to enable modelling of proton transport in non-homogeneous geometries. From the proton fluence spectra in water and in the interface materials, electron generation spectra were calculated analytically and were then used as input for an electron transport calculation with the Monte Carlo code EGS4/PRESTAII to obtain electron doses and electron fluence spectra. The interface materials used in the study were graphite, Al, Ti, Cu, Sn and Au. We found significant electron fluence perturbations on both sides of the planar interfaces, resulting in an electron dose increase upstream and a decrease downstream from the interfaces, with the magnitude of the effect depending strongly on the atomic number of the interface. For the most extreme case studied, 250 MeV protons and a gold interface, we obtained an electron dose increase of 41% upstream of the interface and a decrease of 15% downstream with both perturbations having a spatial extent of about 700 microm. The total dose perturbation due to this effect amounts to a 5% increase upstream and a 2% decrease downstream. A detailed analysis of dose and fluence perturbation is presented for a wide range of materials and proton energies	
526	Experimental determination of the effect of detector size on profile measurements in narrow photon beams	Air, Fourier Analysis, Gels, Humans, Ions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Normal Distribution, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Polymers/ch [Chemistry], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Software	The aim of this work is to investigate experimentally the detector size effect on narrow beam profile measurements. Polymer gel and magnetic resonance imaging dosimetry was used for this purpose. Profile measurements (Pm(s)) of a 5 mm diameter 6 MV stereotactic beam were performed using polymer gels. Eight measurements of the profile of this narrow beam were performed using correspondingly eight different detector sizes. This was achieved using high spatial resolution (0.25 mm) two-dimensional measurements and eight different signal integration volumes A X A X slice thickness, simulating detectors of different size. "A" ranged from 0.25 to 7.5 mm, representing the detector size. The gel-derived profiles exhibited increased penumbra width with increasing detector size, for sizes >0.5 mm. By extrapolating the gel-derived profiles to zero detector size, the true profile (Pt) of the studied beam was derived. The same polymer gel data were also used to simulate a small-volume ion chamber profile measurement of the same beam, in terms of volume averaging. The comparison between these results and actual corresponding small-volume chamber profile measurements performed in this study, reveal that the penumbra broadening caused by both volume averaging and electron transport alterations (present in actual ion chamber profile measurements) is a lot more intense than that resulted by volume averaging effects alone (present in gel-derived profiles simulating ion chamber profile measurements). Therefore, not only the detector size, but also its composition and tissue equivalency is proved to be an important factor for correct narrow beam profile measurements. Additionally, the convolution kernels related to each detector size and to the air ion chamber were calculated using the corresponding profile measurements (Pm(s)), the gel-derived true profile (Pt), and convolution theory. The response kernels of any desired detector can be derived, allowing the elimination of the errors associated with narrow beam profile measurements

In the present study, the type of interphase death occuring after administration of moderate and high doses of low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons was investigated. Lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with radiation doses of 5 and 20 gray (Gy) of both radiation qualities. They were cultured for 24 or 48 hours and the type of cell death induced was determined by electron microscopy. After neutron irradiation, a slight increase in the incidence of apoptosis from 5 to 20 Gy was found, whereas after gamma-irradiation, the incidence of apoptosis was lower at 20 Gy as compared to 5 Gy. However, unlike the other radiation doses, the 20 Gy dose of gamma-rays, besides apoptosis also induced oncosis (classical necrosis). According to our experiments, membranes are probably an important target for the induction of interphase death. It is suggested that a great amount of ionisations distributed all over the cell surface, as caused by high doses of gamma-rays, lead to a high influx of Ca++ which induces oncosis instead of apoptosis

The intention was a treatment procedure for routine clinical use and with high physical and mechanical reproducibility. The possibilities of using high energy electrons, supervoltage roentgen radiation, gamma emitting nuclides or fast neutrons in a technique for routine clinical use were investigated. The radiation of choice taking physical properties, radiation biologic factors and practical circumstances into account was considered to be 60-Co gamma radiation.

The MCRTV system consists of the EGS4/PRESTA MC codes originally written for particle transport through the accelerator, the multileaf collimator (MLC), and the patient/phantom, which run on a 28-CPU Linux cluster, and the associated software developed for the clinical implementation. MCRTV has an interface with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) (Eclipse, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and reads the information needed for MC computation transferred in DICOM-RT format. The key features of MCRTV have been presented in detail in this paper. The phase-space data of our 15 MV photon beam from a Varian Clinac 2300C/D have been developed and several benchmarks have been performed under homogeneous and several inhomogeneous conditions (including water, aluminium, lung and bone media). The MC results agreed with the ionization chamber measurements to within 1% and 2% for homogeneous and inhomogeneous conditions, respectively. The MC calculation for a clinical prostate IMRT treatment plan validated the implementation of the beams and the patient/phantom configuration in MCRTV	
3320	A comparison of biological effects of modulated carbon-ions and fast neutrons in human osteosarcoma cells	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cell Survival, DNA Repair, Fast Neutrons, Gamma Rays, Humans, Japan, Methods, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities, Water	PURPOSE: To compare the biological effects of a 135 MeV/u carbon-ion beam and 13 MeV fast neutron beam using human osteosarcoma cells. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We have studied the clonogenic cell survival, recovery of potentially lethal damage (PLD) in plateau phase cells, and spheroid cure in multicellular spheroid after irradiation at various positions in the plateau and spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) of a 135 MeV/u carbon-ion beam and with 13 MeV neutrons. The carbon beam had a 4-cm range in water and a range filter was used to produce a 3-cm extended-peak region. The reference radiation was 137Cs gamma-rays. RESULTS: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for 10% survival level of plateau phase cells for carbon-ions at the position of plateau, proximal peak, midpeak, and distal peak within the SOBP, and neutrons were 1.71, 2.48, 2.63, 3.47, and 2.29, respectively. Corresponding RBE values at 1% level were 1.64, 1.93, 2.06, 2.49, and 2.05. The extent of recovery from PLD was reduced after carbon-ions at proximal peak, midpeak, and distal peak, and neutrons, although not substantially reduced after carbon-ions at plateau. The RBE values for 50% spheroid cure level of spheroids for carbon-ions at the position of plateau, proximal peak, midproximal peak, middistal peak, and distal peak within the SOBP, and neutrons were 1.69, 1.88, 1.87, 1.94, 2.03, and 1.90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The biological parameters measured all indicate an approximately comparable biological effectiveness between 75-80 KeV/microns carbon-ions of the SOBP and 13 MeV neutrons in the human tumor model studied in vitro

The most favorable clinical results by fast neutron treatment had been revealed in such diseases as follows; salivary gland tumors, prostate cancer, Pancoast type lung cancer, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma. The characteristics of these tumors as to the radiobiological properties and the dose distribution are, 1) relatively slow growing tumors and higher RBE for tumor tissue, and 2) capability of correct delivery of a big radiation doses to the target, without any severe radiation complications. Normal tissue tolerance (NSD formulas) for each tissues were also discussed

Non-targeted (bystander) effects may influence these cells' response to radiation and the investigation of these effects may therefore provide new insights into mechanisms of radiosensitivity and responses to radiotherapy as well as define new targets for therapeutic approaches. Normal primary human astrocytes (NHA) and T98G glioma cells were irradiated with helium ions using the Gray Cancer Institute microbeam facility targeting individual cells. Irradiated NHA and T98G glioma cells generated signals that induced gammaH2AX foci in neighbouring non-targeted bystander cells up to 48 h after irradiation. gammaH2AX bystander foci were also observed in co-cultures targeting either NHA or T98G cells and in medium transfer experiments. Dimethyl sulphoxide, Filipin and anti-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 could suppress gammaH2AX foci in bystander cells, confirming that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane-mediated signals are involved in the bystander signalling pathways. Also, TGF-beta 1 induced gammaH2AX in an ROS-dependent manner similar to bystander foci. ROS and membrane signalling-dependent differences in bystander foci induction between T98G glioma cells and normal human astrocytes have been observed. Inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein and DNA-PK could not suppress the induction of bystander gammaH2AX foci whereas the mutation of ATM- and rad3-related (ATR) abrogated bystander foci induction. Furthermore, ATR-dependent bystander foci induction was restricted to S-phase cells. These observations may provide additional therapeutic targets for the exploitation of the bystander effect	
1096	Simultaneous minimizing monitor units and number of segments without leaf end abutment for segmental intensity modulated radiation therapy delivery	Algorithms, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time Factors	Leaf end abutment is seldom studied when delivering segmental intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields. We developed an efficient leaf sequencing method to eliminate leaf end abutment for segmental IMRT delivery. Our method uses simple matrix and sorting operations to obtain a solution that simultaneously minimizes total monitor units and number of segments without leaf end abutment between segments. We implemented and demonstrated our method for multiple clinical cases. We compared the results of our method with the results from exhaustive search method. We found that our solution without leaf end abutment produced equivalent results to the unconstrained solutions in terms of minimum total monitor units and minimum number of leaf segments. We conclude that the leaf end abutment fields can be avoided without affecting the efficiency of segmental IMRT delivery. The major strength of our method is its simplicity and high computing speed. This potentially provides a useful means for generating segmental IMRT fields that require high spatial resolution or complex intensity distributions

[Review] [44 refs]	Consensus, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) requires the use of inverse treatment planning and nonuniform fluence beams delivered by a series of complex radiation portals. The quality assurance procedures for conventional three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) have been developed and are in worldwide clinical use, but the more complex nature of IMRT limits the application of much of the quality assurance (QA) procedures developed for IMRT. Although consensus has not yet been reached regarding which procedures will eventually become recommended by official organizations, the field is rapidly coming to agreement on a basic set of procedures. This manuscript describes some of the novel techniques recently developed for IMRT QA, both for the validation of the calculated dose distribution and for assuring that the dose distribution reaches its intended targets.

The biomedical effect of low doses is of chief importance in regard to use of radiation in radiodiagnosis and medicine, which account for most artificial radiation exposure in man. Interesting features are stochastic effects without a threshold dose, such as induction of cancer, mutation and developmental anomalies. 2. Optimization of radiotherapy: Apart from amelioration of temporal radiation distribution, possible modifiers are tested such as chemical substances (as sensitizers of tumor cells and protectors of healthy tissue) or hyperthermia. For selective irradiation of the tumor, various kinds of radiation are evaluated, e.g. pions, protons and heavy ions. 3. Public education and information	
3625	Dose rates and energy spectra in the maze of a linear accelerator treatment room.[see comment]	Algorithms, Facility Design and Construction, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation	When designing an entrance maze for a linear accelerator facility, it is useful to be able to estimate both the dose rate at the entrance and, in case further shielding is necessary, the energy spectrum of the scattered photons reaching the maze entrance. This study examines the applicability of the commonly used empirical formula contained in the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report No. 51 for estimating the dose rates at the maze entrance in a typical treatment room, and proposes an improvement allowing for the fact that the initial scattering event occurs most often in the patient at the isocentre. The X-ray energy spectrum at the maze entrance is also measured and shown to have a lower average energy than is assumed in NCRP Report No. 51	
4218	The potential for irradiation of the lens and cataract induction by incorporated alpha-emitting radionuclides	Alpha Particles, Animals, Cataract/et [Etiology], Dogs, Eye, Germany, Humans, Lens,Crystalline/me [Metabolism], Plutonium, Plutonium/ad [Administration & Dosage], Plutonium/me [Metabolism], Radiation, Radium, Radium/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radium/me [Metabolism]	Data on the uptake and retention of Ra and Pu in ocular tissues are reviewed. These data were used to calculate alpha radiation doses to the lens of the eye for patients injected with 224Ra and for individuals exposed to one annual limit on intake (ALI) per year of 224Ra, 226Ra, 228Ra and 239Pu for a period of 50 y. On the basis of this analysis, it is concluded that the induction of lens opacity should not be the factor limiting intake of any radioisotope of Pu or for 224Ra or 226Ra. However, for 228Ra the dose lies within the range of doses received by 224Ra patients who have developed cataracts	
3929	A new method for proton detection of H2(17)O with potential applications for functional MRI	Chemistry, Deuterium, Deuterium Oxide, Humans, Image Enhancement/mt [Methods], Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Isotopes, Israel, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Models,Structural, Oxygen, Oxygen Isotopes, Protons, Science, Serum Albumin, Time, Universities, Water, Water/du [Diagnostic Use]	A method is presented for the sensitive detection of minute amounts of H2(17)O. The method is based on the increase of the T2 of the water protons following an irradiation of the 17O resonance frequency, due to the partial or full decoupling of the 1H-17O spin-spin interaction. It is demonstrated that when 17O concentrations are low, full decoupling is achieved, and at short echo times the increase in the amplitude of the proton echo signal is proportional to the 17O content of the sample. The potential of the method for indirect 17O imaging is substantiated by a simple one dimensional projection of cylindrical phantoms containing various 17O concentrations. Using interleaved sequences with and without 17O decoupling, errors due to time dependent effects are minimized	
442	Depth absorbed dose and LET distributions of therapeutic 1H, 4He, 7Li, and 12C beams	Body Burden, Computer Simulation, Electrons, Helium, Humans, Ions, Ions/an [Analysis], Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Linear Energy Transfer, Linear Energy Transfer/ph [Physiology], Models,Biological, Photons, Physics, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Risk, Scattering,Radiation, Water	The depth absorbed dose and LET (linear energy transfer) distribution of different ions of clinical interest such as 1H, 4He, 7Li, and 12C ions have been investigated using the Monte Carlo code SHIELD-HIT. The energies of the projectiles correspond to ranges in water and soft tissue of approximately 260 mm. The depth dose distributions of the primary particles and their secondaries have been calculated and separated with regard to their low and high LET components. A LET value below 10 eV/nm can generally be regarded as low LET and sparsely ionizing like electrons and photons. The high LET region may be assumed to start at 20 eV/nm where on average two double-strand breaks can be formed when crossing the periphery of a nucleosome, even though strictly speaking the LET limits are not sharp and ought to vary with the charge and mass of the ion. At the Bragg peak of a monoenergetic high energy proton beam, less than 3% of the total absorbed dose is comprised of high LET components above 20 eV/nm. The high LET contribution to the total absorbed dose in the Bragg peak is significantly larger with increasing ion charge as a natural result of higher stopping power and lower range straggling. The fact that the range straggling and multiple scattering are reduced by half from hydrogen to helium increases the possibility to accurately deposit only the high LET component in the tumor with negligible dose to organs at risk. Therefore, the lateral penumbra is significantly improved and the higher dose gradients of 7Li and 12C ions both longitudinally and laterally will be of major advantage in biological optimized radiation therapy. With increasing charge of the ion, the high LET absorbed dose in the beam entrance and the plateau regions where healthy normal tissues are generally located is also increased. The dose distribution of the high LET components in the 7Li beam is only located around the Bragg peak, characterized by a Gaussian-type distribution. Furthermore, the secondary particles produced by high energy 7Li ions in tissuelike media have mainly low LET character both in front of and beyond the Bragg peak

1295	Visual verification of linac light and radiation fields coincidence	Humans, Italy, Light, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photometry, Physics, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiosurgery, Reproducibility of Results, Scattering,Radiation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Visual Perception	X-ray and light field alignment evaluation is carried out during linac quality assurance programs. In this paper, we compare the size of the light field measured by a photodiode and by a more traditional visual observation with the size of the x-ray field. The comparison between actual light field size, measured with the photodiode, and light field size measured by human eye allow us to verify the reliability of human eye in the evaluation of this parameter. The visual field is always larger than real light field; however, it agrees better with the x-ray field. It matches the light field if we take into account the 25% (+/- 1%) of the decrement line of the maximum central lightening; however, this method simulates better the actual field employed in radiation treatments	
3066	The evaluation of nylon and polyethylene as build-up material in a neutron therapy beam	Humans, Hydrogen, Models,Structural, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Nylons, Polyethylene, Polyethylenes, Pressure, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, South Africa	In high-energy neutron beams a substantial amount of build-up material is required to irradiate biological samples under conditions of charged particle equilibrium. Ideally A-150 tissue-equivalent plastic is used for this purpose. This material is however not always readily available and hence the need for a substitute compound. The selected hydrocarbon should satisfy two requirements: the quality of the radiation on the distal side needs to be the same as that measured for A-150 plastic and the absorbed dose should remain consistent. A tissue-equivalent proportional counter operating at reduced pressure not only measures the absorbed dose accurately but provides a means for assessing the nature of a radiation field in terms of a secondary charged particle spectrum. Using build-up caps manufactured from nylon (type 6) and polyethylene, it is shown that the former is an acceptable substitute for A-150 plastic. The data further demonstrate that both the absorbed dose and the spectral character of the measured single-event distribution are altered when polyethylene is used and that these discrepancies are attributable to the higher hydrogen content of polyethylene

The system components are a stereotactic fixation system that can be used each treatment day, a localization, and positioning unit that can be used during x-ray computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and radiographical examinations as well as for treatment. Conformal precision radiotherapy is planned with a new three-dimensional treatment planning system (Voxel-Plan-Heidelberg) which comprises, among others options, a three-dimensional image correlation procedure as well as routines for the calculation of coplanar and non-coplanar irradiations with irregularly shaped fields. Two different multi-leaf collimators have been designed for precision radiotherapy in the head and neck region. A manual multi-leaf collimator is used for irradiations with stationary beams or for moving beam treatments with invariable irregularly shaped fields. This collimator system is now being used for patient treatments. The design of a computer controlled multi-leaf collimator unit for multiple fixed field irradiation techniques is discussed. All system components are aimed at conforming dose distributions for fractionated radiotherapy treatments to the target to improve sparing of adjacent normal tissues, and at achieving a sufficient geometrical accuracy in the dose application

This article concentrates on some of the dosimetric aspects affecting the potential success of RIT, and examines factors which influence the choice of a radiolabel for RIT. No radionuclide is likely to give an optimum tumor/nontumor insult for all tumor types; therefore, the concept of matching the source to tumor morphology is introduced. Lists of candidate radionuclides are given, classified according to the type of decay, range, and energy of the emission. The article examines how the choice of radionuclide for radiolabeling the antibody affects the local energy deposition in the tumor. Both the effect of tumor size on the energy absorbed fraction and the problem of antibody binding heterogeneity are discussed. The approach to RIT is to relate the choice of radionuclide to the physical properties of the tumor. [References: 26]

Results of the first 42 treated tumors in 31 patients are presented. Most of the patients had solitary tumors in liver, lung or retroperitoneal space. Clinical target volumes ranged from 2 to 622 cm3 (mean 78 cm3) and minimum doses to the planning target volumes (PTV) of 7.7-30 Gy/fraction (mean 14.2 Gy) were given on 1-4 occasions to a total minimum dose to the PTVs of 7.7-45 Gy (mean 30.2 Gy) to the periphery of the PTV and total mean doses to the PTVs of 8-66 Gy (mean 41 Gy). The central part of the tumor was usually given about 50% higher dose compared to that of the periphery of the PTV by a planned inhomogeneous dose distribution. Some of the patients received stereotactic radiation therapy concomitantly to more than one target, in others new metastases were also treated which appeared during the follow-up period. We observed a local rate of no progressive disease of 80% during a follow-up period of 1.5-38 months. Fifty percent of the tumors decreased in size or disappeared

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

In the present work the Monte Carlo Code MCNP was used to model a radiotherapy room and investigate the NCRP formula. The dose of the scattered photons was calculated for 6-MV and 10-MV x-rays for the following situations: primary beam in vacuum, primary beam with air in the room, collimated primary beam (by the jaws) with air in the room and primary beam collimated with air in the room, and phantom at 100-cm SSD. It was found that for 6-MV x-rays the dose, when these materials were present in the beam path, was 1.2, 1.6, 5.3, and 13.1 x 10(-22) Gy photon(-1), respectively. Therefore the presence of all these materials together increased the dose by a factor of 11. The dose due to leakage was calculated separately to be 9.1 x 10(-22) Gy photon(-1). This adds another factor of 8. The 10-MV results were similar to those at 6 MV. There was good agreement between MCNP calculations and the published measurements. The spectrum and average energy of scattered photons at different locations in the radiotherapy room and the maze were also calculated by MCNP

The operation of the facility was started in 1997 and the feasibility of the spot scanning technique has been demonstrated in practice with patient treatments. In this report we discuss the usual initial difficulties encountered in the commissioning of a new technology, the very positive preliminary experience with the system and the optimistic expectations for the future. The long range goal of this project is to parallel the recent developments regarding inverse planning for photons with a similar advanced technology optimized for a proton beam

4126	Measurement of total body nitrogen and oxygen by irradiation with cyclotron neutrons and 'delayed' gamma ray counting	Body Composition, Gamma Rays, Half-Life, Humans, Methods, Neutrons, Nitrogen, Nitrogen/an [Analysis], Oxygen, Oxygen/an [Analysis], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation]	Measurement of total body nitrogen is assuming increasing importance in the nutritional evaluation of seriously ill patients. Nitrogen has been previously measured either by counting (i) the annihilation radiation from 13N immediately after neutron irradiation with 14 MeV neutrons or (ii) the 'prompt' gamma rays from thermal neutron capture by 14N during irradiation with 14 MeV neutrons or with those produced by isotopic sources or a cyclotron. The present work describes studies into the feasibility of measuring 13N produced by irradiation with a neutron beam from the MRC Cyclotron. A complication of this method is that 13N is also produced in a reaction with 16O. Direct measurement of oxygen by use of the reactions 16O(n, p)16N or 16O(n, 2n)15O enables this interference to be estimated. The former reaction is possible with both 14 meV and cyclotron-produced neutrons but the 7.1 s half-life of 16N requires detectors to be placed in or very close to the irradiation site. In our particular circumstances this is not possible but the more energetic cyclotron neutron spectrum allows the production of 15O which has a half-life of 2.05 min and can be measured in a remote whole-body counter. A disadvantage with the cyclotron beam, in comparison with 14 MeV neutrons, is that a higher dose is required for similar accuracy. A reproducibility of about 4% is obtained with a dose equivalent of 0.01 Sv	
656	Radiation protectants: current status and future prospects.[see comment]	Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques, Dietary Supplements, Electromagnetic Fields, Gene Transfer,Horizontal, Genetic Engineering, Humans, Physics, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Protection, Radiation-Protective Agents, Radiation-Protective Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radiation-Protective Agents/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation-Protective Agents/pd [Pharmacology], Research, Time	In today's heightened nuclear/biological/chemical threat environment, there is an increased need to have safe and effective means to protect not only special high-risk service groups, but also the general population at large, from the health hazards of unintended ionizing radiation exposures. An unfulfilled dream has been to have a globally effective pharmacologic that could be easily taken orally without any undue side effects prior to a suspected or impending nuclear/radiological event; such an ideal radioprotective agent has yet to be identified, let alone fully developed and approved for human use. No one would argue against the fact that this is problematic and needs to be corrected, but where might the ultimate solution to this difficult problem be found? Without question, representative species of the aminothiol family [e.g., Amifostine (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, Maryland)] have proven to be potent cytoprotectants for normal tissues subjected to irradiation or to radiomimetic chemicals. Although Amifostine is currently used clinically, drug toxicity, limited times of protection, and unfavorable routes of administration, all serve to limit the drug's utility in nonclinical settings. A full range of research and development strategies is being employed currently in the hunt for new safe and effective radioprotectants. These include: (1) large scale screening of new chemical classes or natural products; (2) restructuring/reformulating older protectants with proven efficacies but unwanted toxicities; (3) using nutraceuticals that are only moderately protective but are essentially nontoxic; (4) using low dose combinations of potentially toxic but efficacious agents that protect through different routes to foster radioprotective synergy; and (5) accepting a lower level of drug efficacy in lieu of reduced toxicity, banking on the premise that the protection afforded can be leveraged by post-exposure therapies. Although it is difficult to predict which of these strategies will ultimately prove to be successful, it is certain that the probability of a useful protectant being fielded is increased significantly. This is due to the resurgence of interest in radiation protection, increased resources being expended by federal agencies, and by the Food and Drug Administration's willingness to innovate relative to new approval guidance	
2568	Beam profiles along the nonwedged direction for large wedged fields	Algorithms, Biophysics, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research	Beam profiles along the nonwedged direction of a wedged field produced by a linear accelerator exhibit more "sagging" than that of an open field at the same depth. For large fields, the profiles of open and wedged fields can differ by as much as 7%. The extra "sagging" of wedged profiles is mainly due to the difference in penetration between on- and off-axis rays caused by the variation of beam quality across the field. An algorithm was developed to estimate an "effective" depth such that the profile of a wedged field can be approximated by the open-field profile at the effective depth. The algorithm was verified by measured beam profiles for 6- and 15-MV x-ray beams for 15 degree, 30 degree, 45 degree, and 60 degree wedges	
2873	Observations on personnel dosimetry for radiotherapy personnel operating high-energy LINACs	Environment, Film Dosimetry/is [Instrumentation], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Technology,Radiologic/ma [Manpower], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/is [Instrumentation]	A series of measurements were conducted to determine the cause of a sudden increase in personnel radiation exposures. One objective of the measurements was to determine if the increases were related to changing from film dosimeters exchanged monthly to TLD-100 dosimeters exchanged quarterly. While small increases were observed in the dose equivalents of most employees, the dose equivalents of personnel operating medical electron linear accelerators with energies greater than 20 MV doubled coincidentally with the change in the personnel dosimeter program. The measurements indicated a small thermal neutron radiation component around the accelerators operated by these personnel. This component caused the doses measured with the TLD-100 dosimeters to be overstated. Therefore, the increase in these personnel dose equivalents was not due to changes in work habits or radiation environments. Either film or TLD-700 dosimeters would be suitable for personnel monitoring around high-energy linear accelerators. The final choice would depend on economics and personal preference

Measurements with activation detectors of differing energy response were used to unfold secondary particle spectra at various locations on the patient table. The effect of charged particles was estimated using a calculation of neutron-flux densities derived from published cross sections. The absorbed dose, as a function of distance from the beam axis, was calculated using the unfolded spectra and evaluated fluence-to-dose conversion factors. The values of absorbed dose obtained from the unfolding of experimental data agree with the values obtained from the calculated spectra within the estimated uncertainty of +/- 25%. These values are approximately 5 X 10(-3) rad on the beam axis and approximately 1 X 10(-3) rad at distances greater than 20 cm, perpendicular to the beam axis, per rad deposited by the incident alpha-particle beam in the plateau. Estimates of upper limits of dose to two critical organs, the lens of the eye and red bone marrow, are approximately 25 rad and approximately 5 rad, respectively, for a typical treatment plan

We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT	
2968	Verification of electron beam therapy with conventional and storage phosphor images: preliminary experience	Anatomy, Electrons, Humans, Luminescent Measurements, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Technology,Radiologic, Universities	Portal verification images were generated by the photon contamination in electron beams produced by a linear accelerator during treatment of patients receiving high-energy electron radiation therapy. Both conventional and storage phosphor methods yielded projection radiographs in which anatomy of the irradiated and surrounding tissue was demonstrated. Exposed phantoms were used to confirm that the images represent a true projection of the radiation field. A preliminary series of 22 cases was evaluated by two radiotherapists and judged subjectively to be of clinical value. Geometric error, or more importantly, the lack thereof, during high-energy electron treatments was easily confirmed with this method. In three cases, the treatment protocol was corrected based on the images obtained. Because the readout process of storage phosphor images allows for gain adjustments and post-processing, the images obtained with this method were found to delineate anatomy in the treated and surrounding tissues somewhat more consistently than could conventional images

Most published experience relates to the use of the gamma knife. In this report, the authors review the methods and results of linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery in 44 patients with acoustic neuromas who were treated between 1993 and 1997. METHODS: Computerized tomography scanning was selected as the stereotactic imaging modality for target definition. A single, conformally shaped isocenter was used in the treatment of 40 patients; two or three isocenters were used in four patients who harbored very irregular tumors. The radiation dose directed to the tumor border was the only parameter that changed during the study period: in the first 24 patients who were treated the dose was 15 to 20 Gy, whereas in the last 20 patients the dose was reduced to 11 to 14 Gy. After a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 12-60 months), 98% of the tumors were controlled. The actuarial hearing preservation rate was 71%. New transient facial neuropathy developed in 24% of the patients and persisted to a mild degree in 8%. Radiation dose correlated significantly with the incidence of cranial neuropathy, particularly in large tumors (> or = 4 cm3). CONCLUSIONS: Single-isocenter LINAC radiosurgery proved to be an effective treatment for acoustic neuromas in this series, with results that were comparable with those reported for gamma knife radiosurgery and multiple isocenters

MATERIALS AND METHODS: RERF-LC-AI lung squamous carcinoma cells were irradiated with carbon ions of either 13.3, 50 or 90keV/microm. Colony formation was used to determine cell survival. VEGF mRNA and protein of the irradiated cells were quantified by Northern blot analysis and ELISA assay, respectively. Genistein, Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor and H7, protein kinase C inhibitor, were used to inhibit VEGF mRNA expression. RESULTS: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon ions (13.3, 50 and 90keV/microm) was 1.10, 1.97 and 2.30, respectively, in terms of D10 values. Single doses of 15 Gy with either X-rays or carbon ions significantly induced VEGF mRNA expression at 16-24h after irradiation with a maximum induction of 2.81-fold. A significant increase was also observed in VEGF protein levels, detected in culture supernatant 24h after irradiation with 50 and 90keV/microm carbon ions. Neither mRNA nor protein induction showed a dependence on LET. The induction of VEGF mRNA by carbon-ion irradiation was completely inhibited by pretreating cells with genistein and H7, indicating that Src tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C on cell surface membranes is involved in the induction. CONCLUSION: Irradiation of lung carcinoma cells with carbon ions induced VEGF mRNA expression and increased protein levels. The induction was dose-dependent. Radiation-induced DNA damage and/or its repair may not be a prerequisite for the induction of VEGF mRNA

3480	Clinical considerations for neutron capture therapy of brain tumors. [Review] [10 refs]	Animals, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Clinical Protocols, England, Gamma Rays, Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Phenylalanine, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Scalp, Skull, United States	The radiotherapeutic management of primary brain tumors and metastatic melanoma in brain has had disappointing clinical results for many years. Although neutron capture therapy was tried in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, the results were not as hoped. However, with the newly developed capability to measure boron concentrations in blood and tissue both quickly and accurately, and with the advent of epithermal neutron beams obviating the need for scalp and skull reflection, it should now be possible to mount such a clinical trial of NCT again and avoid serious complications. As a prerequisite, it will be important to demonstrate the differential uptake of boron compound in brain tumor as compared with normal brain and its blood supply. If this can be done, then a trial of boron neutron capture therapy for brain tumors should be feasible. Because boronated phenylalanine has been demonstrated to be preferentially taken up by melanoma cells through the biosynthetic pathway for melanin, there is special interest in a trial of boron neutron capture therapy for metastatic melanoma in brain. Again, the use of an epithermal beam would make this a practical possibility. However, because any epithermal (or thermal) beam must contain a certain contaminating level of gamma rays, and because even a pure neutron beam causes gamma rays to be generated when it interacts with tissue, we think that it is essential to deliver treatments with an epithermal beam for boron neutron capture therapy in fractions in order to minimize the late-effects of low-LET gamma rays in the normal tissue. I look forward to the remainder of this Workshop, which will detail recent progress in the development of epithermal, as well as thermal, beams and new methods for tracking and measuring the uptake of boron in normal and tumor tissues.

4035	Current status of radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.[see comment]. [Review] [20 refs]	Brain, Canada, Cobalt, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Risk, Risk Factors, Rotation, Universities	Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), regardless of the mode of discovery, have an annual risk of hemorrhage of approximately 4 percent. A progressive obliterative vasculitis culminating in the occlusion of an AVM may be induced by the administration of radiation doses of approximately 20 Gy given in a single fraction. The process takes about two years and occlusion occurs in approximately 80% of patients so treated. Such a dose may be accurately administered to AVMs up to 3 cm in diameter with very little radiation imparted to the adjacent brain by means of multiple highly collimated radially arranged cobalt sources (the Gamma Knife) or by means of a modified linear accelerator turned through an arc or arcs with the target AVM as the centre of rotation. The Gamma Knife and the modified linear accelerator have nearly equal accuracy. Recent experience with modified linear accelerators indicates efficacy equal to the Gamma Knife. Both devices are effective treatment for small AVMs but the cost of modifying a pre-existing linear accelerator is only a few percent of the acquisition and installation costs of the Gamma Knife.

2862	Characteristics of electron beams from a medical microtron	Acceleration, Electrons, Humans, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Water	The Instrument AB Scanditronix MM22 medical microtron provides ten electron beam energies from approximately 3 to 22 MeV. Isodose curves, depth dose curves, field uniformity, and other characteristics were measured in water and in polystyrene. The method of acceleration, dual scattering foil system, and collimation technique produce beams having features superior to many other medical electron accelerators. Maximum dose rates at isocenter varied from about 500 to over 900 cGy min-1, photon contamination from 0.6% to 4.1%, and surface doses from 70% to 95% of the maximum. Depth dose curves were indistinguishable from those with identical practical ranges of a scanned beam linac at energies less than 18 MeV, and field flatness was clearly superior to the scanned beam linac at standard treatment distances	
4447	Regression patterns of uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation	Adult, Aged, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/co [Complications], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Research, Retinal Detachment/co [Complications], Uveal Neoplasms/co [Complications], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Forty-four uveal melanomas were evaluated for patterns of tumor regression after proton beam irradiation. All tumors were followed for a minimum of ten months after treatment. Seven lesions completely disappeared, 33 have decreased in size, and 4 remained unchanged. Associated signs of tumor regression were: resolution of the secondary serous retinal detachments, central apical yellow discoloration of the tumor, destruction of the tumor's vasculature, and elimination of fluorescein leakage. This study demonstrated that regression after proton beam irradiation is a relatively slow process, and the effects of radiation could be observed in some cases more than a year after treatment

This recommendation is based on the dogma that the DNA of the nucleus is the main target for radiation-induced genotoxicity and, as fewer cells are directly damaged, the deleterious effects of radiation proportionally decline. In this paper, we used a precision microbeam to target an exact fraction (either 100% or < or =20%) of the cells in a confluent population and irradiated their nuclei with exactly one alpha particle each. We found that the frequencies of induced mutations and chromosomal changes in populations where some known fractions of nuclei were hit are consistent with non-hit cells contributing significantly to the response. In fact, irradiation of 10% of a confluent mammalian cell population with a single alpha particle per cell results in a mutant yield similar to that observed when all of the cells in the population are irradiated. This effect was significantly eliminated in cells pretreated with a 1 mM dose of octanol, which inhibits gap junction-mediated intercellular communication, or in cells carrying a dominant negative connexin 43 vector. The data imply that the relevant target for radiation mutagenesis is larger than an individual cell and suggest a need to reconsider the validity of the linear extrapolation in making risk estimates for low dose, high linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation exposure	
588	Investigating the accuracy of the FLUKA code for transport of therapeutic ion beams in matter	Carbon, Computer Simulation, Electromagnetic Fields, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Mathematics, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Positron-Emission Tomography/is [Instrumentation], Positron-Emission Tomography/mt [Methods], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Reproducibility of Results, Software, Water	In-beam positron emission tomography (PET) is currently used for monitoring the dose delivery at the heavy ion therapy facility at GSI Darmstadt. The method is based on the fact that carbon ions produce positron emitting isotopes in fragmentation reactions with the atomic nuclei of the tissue. The relation between dose and beta(+)-activity is not straightforward. Hence it is not possible to infer the delivered dose directly from the PET distribution. To overcome this problem and enable therapy monitoring, beta(+)-distributions are simulated on the basis of the treatment plan and compared with the measured ones. Following the positive clinical impact, it is planned to apply the method at future ion therapy facilities, where beams from protons up to oxygen nuclei will be available. A simulation code capable of handling all these ions and predicting the irradiation-induced beta(+)-activity distributions is desirable. An established and general purpose radiation transport code is preferred. FLUKA is a candidate for such a code. For application to in-beam PET therapy monitoring, the code has to model with high accuracy both the electromagnetic and nuclear interactions responsible for dose deposition and beta(+)-activity production, respectively. In this work, the electromagnetic interaction in FLUKA was adjusted to reproduce the same particle range as from the experimentally validated treatment planning software TRiP, used at GSI. Furthermore, projectile fragmentation spectra in water targets have been studied in comparison to available experimental data. Finally, cross sections for the production of the most abundant fragments have been calculated and compared to values found in the literature	
292	Imaging doses from the Elekta Synergy X-ray cone beam CT system	Equipment Design, Equipment Safety, Head, Head/ra [Radiography], Humans, Lung/ra [Radiography], Male, Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Prostate/ra [Radiography], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation]	The Elekta Synergy is a radiotherapy treatment machine with integrated kilovoltage (kV) X-ray imaging system capable of producing cone beam CT (CBCT) images of the patient in the treatment position. The aim of this study is to assess the additional imaging dose. Cone beam CT dose index (CBDI) is introduced and measured inside standard CTDI phantoms for several sites (head: 100 kV, 38 mAs, lung: 120 kV, 152 mAs and pelvis: 130 kV, 456 mAs). The measured weighted doses were compared with thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements at various locations in a Rando phantom and at patients' surfaces. The measured CBDIs in-air at the isocentre were 9.2 mGy 100 mAs(-1), 7.3 mGy 100 mAs(-1) and 5.3 mGy 100 mAs(-1) for 130 kV, 120 kV and 100 kV, respectively. The body phantom weighted CBDI were 5.5 mGy 100 mAs(-1) and 3.8 mGy 100 mAs(-1 )for 130 kV and 120 kV. The head phantom weighted CBDI was 4.3 mGy 100 mAs(-1) for 100 kV. The weighted doses for the Christie Hospital CBCT imaging techniques were 1.6 mGy, 6 mGy and 22 mGy for the head, lung and pelvis. The measured CBDIs were used to estimate the total effective dose for the Synergy system using the ImPACT CT Patient Dosimetry Calculator. Measured CBCT doses using the Christie Hospital protocols are low for head and lung scans whether compared with electronic portal imaging (EPI), commonly used for treatment verification, or single and multiple slice CT. For the pelvis, doses are similar to EPI but higher than CT. Repeated use of CBCT for treatment verification is likely and hence the total patient dose needs to be carefully considered. It is important to consider further development of low dose CBCT techniques to keep additional doses as low as reasonably practicable

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In June 1999, the Society ordered an analysis of the state of radiation oncology. It created a survey that was sent to all radiotherapy units in Spain. A database was created in which 230 variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-four centers were analyzed, and 157 external beam irradiation, megavoltage units were counted, of which 67 were cobalt units and 90 were linear accelerators. The cobalt units worked an average of 11.4 h daily and the linear accelerators 11.6 h. The number of patients/unit/y was 472 for the cobalt units and 442 for the linear accelerators. The number of patients by physician and year was 179. Each center received a mean of 958 new patients annually. The average between the reception and start of treatment was 25.52 days (maximum 60), and it was estimated that only 38.1% of cancers were irradiated. The number of radiation oncologists working was 392. Spain has a deficit of 297 radiation oncologists. CONCLUSION: There is a need for 44 MV units and for the replacement of 67 cobalt units. The present lack of units has had an impact on palliative treatment, which has resulted in pharmacy costs. As long as these instrumental deficiencies are not solved, waiting lists will continue to be inherent to the system. There are also important staff deficiencies, in that about 297 radiation oncologists would be needed to cover the needs

948	Three-dimensional conformal setup (3D-CSU) of patients using the coordinate system provided by three internal fiducial markers and two orthogonal diagnostic X-ray systems in the treatment room	Fluoroscopy, Gold, Head, Humans, Japan, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Rotation	PURPOSE: To test the accuracy of a system for correcting for the rotational error of the clinical target volume (CTV) without having to reposition the patient using three fiducial markers and two orthogonal fluoroscopic images. We call this system "three-dimensional conformal setup" (3D-CSU). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three 2.0-mm gold markers are inserted into or adjacent to the CTV. On the treatment couch, the actual positions of the three markers are calculated based on two orthogonal fluoroscopies crossing at the isocenter of the linear accelerator. Discrepancy of the actual coordinates of gravity center of three markers from its planned coordinates is calculated. Translational setup error is corrected by adjustment of the treatment couch. The rotation angles (alpha, beta, gamma) of the coordinates of the actual CTV relative to the planned CTV are calculated around the lateral (x), craniocaudal (y), and anteroposterior (z) axes of the planned CTV. The angles of the gantry head, collimator, and treatment couch of the linear accelerator are adjusted according to the rotation of the actual coordinates of the tumor in relation to the planned coordinates. We have measured the accuracy of 3D-CSU using a static cubic phantom. RESULTS: The gravity center of the phantom was corrected within 0.9 +/- 0.3 mm (mean +/- SD), 0.4 +/- 0.2 mm, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm for the rotation of the phantom from 0-30 degrees around the x, y, and z axes, respectively, every 5 degrees. Dose distribution was shown to be consistent with the planned dose distribution every 10 degrees of the rotation from 0-30 degrees. The mean rotational error after 3D-CSU was -0.4 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SD), -0.2 +/- 0.4, and 0.0 +/- 0.5 degrees around the x, y, and z axis, respectively, for the rotation from 0-90 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Phantom studies showed that 3D-CSU is useful for performing rotational correction of the target volume without correcting the position of the patient on the treatment couch. The 3D-CSU will be clinically useful for tumors in structures such as paraspinal diseases and prostate cancers not subject to large internal organ motion	
1054	Neutron dose from prostheses material during radiotherapy with protons and photons	Alloys, Alloys/ch [Chemistry], Humans, Materials Testing, Neutron Activation Analysis, Neutrons, Photons, Physics, Prostheses and Implants/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Switzerland, Titanium, Titanium/ch [Chemistry]	The purpose of this investigation is to measure the impact of Ti-alloy-prostheses on the neutron dose during proton and photon radiotherapy. Such unwanted neutron dose to the patient should be kept as low as possible (ALARA principle), as such additional dose can create secondary malignancies. For this purpose we performed neutron dose measurements using etch track detectors under the same conditions on a proton and a photon beam line used for radiotherapy. We found no influence of the prostheses material on the neutron dose both for proton and photon treatment	
1674	Biophysical modelling of proton radiation effects based on amorphous track models	Algorithms, Animals, Boston, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Massachusetts, Models,Biological, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival	PURPOSE: To define a photon-equivalent dose in charged particle therapy one needs to know the RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness) in the target region as well as in the surrounding tissue. RBE estimates are difficult since both the physical input parameters, i.e. LET distributions, and, even more so, the biological input parameters, i.e. cell nucleus size and local response, are not known in general. Track structure theory provides a basis for predicting dose-response curves for particle irradiation. There are (at least) two somewhat different algorithms: the Amorphous Track Partition model (ATP) and the Amorphous Track Local effect model (ATL). Both have been reported to give good agreement with observed radiobiological data. We were interested in a general comparison and in the predictive power of these models for protons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the principles of the two track structure approaches. The general dependencies of the model predictions on the input parameters are investigated. The model predictions for protons with respect to cell survival of V79 cells are compared with measurements. RESULTS: Although based on similar assumptions, the application of track structure theory in terms of the computational procedure is different for the two models. The ATP model provides a set of equations to predict inter- and intratrack radiation response whereas the ATL model is based on Monte Carlo simulations. One conceptual difference is the use of average doses in subtargets in the ATP model compared with the use of local doses in infinitesimal compartments in the ATL model. The ATP concept introduces an empirical scaling of the cross-section from subcellular to cellular response. The ATL concept inherently requires a critical adjustment of parameters handling the high local dose region near the track centre. The models predict proton survival curves reasonably well but neither shows good agreement with experimental data over the entire range of proton energy and absorbed dose considered. CONCLUSION: Designed for heavy ion applications, the models show weaknesses in the prediction of proton radiation effects. Amorphous track models are based on assumptions about the properties of the biological target and the radiation field that can be questioned. In particular, the assumption of subtargets and the multitarget/single-hit response function on one hand and the parameterization of radial dose and high dose cellular response on the other hand leave question marks

Here we show, using a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP), that mitochondria-dependent apoptotic stimuli (such as Bax, staurosporine and ultraviolet irradiation) induce rapid, Bcl-2-inhibitable mitochondrial alkalinization and cytosol acidification, followed by cytC release, caspase activation and mitochondrial swelling and depolarization. These events are not induced by mitochondria-independent apoptotic stimuli, such as Fas. Activation of cytosolic caspases by cytC in vitro is minimal at neutral pH, but maximal at acidic pH, indicating that mitochondria-induced acidification of the cytosol may be important for caspase activation; this finding is supported by results obtained from cells using protonophores. Cytosol acidification and cytC release are suppressed by oligomycin, a FoF1-ATPase/H +-pump inhibitor, but not by caspase inhibitors. Ectopic expression of Bax in wild-type, but not FoF1/H+-pump-deficient, yeast cells similarly results in mitochondrial matrix alkalinization, cytosol acidification and cell death. These findings indicate that mitochondria-mediated alteration of intracellular pH may be an early event that regulates caspase activation in the mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis

These physical interactions and their effect on the resulting radiation field within matter are described within the context of a recently developed deterministic, coupled neutron-proton space radiation transport computer code (BRYNTRN). Using this computer code, estimates of human exposure in interplanetary space, behind nominal (2 g/cm2) and storm shelter (20 g/cm2) thicknesses of aluminum shielding, are made for the large solar proton event of August 1972. Included in these calculations are estimates of cumulative exposures to the skin, ocular lens, and bone marrow as a function of time during the event. Risk assessment in terms of absorbed dose and dose equivalent is discussed for these organs. Also presented are estimates of organ exposures for hypothetical, worst-case flare scenarios. The rate of dose equivalent accumulation places this situation in an interesting region of dose rate between the very low values of usual concern in terrestrial radiation environments and the high dose rate values prevalent in radiation therapy

3779	Beam optics design of compact gantry for proton therapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Optics, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Switzerland	A new proton therapy facility for the treatment of deep-seated tumours is being assembled. The proton beam will be applied to the patient under computer control, using dynamic scanning of a focused proton pencil beam to produce a complete three-dimensional conformation of the dose to the target volume. The beam will be applied to the supine patient using a compact isocentric gantry for protons. By combining the scanning of the beam with the beam optics and by mounting the patient couch eccentrically on the gantry, the diameter of the rotating structure can be reduced to 4 m, which is the smallest diameter designed so far for a proton gantry.

The radiolabeled estrogen/ER complex irradiates the cell nucleus by binding specific DNA sequences called estrogen response elements (EREs). Cell clonogenicity and induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by gamma radiation or accumulation of (125)I-iododeoxyuridine ((125)IdU) or E-17alpha[(125)I]iodovinyl-11betamethoxyestradiol ((125)IVME2) decays were determined. MCF-7 cells were efficiently killed by accumulation of (125)IdU (D(0) = 30 decays per cell) and (125)IVME2 decays (D(0) = 28 decays per cell). DNA DSBs were induced by the accumulation of (125)IdU (approximately 3750 decays per cell required to reduce the mean value of the elution profile to 50%) or (125)IVME2 decays (approximately 465 decays per cell required to reduce the mean value to 50%). For survival of MCF-7 cells after gamma irradiation, the D(0) was 1 Gy, and approximately 65 Gy was required to reduce the mean value to 50% for induction of DSBs. The RBE values for cell killing and induction of DSBs by (125)IVME2 relative to gamma radiation were 4.8 and 18.8, respectively. The RBE values for cell killing and induction of DSBs by (125)IdU relative to gamma radiation were 4.5 and 2.3, respectively. Cell killing in a manner similar to that induced by high-LET radiation and the high RBE for induction of DSBs by (125)IVME2 in the ER-expressing MCF-7 cells provide a biological rationale for the use of Auger electron-emitting radionuclides covalently bound to estrogen to deliver a cytotoxic dose of radiation to ER-positive cancers	
1853	Radiation effects in spheroids of cells exposed to alpha emitters	Alpha Particles, Animals, Astatine, Bismuth, Cell Count, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Models,Biological, Monte Carlo Method, Physics, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Spheroids,Cellular/cy [Cytology], Spheroids,Cellular/re [Radiation Effects], Survival, Universities	PURPOSE: To simulate spheroids of cells and use the spheroid models to establish methods of calculating cell survival following exposure to alpha irradiation from decays of 211At and 213Bi. METHODS: Using a Monte Carlo technique, two models of spheroids of cells were generated in which cells either did not or were allowed to overlap. At 40% packing of the volume it is shown that the two models are equivalent for longer-ranged alpha particles. The overlapping model was used to examine the effects of spheroid size and cell packing on cell survival. Cell survival was also calculated for different distributions of alpha decays such as uniform distribution within the spheroid, external to the spheroid and as a shell on the periphery of the spheroid. RESULTS: Three examples of the cell structure of the spheroids are shown. Detailed calculations show that cell survival decreases from 57% to 37% as the spheroid diameter increases from 75 microm to 225 microm for an average of one 211At decay per cell and 50% packing. Increasing the packing of the cells in the spheroid from 40% to 70% reduces survival from 46% to 26% for 200 microm diameter spheroids for one 211At or 213Bi decay per cell. The presence of small regions of unlabelled cells within the spheroids does not significantly change cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: Monte Carlo programmes generating spheroids of cells and their subsequent use to score cell survival for alpha irradiation should be useful in the design and interpretation of work on spheroids of cells in vitro and the application of such modelling to the study of very small tumours in vivo.

We havefound it necessary to 1) obtain an accurate three-dimensional determination of the treatment volume including the density of all tissues in the beam path; 2) construct an adequate bolus to compensate for tissue heterogeneities; 3) use much more precise and accurate immobilization and patient positioning devices than used in photon irradiation; 4) treat with both protons and photons so as to keep the skin dose within an acceptable level. IN TISSUES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT INHOMOGENETIES DUE TO BONE AND AIR SPACES WE HAVE DELIVEREDA WELL-DEFINED DOSE TO INVOLVED TISSUES WHILE SPARING DISTAL SENSITIVE STRUCTURES. However, in those regions where there is much "fine structure" of tissue density, it has been difficult to compensate satisfactorily for the inhomogeneties	
1573	Radioactivity appearing at landfills in household trash of nuclear medicine patients: much ado about nothing?	Health Physics, Humans, Medical Waste Disposal, Nuclear Medicine, Physics, Radiation, Radioactive Waste, Radioactivity, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Safety, Waste Management	The U.S. NRC in 1997 removed its arbitrary 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) rule, which had been in existence for almost 50 y, and now many more patients receiving radionuclide therapy in nuclear medicine can be treated as outpatients. However, another problem has the potential to limit the short-lived reality of outpatient treatment unless nuclear medicine practitioners and the health physics community gets involved. Radioactive articles in the household trash of nuclear medicine patients are appearing at solid waste landfills that have installed radiation monitors to prevent the entry of any detectable radioactivity, and alarms are going off around the country. These monitors are set to alarm at extremely low activity levels. Some states may actually hold licensees responsible if a patient's radioactive household trash is discovered in a solid waste stream; this is another major reason [along with continued use of the 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) rule] why many licensees are still not releasing their radionuclide therapy patients. This is in spite of the fact that the radioactivity contained in released nuclear medicine therapy patients, let alone the much lower activity level contained in their potentially radioactive household wastes, poses a minimal hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. Currently, there are no regulations governing the disposal of low-activity, rapidly-decaying radioactive materials found in the household trash of nuclear medicine patients, the performance of landfill radiation monitors, or the necessity of spectrometry equipment. Resources are, therefore, being unnecessarily expended by regulators and licensees in responding to radiation monitor alarms that are caused by these unregulated short-lived materials that may be mixed with municipal trash. Recommendations are presented that would have the effect of modifying the existing landfill regulations and practices so as to allow the immediate disposal of such wastes	
2877	Calibration of 192Ir high-dose-rate afterloading systems	Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/is [Instrumentation], Brachytherapy/st [Standards], Calibration, Electrons, Humans, Iridium Radioisotopes, Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Radioisotopes, Universities, X-Rays	A method is described for calibration of 192Ir high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy afterloading systems. Since NIST does not offer calibration of ionization chambers with the gamma-ray spectrum of iridium-192, an interpolation procedure is employed, using calibrations above (137Cs, 662 keV) and below (250 kVcp, 146-keV x rays) the exposure-weighted average 192Ir energy of 397 keV. The same total wall + cap thickness must be used for both calibrations, and for the 192Ir measurements. A wall + cap thickness of 0.3 g/cm2 is recommended to assure charged particle equilibrium and to exclude secondary electrons emitted from the source encapsulation. Procedures are described for determining the corrections for source-chamber distance and room scatter during the source calibration in inverse-square-law geometry. A new well-type ionization chamber has been designed specifically for convenient routine use with the HDR afterloading system. It can be calibrated by means of a previously calibrated 192Ir source, and offers a simple means for verifying the decay rate and for calibrating 192Ir replacement sources	
655	Evaluation of treatment-induced cerebral white matter injury by using diffusion-tensor MR imaging: initial experience	Adult, Aged, Anisotropy, Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/ae [Adverse Effects], Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/an [Analysis], Brain Chemistry, Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Brain/de [Drug Effects], Brain/pa [Pathology], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Creatine/an [Analysis], Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Time	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for brain tumors can cause white matter (WM) injury. Conventional MR imaging, however, cannot always depict treatment-induced transient WM abnormalities. We investigated the ability of diffusion-tensor (DT) MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy to detect the treatment-induced transient changes within normal-appearing WM. METHODS: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed in 8 patients treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for brain tumors (17 examinations) and 11 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, fractional anisotropy (FA) value, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio were obtained from 27 hemispheres with normal-appearing WM in the patients. We divided the datasets of isotropic ADC, FA, and NAA/Cr, on the basis of the time period after completion of radiation therapy, into 4 groups: group 1 (0-2 months; n = 10), group 2 (3-5 months; n = 5), group 3 (6-9 months; n = 7), and group 4 (10-12 months; n = 5). We compared averages of mean isotropic ADC, mean FA, and NAA/Cr of each patient group with those of the control group by using a t test. RESULTS: In the group 2, averages of mean FA and NAA/Cr decreased and average of mean isotopic ADC increased in comparison with those of the control group (P = .004, .04, and .0085, respectively). There were no significant differences in the averages between the control group and patient groups 1, 3, and 4. CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy can provide quantitative indices that may reflect treatment-induced transient derangement of normal-appearing WM	
2857	Medulloblastoma: long-term follow-up of patients treated with electron irradiation of the spinal field	Adolescent, Adult, Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Canada, Cerebellar Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Electrons, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, London, Male, Medulloblastoma/mo [Mortality], Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Spine/re [Radiation Effects], Survival, Survival Rate	Thirty-two patients with posterior fossa medulloblastoma underwent treatment with electron irradiation to the spinal field. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient). Complications following treatment with electrons to a spinal field are compared with reported complications following treatment with photons to the spinal field. Although short-term reactions were minimal, the authors found no difference in late complications. More sophisticated treatment planning may show such a long-term benefit in the future	
1827	Radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastases in renal cell carcinoma. [Review] [36 refs]	Bone Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Bone Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/su [Surgery], Germany, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Lead, Melanoma, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	BACKGROUND: In the treatment of brain metastases using a stereotactically modified linear accelerator it could be shown that a single dose between 15 and 25 Gy leads to partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from melanoma and hypernephroma. Radiosurgery of brain metastases then started in centers all over the world, however, experiences with brain metastases of renal cell carcinoma are yet limited. The aim of this analysis is therefore to present the treatment results of radiosurgery of brain metastases. Furthermore, in this paper prognostic subgroups shall be defined, in order to establish guidelines for an optimal therapy strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiosurgery means stereotactically guided high-precision irradiation methods by extremely focussing ionizing radiation within the target volume as a single dose application. The characteristic steep dose decrease allows the selective destruction of small intracranial lesions, while the surrounding brain tissue is optimally protected. Two methods, Gamma Knife and stereotactic modified linear accelerator are clinically available. RESULTS: In larger studies from different groups all over the world, local tumor control rates from 85% to 95%, recurrence rates from 6% to 15% and side effects between 3% and 15% have been attained, independent of the system used. Prognostic factors, like volume of metastases < 10 ml, applied dose > 18 Gy, one or two metastases, absence of extracranial metastases, good patient performance with a Karnofsky score > 70%, primary treatment and more than one year between primary diagnosis and brain metastases showed a trend toward improved survival. Depending on the prognostic factors the median survival after radiosurgery ranged from 6 to 12 months. Retrospective comparison of radiosurgery and surgical series suggest that both modalities attain similar results. The dose can be applied with an accuracy of 0.3 mm. DISCUSSION: Based on these experiences, brain metastases can be treated by radiosurgery, primarily in patients with one or two metastases or in combination with whole brain irradiation as a boost in patients with more than two metastases. Furthermore with radiosurgery a new treatment modality exists to re-irradiate patients who have been failed after surgery or whole brain irradiation. [References: 36]

Functional imaging of tumor metabolism can help with this task, but the choice of tracer is still controversial. This prospective study following up irradiated low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) was, to our knowledge, the first receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis that intraindividually evaluated the diagnostic performance of the SPECT tracers 3-[(123)I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT) and (99m)Tc(I)-hexakis(2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile) (MIBI) and the PET tracer (18)F-FDG. METHODS: We examined 17 patients, initially with histologically proven LGA and treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, who presented with new gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhancing lesions (n = 26) on MRI. At that time, MRI could not differentiate between progressive tumor and nonprogressive tumor. This MRI examination was closely followed by (18)F-FDG PET and by (99m)Tc-MIBI and (123)I-IMT SPECT. Lesions were classified as progressive tumor (n = 17) or nonprogressive tumor (n = 9) on the basis of prospective follow-up (through clinical examination, MRI, and proton MR spectroscopy) for 26.6 +/- 6.6 mo after PET or SPECT. RESULTS: (123)I-IMT yielded the best ROC characteristics and was the most accurate for classification, with an area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.991. The A(z) of (18)F-FDG (0.947) was not significantly lower than that of (123)I-IMT. The difference in the A(z) of (99m)Tc-MIBI (0.713) from the A(z) of the other tracers used in our study was highly significant (P </= 0.01). (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of low accuracy and, especially, of poor sensitivity even at modest specificity values. CONCLUSION: (123)I-IMT SPECT imaging of amino acid transport accurately detects tumor progression in patients with irradiated LGA. In contrast to (123)I-IMT, (18)F-FDG PET was slightly less accurate for classification, and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of limited value. Imaging of amino acid transport with (123)I-IMT is a valuable additional tool for the follow-up of LGA, allowing early, noninvasive differentiation of lesions with ambiguous morphology after irradiation	
1114	Radiation characteristics of helical tomotherapy	Electrons, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Safety, Sensitivity and Specificity, Software, Tomography/mt [Methods]	Helical tomotherapy is a dedicated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) system with on-board imaging capability (MVCT) and therefore differs from conventional treatment units. Different design goals resulted in some distinctive radiation field characteristics. The most significant differences in the design are the lack of flattening filter, increased shielding of the collimators, treatment and imaging operation modes and narrow fan beam delivery. Radiation characteristics of the helical tomotherapy system, sensitivity studies of various incident electron beam parameters and radiation safety analyses are presented here. It was determined that the photon beam energy spectrum of helical tomotherapy is similar to that of more conventional radiation treatment units. The two operational modes of the system result in different nominal energies of the incident electron beam with approximately 6 MeV and 3.5 MeV in the treatment and imaging modes, respectively. The off-axis mean energy dependence is much lower than in conventional radiotherapy units with less than 5% variation across the field, which is the consequence of the absent flattening filter. For the same reason the transverse profile exhibits the characteristic conical shape resulting in a 2-fold increase of the beam intensity in the center. The radiation leakage outside the field was found to be negligible at less than 0.05% because of the increased shielding of the collimators. At this level the in-field scattering is a dominant source of the radiation outside the field and thus a narrow field treatment does not result in the increased leakage. The sensitivity studies showed increased sensitivity on the incident electron position because of the narrow fan beam delivery and high sensitivity on the incident electron energy, as common to other treatment systems. All in all, it was determined that helical tomotherapy is a system with some unique radiation characteristics, which have been to a large extent optimized for intensity modulated delivery

The review consists of a brief introduction to the definition, role and clinical significance of portal imaging, along with a discussion of radiotherapy film systems and the motivations for EPIDs. This is followed by a summary of the challenges and constraints inherent to portal imaging along with a concise, historical review of the technologies that have been explored and developed. The paper then examines, in greater depth, the two first-generation technologies that have found widespread clinical use starting from the late 1980s. This is followed by a broad overview of the physics, operation, properties and advantages of active matrix, flat-panel, megavoltage imagers, presently being commercially introduced to clinical environments or expected to be introduced in the future. Finally, a survey of contemporary research efforts focused on improving portal imaging performance by addressing various weaknesses in existing commercial systems is presented. [References: 125]

1583	Late normal tissue sequelae in the second decade after high dose radiation therapy with combined photons and conformal protons for locally advanced prostate cancer	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cobalt, Follow-Up Studies, Hematuria/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Risk, Time, Time Factors	PURPOSE: We determined the long-term normal tissue effects of 77.4 Gy. delivered to the prostate in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1976 and 1992, 167 men with stages T3 to 4 prostate cancer were treated on protocol with 50.4 Gy. photons at 1.8 Gy. per fraction using a 4-field box arrangement, followed by a conformal perineal proton boost of 27 Gy. (cobalt Gy. equivalent) in 11 fractions. The chart was reviewed and 39 of the 42 surviving patients were interviewed. Median followup was 13.1 years (range 7 to 23). Normal tissue morbidity was recorded using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and the late effects normal tissue scale. RESULTS: The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater genitourinary morbidity was 59% at 15 years. However, these grade 2 or greater problems persisted to the time of the interview in only 7 of 39 cases. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater hematuria was 21% at 5 years and 47% at 15. For grade 3 or greater hematuria the risk was 3% and 8% at 5 and 15 years, respectively. No patient required cystectomy but 1 required diversion for morbidity. Urethral stricture and urinary incontinence with pads needed developed in 4 and 3 men, respectively. This particular morbidity was strongly associated with previous or subsequent prostate surgery. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal morbidity was 13% at 5 and 15 years, while grade 1 rectal bleeding occurred in another 41%. CONCLUSIONS: High dose conformal radiation to the prostate is followed by a high rate of low grade rectal bleeding but a low rate of grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal morbidity. This rate is stable and does not increase beyond 5 years. Genitourinary morbidity continues to develop well into the second decade after treatment, although high grade morbidity is uncommon. These findings do not suggest that the modern trend toward high dose prostate treatment with conformal techniques will result in a high incidence of serious and permanent late sequelae but it appears that hematuria will be common	
4220	Clinical value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for differentiating recurrent or residual brain tumor from delayed cerebral necrosis	Adolescent, Biopsy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Diagnostic Imaging, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm,Residual, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity	PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral necrosis (DN) is a significant risk for brain tumor patients treated with high-dose irradiation. Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

A group of 31 patients treated with iridium was opposed to a historical control group of 24 patients treated with radium. Both groups were submitted to the same method of simultaneous percutaneous irradiation. All consecutively treated patients exposed to a percutaneous focal dose of greater than 45 Gy were evaluated. The iridium and radium doses applied as well as the values measured in intestine and bladder are presented. The iridium group had the same or a slightly less favorable prognosis (prognostic factors compared: stage, percutaneous dose, histology, age) than the radium group. The remission rates were identical for both therapy methods. Patients treated with iridium have a slightly better curve of recurrence-free interval and survival time, even taking into consideration the shorter observation period. Two out of the patients treated with iridium and four out of those treated with radium presented severe long-term side effects with formation of fistulas (average incidence 12,5 months and 12,7 months after the beginning of therapy, respectively)

[German]	Aged, Electrons, Humans, Male, Neoplasms,Hormone-Dependent/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Testis, Testosterone/bl [Blood]	Irradiation of the tests of 11 patients with carcinoma of the prostate in the age from 68 to 78 years with 20 Gy (5 X 2 Gy per week) decreased the plasma testosterone levels to an average of 70,3% of the initial values. After operative orchidectomy, however, a decrease of the plasma testosterone level to only 5% the values before operation was observed. Therefore, the operative orchidectomy cannot be replaced by the irradiation of the testes. Higher irradiation doses may cause skin injuries and there is the possibility of being a real carcinogen noxe for the irradiation region too	
3130	Depth dose characteristics of 24-MV x-ray beams at extended SSD	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Universities	Depth dose characteristics of 24-MV beams from a medical linear accelerator at various SSDs have been measured. The dose buildup, percent depth dose (PDD), and output were measured using ionization chambers and a diode detector under full scatter. Surface dose ranged from 8% to 51% depending upon the collimator setting at 100-cm SSD. It decreased by 10%-15% as distance was increased to 200 cm, but remained unchanged beyond this distance. The dmax migrated rapidly toward the surface with increasing field size at 100-cm SSD. At extended SSD, the dmax occurred at greater depths and shifted a little toward the shallow depths with increasing field size. Large field PDDs measured at extended SSD agreed well with those predicted from 100-cm data. The output followed the 1/(distance)2 relationship quite well. The extended SSD beam data are clinically useful when treating hemibody or performing total body irradiation (TBI) procedures

[Russian]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Neoplasm Staging, Patients, Pituitary Gland,Anterior/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Dosage, Research, Stress,Psychological/th [Therapy], Survival, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	Clinically proved "alternative breast-preserving method" applicable for patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer. These patients refuse to go in to surgery or have indications for surgery (183 patients--T(1-4)N(0-3)M(0-1)). This method consists of the combination of the traditional method of the whole breast and/or nodal photon irradiation with local highly concentrated proton irradiation in the dosage iso-equivalent to tumor (proton with energy from 130 to 180 MeV, with stop in the target in notice depth). We used the irradiation of the adenohypophysis with narrow proton beams energy 200 MeV. The aim of the first combination of the components is the selectively influence on the target and the channeling to the tumor and its subclinical substances the dosages sufficient for the total irradiation of tumor with sparing surrounding tissues and parts of body. The goal of irradiation of adenohypophysis with protons is the normalization of its hormonal activity and elimination of factors stimulating growth of tumor cells in case of dishormonal cancer. The suggested method didu't only improve the results of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, but also contributed to the reducing of the emotional stress. We received high results of the patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer of criteria: local control rate (96%), long remission (more then 40%) and 5-year actuarial survival rate (83%). The patients examined during 5 and 18 years. It made a good cosmetic effect and high quality life of the patients with breast cancer	
973	Recombination chambers filled with different gases--studies of possible application for BNCT beam dosimetry	Algorithms, Body Burden, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Computer-Aided Design, Energy Transfer, Equipment Design, Equipment Failure Analysis/mt [Methods], Fast Neutrons, Feasibility Studies, Gases, Gases/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Nitrogen, Poland, Radiation, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Sensitivity and Specificity	Recombination microdosimetric method (RMM), based on the phenomenon of initial recombination of ions is applied to determine the distribution of the absorbed dose versus linear energy transfer (LET). Usually, the recombination chambers used for RMM are filled with tissue-equivalent gas, but the response of the device can be adjusted to the actual needs by the use of different gases. Using a graphite chamber filled with nitrogen and 10BF3 it was shown that RMM can also be used with chambers containing these gases. This opens the possibility of designing a recombination chamber for the determination of the dose fractions due to gamma radiation, fast neutrons, neutron capture on nitrogen and high-LET particles from the (n,10B) reaction in simulated tissue with different contents of 10B. It was also necessary to improve the method for the determination of initial recombination at low polarising voltages, when volume-recombination and back-diffusion of ions are considerably high	
3370	A comparison of proton and megavoltage X-ray treatment planning for prostate cancer	Humans, Male, Patient Selection, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectum, Research, X-Ray Therapy	Conformal photon and proton therapy plans for prostate cancer have been compared in an attempt to quantify the potential advantages of using protons. Two X-ray plans (3-field, 6-field) and a 2-field proton plan were made and compared for each of 20 T3 prostate patients with the aid of the 3D planning system VOXELPLAN. Dose distributions were analysed in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVH). Tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were computed using our own and the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models, respectively. The study shows that on average the proton technique results in the best dose distribution, giving the lowest rectal complication probability, and also that the 3-field X-ray technique is more effective than the 6-field X-ray technique in sparing the rectum. At 5% rectal NTCP, the predicted proton average TCP for the 20 patients is 2% (in absolute terms) greater than that obtained using 3-field X-ray therapy. For 7 of the patients the gain in TCP is more than 3%. For the same rectal NTCP as the 3-field X-ray plan with a 64 Gy mean target dose, the use of protons increases the TCP by 2% on average, but for 5 of the patients the increases are greater than 4%. The result is in general positive towards the use of protons but a few patients do not benefit from it and this indicates the importance of patient selection for maximum clinical benefit	
2647	Proton nuclear Overhauser effect investigation of the heme pockets in ligated hemoglobin: conformational differences between oxy and carbonmonoxy forms	Adult, Carboxyhemoglobin/me [Metabolism], Diffusion, Heme/an [Analysis], Hemoglobin A/me [Metabolism], Hemoglobins/me [Metabolism], Histidine, Humans, Ligands, Macromolecular Substances, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Molecular Weight, Oxyhemoglobins/me [Metabolism], Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Research, Time, Valine	Proton nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements have been used extensively to investigate the detailed conformations of peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids in the solution state. However, much of the published work has dealth with molecules of molecular weight less than 15 000. It is generally thought that specific NOEs cannot be observed in larger molecules (due to spin diffusion), so that NOE is of little use in conformational studies of such systems. By use of truncated-driven NOE with an irradiation time of 100 ms, specific NOEs are observed in a protein of the size of human normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A, 65 000 daltons). This technique has permitted us to assign several proton proton resonances arising from heme groups and from amino acid residues situated in the vicinity of the ligand binding site (such as E7 histidine and E11 valine) of the alpha and beta chains of Hb A. In addition, two-dimensional 1H[1H] J-correlated spectroscopy (COSY) experiments as well as theoretical ring-current calculations have confirmed the spectral assignments obtained by the one-dimensional NOE experiments. These new results not only have permitted us to map the heme pockets and to investigate the conformational differences in the heme pockets between oxy and carbonmonoxy forms of Hb A but also have demonstrated that the technique of truncated-driven NOE can be used to investigate the detailed conformations of selected regions in larger macromolecules in a way heretofore thought not to be feasible

The dilemma of whether to treat by primary irradiation or by conservative surgery is not yet solved. In this study, 67 patients were treated between 1967 and 1987 for anterior commissure carcinoma of the larynx. Radiation was used with 47 patients and conservation surgery with 20 patients. Initial lesion control was achieved with 72% of the patients treated by primary irradiation. Conservation surgery, when used as a primary treatment modality, achieved local control in 90% of the patients. The new techniques of reconstruction of the larynx enhance the surgeon's ability, strengthen his conviction to proceed to enlarged partial laryngectomies, and thus improve the oncologic control of the anterior commissure carcinoma as well

Actinium-225, with a half-life of 10 days and a yield of 4 alpha particles in its decay chain, may be an ideal choice for tumor-targeted radioimmunotherapy. Release of daughter radioisotopes from the primary chelator after the first decay has been a complication with the use of 225Ac. It has been reported that the domain-deleted product of MAb CC49, Hu-delta CH2 CC49, is able to extravasate and penetrate more deeply into tumors than the parent IgG molecule. We reasoned that once the 225Ac-chelate-MAb had penetrated into the tumor, the daughter radioisotopes would remain trapped even if they had been released from the primary chelator. Actinium-225 HEHA MAb CC49 conjugates were tested for distribution, micro-distribution and therapy in immunocompromised mice which had LS174T tumors growing at subcutaneous or intramuscular sites. Both 125I and 225Ac CC49 and Hu-delta CH2 CC49 were efficient in delivery of the radioisotopes to tumor sites. Tissue micro-autoradiography for the two antibody forms did not demonstrate any differences in micro-distribution of either 125I or 225Ac in the tumor. Furthermore, there was no detectable difference for the two carriers in the tumor retention of daughter radioisotopes from 225Ac. Therapy experiments with 225Ac were complicated by radiotoxicity of the conjugates. The lethal dose was about 0.5 microCi in two strains of mice regardless of the carrier. At injected doses of 0.5 and 0.25 microCi, CC49 was slightly active in tumor stasis, whereas no consistent significant effect of 225Ac-Hu-delta CH2 CC49 on growth of tumors was observed. The potential of 225Ac in radioimmunotherapy is limited by the radiotoxicity of its daughter radioisotopes. Its potential will only be realized if stable conjugates, capable of daughter radioisotope retention, can be devised	
3550	Proton therapy for pediatric cranial tumors: preliminary report on treatment and disease-related morbidities	Adolescent, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/co [Complications], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Medical Records, Methods, Morbidity, Physical Examination, Pituitary Neoplasms/co [Complications], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Seizures/et [Etiology], Universities	PURPOSE: Accelerated protons were used in an attempt to limit treatment-related morbidity in children with tumors in or near the developing brain, by reducing the integral dose to adjacent normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children treated with protons at Loma Linda University Medical Center between August 1991 and December 1994 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight children, aged 1 to 18 years, were identified as at risk for brain injury from treatment. Medical records, physical examinations, and correspondence with patients, their parents, and referring physicians were analyzed. The investigators tabulated post-treatment changes in pre-treatment signs and symptoms and made judgments as to whether improvement, no change, or worsening related to disease or treatment had supervened. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with clinical findings and radiographic impressions were tabulated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 7 to 49 months (median 25 months). Four instances of treatment-related morbidity were identified. Forty-one instances of site-specific, disease-related morbidity were identified: 15 improved or resolved and 26 remained unchanged after treatment. Four patients had radiographic evidence of local failure. Three of these patients, including two with high-grade glioma, have died. CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related morbidity associated with proton therapy is low. Tumor progression remains a problem when treating certain histologies such as high-grade glioma. Escalating the dose delivered to target volumes may benefit children with tumors associated with poor rates of local control. Long-term follow-up, including neurocognitive testing, is in progress to assess integral-dose effects on cognitive, behavioral and developmental outcomes in children with cranial tumors	
2549	Effects of field size on the survival of pig epidermal colony-forming in situ after electron irradiation.[see comment]	Animals, Carbon, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Colony-Forming Units Assay, Coloring Agents, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons, Humans, Male, Mice, Particle Accelerators, Research, Skin, Skin/cy [Cytology], Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Species Specificity, Staining and Labeling, Survival, Swine, Time, Universities	The survival of colony-forming cells in pig epidermis after irradiation was measured using different electron field sizes. The sensitivity of the colony-forming cells was characterized by D(o) = 2.5-3.0 Gy. There was an effect of field size, described approximately by: Dose (to give five colonies/cm2) (Gy) = (31 +/- 2) x Area-(0.048 +/- 0.015). The effect of field size was less than found previously using tolerance to skin reactions (area exponent = 0.16). This work indicates for the first time that the effects of different large field sizes in skin can be detected at the level of colony-forming cell survival	
3474	Radiation physics for particle beam radiosurgery. [Review] [40 refs]	Biophysics, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], California, Californium, Carbon, Energy Transfer, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Ions, Neon, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Universities	For the particles and energies considered suitable for radiosurgery, with increasing particle charge, the Bragg peak height reaches a maximum with helium and then decreases, the Bragg peak width narrows, the distal fall-off steepens, and the exit dose increases (Table 1). The helium-ion beam is superior to a proton beam because of the higher peak-plateau ratio, more rapid dose fall-off, and smaller beam deflection, and it suffers only in the modest exit dose. Comparison of the therapeutically useful parameters of these beams is complicated by the change in beam quality (LET) with depth. Considerations of RBE values, which change with the ion species and with depth of penetration, may alter the relative rankings based on one or more of these beam characterization values. For all these beams, the RBE increases with increasing LET. The effect for protons is small and occurs just at the end of range of the particles. Effective isodose distributions based on modeled beams have been reported for helium, carbon, and neon ions. These distributions include the effects of a varying RBE with changes in the beam quality (as measured by a dose-weighted LET) and the change in dose fraction size with depth (the dose per fraction is a function of the depth of penetration). These calculations suggest that the optimal charged-particle beam for radiosurgery might be carbon. Heavy charged-particle beams can produce dose distributions superior to those obtainable with photon or electron beams. In clinical trials, these dose distributions have proved to be useful for the treatment of human diseases, including neoplasia and life-threatening intracranial disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 40]	
274	Image-based modeling reveals dynamic redistribution of DNA damage into nuclear sub-domains	Cell Nucleus/me [Metabolism], Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Nucleus/ul [Ultrastructure], Computer Simulation, DNA Damage, DNA Damage/ph [Physiology], DNA Repair/ph [Physiology], DNA Repair/re [Radiation Effects], DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/ph [Physiology], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], DNA/ul [Ultrastructure], Epithelial Cells/ph [Physiology], Epithelial Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Biological, Probability, Research, United States	Several proteins involved in the response to DNA double strand breaks (DSB) form microscopically visible nuclear domains, or foci, after exposure to ionizing radiation. Radiation-induced foci (RIF) are believed to be located where DNA damage occurs. To test this assumption, we analyzed the spatial distribution of 53BP1, phosphorylated ATM, and gammaH2AX RIF in cells irradiated with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and low LET. Since energy is randomly deposited along high-LET particle paths, RIF along these paths should also be randomly distributed. The probability to induce DSB can be derived from DNA fragment data measured experimentally by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We used this probability in Monte Carlo simulations to predict DSB locations in synthetic nuclei geometrically described by a complete set of human chromosomes, taking into account microscope optics from real experiments. As expected, simulations produced DNA-weighted random (Poisson) distributions. In contrast, the distributions of RIF obtained as early as 5 min after exposure to high LET (1 GeV/amu Fe) were non-random. This deviation from the expected DNA-weighted random pattern can be further characterized by "relative DNA image measurements." This novel imaging approach shows that RIF were located preferentially at the interface between high and low DNA density regions, and were more frequent than predicted in regions with lower DNA density. The same preferential nuclear location was also measured for RIF induced by 1 Gy of low-LET radiation. This deviation from random behavior was evident only 5 min after irradiation for phosphorylated ATM RIF, while gammaH2AX and 53BP1 RIF showed pronounced deviations up to 30 min after exposure. These data suggest that DNA damage-induced foci are restricted to certain regions of the nucleus of human epithelial cells. It is possible that DNA lesions are collected in these nuclear sub-domains for more efficient repair

It is therefore desirable to minimize treatment time and hospitalisation. Aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility of a reduction of treatment time by accelerated fractionation. Out of 110 patients treated for glioblastoma from 1975 to 1988 in our institution postoperative radiation was performed in 79 patients using three different fractionation schedules: 60 Gy in six weeks, single fractions 2 Gy (n = 38), 35 Gy in two weeks, single fractions 3.5 Gy (n = 27), 45.5 Gy in 2.5 weeks, single fractions 3.5 Gy (n = 14). No statistically significant differences in both the mean overall and disease free survival were evaluated between the three groups. The larger fraction size was well tolerated and no relevant increase of early or late adverse reactions occurred. As the duration of treatment can be reduced from six to two weeks, this accelerated fractionation schedule seems to be a reasonable alternative to conventional fractionation	
403	Cell cycle-related bystander responses are not increased with LET after heavy-ion irradiation	Biophysics, Bystander Effect, Cell Cycle/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Differentiation, Cell Nucleus/me [Metabolism], Coculture Techniques, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/bi [Biosynthesis], DNA Damage, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Fibrosis, Flow Cytometry, Germany, Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Microscopy,Fluorescence, Research, X-Rays	Evidence has accumulated that irradiated cells affect their unirradiated neighbors, so that they in turn display cellular responses typically associated with direct radiation exposure. These responses are generally known as bystander effects. In this study, cell cycle-related bystander responses were investigated in three strains of human fibroblasts after exposure to densely ionizing radiation. Varying the linear energy transfer (LET) from 11 to 15,000 keV microm(-1) allowed a study of the impact of the complexity of DNA damage in the inducing cells on the responses of bystander cells. Using both broad-beam and microbeam irradiation, transient bystander responses were obtained for the induction of CDKN1A (p21). The latter was also observed when the transmission of bystander signals was limited to soluble factors. Targeted irradiation of single cells in confluent cell monolayers revealed no correlation between the amount of CDKN1A protein in the bystander cells and the radial distance to the targeted cells. In line with the induction of CDKN1A in bystander cells after irradiation with different LETs, a transient delay in the first G1 phase after irradiation of G0/G1 cells was observed. However, the CDKN1A induction revealed no significant effect on premature terminal differentiation considered to underlie fibrosis in irradiated tissue. Thus the unchanged differentiation pattern in bystander cells does not indicate pronounced, long-lasting effects	
3310	The penumbra of a 6-MV x-ray beam as measured by thermoluminescent dosimetry and evaluated using an inverse square root function	Australia, Biophysics, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Jaw, Models,Structural, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Semiconductors, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Water, X-Rays	Data on the dose distribution in the penumbral region of megavoltage x rays are of importance for most radiotherapy planning systems. For medical linear accelerators the distance between the points representing 20% and 80% of the central axis dose (20/80) is typically only a few millimeters. To achieve good spatial resolution a radiation detector with small physical size has to be used for penumbra measurements. The penumbra in a 6-MV therapeutic x-ray beam was investigated for field sizes of 10 x 10 cm2 and 20 x 20 cm2 at depth of maximum dose (dmax = 1.5 cm) and at 10-cm depth in a solid water phantom. In addition, the field edge of an independent jaw driven to the center of the axis of the primary collimator was investigated. LiF thermoluminescent (TL) ribbons and rods were used embedded in solid water in different geometries resulting in relative detector sizes of 1, 3.1, and 6 mm. A forming function based on an inverse square root function was used to fit the experimental penumbra measurements. For the asymmetric field an amendment to the function is proposed to give a better fit for the experimental data. From the penumbra measured with the three different detector sizes, a penumbra can be extrapolated for an infinitesimal small detector. The extrapolated penumbral width (20/80) was found to be 2.3, 3.2, and 2.7 mm at dmax for the 10 x 10-cm2 symmetric, 10 x 10-cm2 asymmetric, and 20 x 20-cm2 field sizes, respectively. The 20/80 values at 10-cm depth in the solid water phantom for the same radiation fields were 4.2, 4.3, and 4.1 mm, respectively	
3524	Effects of crosslinking and temperature on the dose response of a BANG polymer gel dosimeter	Acrylamide, Acrylamides, Cross-Linking Reagents, Gels, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Magnetics, Phantoms,Imaging, Polymers, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, Temperature, Thermodynamics, Universities, Water, X-Rays	The effects of varying the weight fraction (%C) of the crosslinker N, N'-methylene-bisacrylamide (bis) per total amount of monomer (6% w/w), and the NMR measurement temperature, on the dose response of the transverse relaxation rate (R2) of bis-acrylamide-nitrogen-gelatin (BANG) aqueous polymer gel dosimeters have been investigated. The gel samples were irradiated in test tubes with 250 kV x-rays, and the water proton NMR transverse relaxation rates were measured at 0.47 T using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill multiecho pulse sequence. Both the dose sensitivity (slope of the linear portion of an R2-dose response) and the maximum rate at which the R2-dose response saturated (R2max), were found to depend strongly on the crosslinker fraction and on the temperature of the R2 measurement. The dose sensitivity peaked at approximately 50% C, and, for this composition, varied from 0.14 s-1 Gy-1 at 40 degrees C to 0.48 s-1 Gy-1 at 10 degrees C. The maximum transverse relaxation rates ranged from 0.8 s-1 at 33% C and 40 degrees C to 11.8 s-1 at 83% C and 5 degrees C. These results suggest that water proton transverse relaxation in the gel is controlled by an exchange of magnetization between the aqueous phase and the semi-solid protons associated with the polymer, and that the latter experience spectral broadening from immobilization which increases with crosslinking or cooling. Theoretical and practical implications of the above findings are discussed in the paper

Resistance to one drug carries over resistance to unrelated anticancer drugs leading to multidrug resistance (MDR). A major factor of MDR is P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated ABC transport found in many eukaryotic cells. P-gp acts as a drug eMux pump. The mdr1 gene involved in P-gp 170 protein production is localized in the human chromosome 7 band p2 1.0-21.1. Point mutations after cross-resistance patterns. A variety of stimuli increase the expression of the mdr1 gene: lowered extracellular pH, heat shock, arsenite, cytotoxic agents, anticancer drugs, transfection with oncogenes, HIV-I, and UV-irradiation. An alternative hypothesis to the efflux pump claims that P-gp modifies the intracellular environment to reduce accumulation of anticancer drugs in cancer cells by creating ionic or proton gradients. Chemosensitizers that block P-gp drug extrusion are generally lipid-soluble at physiological pH, possess a basic nitrogen atom and at least two co-planar rings. P-gp blocking does not depend on drug chirality. This opens the way of treating P-gp related MDR with chiral versions of drugs relatively harmless in terms of side-effects. We believe that resistance modifiers combined with cytostatics will chemotherapeutically be more effective for cancer patients. [References: 125]	
1358	Impact of a micromultileaf collimator on stereotactic radiotherapy of uveal melanoma	Austria, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/su [Surgery], Optic Nerve, Particle Accelerators, Radiobiology, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a micro multileaf collimator (mMLC) on Linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of uveal melanoma by comparing circular arc with static conformal, dynamic arc, and intensity-modulated SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty uveal melanoma patients were selected from approximately 100 patients treated with SRT since 1996. For each patient, four treatment plans (BrainSCAN XL, V5.0) were made: conventional arc, static conformal, dynamic arc plan, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The goal of treatment planning was to fully encompass the planning target volume (PTV) by the 80% isodose while minimizing doses to the optic nerve and lens. The following parameters were evaluated: target conformity; target homogeneity; ratio of the target volume and 50% isodose volume; normal tissue receiving doses >/=80%, >/=50%, and >/=20%; central nervous system volume irradiated to >/=20%; optical nerve volume irradiated >/=50%, D(max) of the lens; lens volume receiving >/=20%; and monitor units. RESULTS: PTVs ranged from 0.68 to 4.90 cm(3) (mean 1.97 +/- 0.97 cm(3)). The average reduction of the prescription isodose volume was 1-1.5 cm(3) for conformal (range 2.6-0.3 cm(3)), dynamic arc (range 2.5-0.3 cm(3)), and IMRT plans (range 3.9-0.1 cm(3)), compared with conventional arc therapy. Central nervous system volumes irradiated to doses >/=20% were smallest for conventional or dynamic arc treatments. Average target dose homogeneity values were 1.74 +/- 0.50 for arc, 1.27 +/- 0.02 for static mMLC, 1.26 +/- 0.01 for dynamic arc, and 1.15 +/- 0.03 for IMRT plans. IMRT helped to reduce doses to the lens but did not provide an advantage for optical nerve sparing. When applying IMRT, the monitor units increased by approximately one-third compared with static mMLC-based SRT. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal mMLC and dynamic arc SRT are the treatment options of choice for Linac-based SRT of uveal melanoma. They present dosimetric advantages, while being highly efficient in treatment planning and delivery	
595	Peripheral doses from pediatric IMRT	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	Peripheral dose (PD) data exist for conventional fields (> or = 10 cm) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery to standard adult-sized phantoms. Pediatric peripheral dose reports are limited to conventional therapy and are model based. Our goal was to ascertain whether data acquired from full phantom studies and/or pediatric models, with IMRT treatment times, could predict Organ at Risk (OAR) dose for pediatric IMRT. As monitor units (MUs) are greater for IMRT, it is expected IMRT PD will be higher; potentially compounded by decreased patient size (absorption). Baseline slab phantom peripheral dose measurements were conducted for very small field sizes (from 2 to 10 cm). Data were collected at distances ranging from 5 to 72 cm away from the field edges. Collimation was either with the collimating jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC) oriented either perpendicular or along the peripheral dose measurement plane. For the clinical tests, five patients with intracranial or base of skull lesions were chosen. IMRT and conventional three-dimensional (3D) plans for the same patient/target/dose (180 cGy), were optimized without limitation to the number of fields or wedge use. Six MV, 120-leaf MLC Varian axial beams were used. A phantom mimicking a 3-year-old was configured per Center for Disease Control data. Micro (0.125 cc) and cylindrical (0.6 cc) ionization chambers were appropriated for the thyroid, breast, ovaries, and testes. The PD was recorded by electrometers set to the 10(-10) scale. Each system set was uniquely calibrated. For the slab phantom studies, close peripheral points were found to have a higher dose for low energy and larger field size and when MLC was not deployed. For points more distant from the field edge, the PD was higher for high-energy beams. MLC orientation was found to be inconsequential for the small fields tested. The thyroid dose was lower for IMRT delivery than that predicted for conventional (ratio of IMRT/conventional ranged from 0.47-0.94) doses approximately [0.4-1.8 cGy]/[0.9-2.9 cGy]/fraction, respectively. Prior phantom reports are for fields 10 cm or greater, while pediatric central nervous system fields range from 4 to 7 cm, and effectively much smaller for IMRT (2-6 cm). Peripheral dose in close proximity (< 10 cm from the field edge) is dominated by internal scatter; therefore, field-size differences overwhelm phantom size affects and increased MU. Distant peripheral dose, dominated by head leakage, was higher than predicted, even when accounting for MUs (approximtely factor of 3) likely due to the pediatric phantom size. The ratio of the testes dose ranged from 3.3-5.3 for IMRT/conventional. PD to OAR for pediatric IMRT cannot be predicted from large-field full phantom studies. For regional OAR, doses are likely lower than predicted by existing "large field" data, while the distant PD is higher	
165	Quantification by magnetic resonance spectroscopy of metabolites in seminal plasma able to differentiate different forms of azoospermia	Antineoplastic Agents/ae [Adverse Effects], Choline/me [Metabolism], Citric Acid/me [Metabolism], Diagnosis,Differential, Glycerylphosphorylcholine/me [Metabolism], Humans, Lactic Acid/me [Metabolism], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Oligospermia/di [Diagnosis], Oligospermia/me [Metabolism], Protons, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Semen/me [Metabolism], Spermatogenesis/de [Drug Effects], Spermatogenesis/ph [Physiology], Spermatogenesis/re [Radiation Effects]	The aim was to determine whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of metabolites such as glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), choline, citrate and lactate in human seminal plasma can be used to differentiate (i) different azoospermic patients and (ii) different forms of spermatogenic failure including those who had undergone radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Semen samples were provided by men with obstructive azoospermia and spermatogenic failure who had serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) values within the normal range and either more or less than normal. Four prominent constituents of seminal plasma were identified by 1H-MRS: GPC, choline, citrate and lactate. The peak area ratios of choline/citrate as well as choline/lactate were significantly different (P < 0.01) between groups with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia. When the serum FSH values were normal in men with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia, a significant difference was found in the GPC/choline ratio (P < 0.001). When the FSH values were normal, the GPC/choline ratio appeared to be a very important parameter able to differentiate not only between cases of spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia but also between different forms of spermatogenic failure. These results demonstrate the potential use of 1H-MRS on human seminal plasma in a new approach in the management of male infertility	
3694	Methods for radiation dose distribution analysis and treatment planning in boron neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Energy Transfer, Engineering, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Neutron Capture Therapy, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research	This article presents a survey of recent progress in the development and application of analytical methods for calculating macroscopic and microscopic radiation dose distributions for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). Such calculations are an essential component of in vivo BNCT research and will ultimately also be required for human BNCT treatment planning. Calculations of macroscopic absorbed dose distributions for BNCT are more complex than for photon therapy. There are several different dose components, each of which has its own characteristic spatial distribution, linear energy transfer, and relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Three-dimensional (3-D) energy-dependent radiation transport models with a detailed treatment of particle scattering are required. Geometric descriptions for such models are typically constructed directly from medical image data and both the Monte Carlo stochastic simulation method and the discrete-ordinates deterministic approach have been successfully used to perform the necessary radiation transport calculations. Microdosimetric effects can profoundly influence the therapeutic benefit that may be attainable in BNCT. These effects must be carefully taken into account in the interpretation of experimental data, especially when correlating observed in vivo radiobiological response with absorbed radiation dose. Calculations of microdosimetric parameters for BNCT are typically performed using the Monte Carlo method to generate single-event energy deposition frequency distributions for critical targets in various cell types of interest. This information is useful in the development of apparent RBE factors, or "compound factors" for the various dose components in BNCT	
3399	Reducing electron contamination for photon beam-quality specification	Air, Canada, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/ch [Chemistry], Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Electrons, Head, Humans, Lead, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, Uncertainty	The percentage depth dose at 10 cm in a 10 x 10-cm2 photon beam at an SSD of 100 cm, %dd(10), is a better beam-quality specifier for radiotherapy beams than the commonly used values of TPR10(20) or nominal accelerating potential. The presence of electron contamination affects the measurement of %dd(10) but can be removed by the use of a 0.1-cm lead filter, which reduces surface dose from contaminant electrons from the accelerator by more than 95% for radiotherapy beams with energies from 60Co to 50 MV. The filter performs best when it is placed immediately below the head. An electron-contamination correction factor is introduced to correct for electron contamination from the filter and air. It converts the %dd(10) which includes the electron contamination with the filter in place [hereafter %dd(10)m], into %dd(10) for just the photons in the filtered beam. The correction factor is a linear function of %dd(10)m for all filtered beams with %dd(10)m > 70%. A small correction for the photon filtering effect converts the pure photon %dd(10) for the filtered beam into that for the unfiltered beam, which can be used to determine stopping-power ratio. Calculations show that the values of water-to-air stopping power ratio in the unfiltered beam are related to the values of %dd(10)m in the filtered beam by a cubic function. The uncertainty of stopping-power ratios in unfiltered beams for the same value of the %dd(10)m is within 0.2% for all beams	
759	Monte Carlo simulations for the design of the treatment rooms and synchrotron access mazes in the CNAO Hadrontherapy facility	Carbon, Computer Simulation, Computer-Aided Design, Equipment Design, Equipment Failure Analysis/mt [Methods], Facility Design and Construction/mt [Methods], Humans, Ions, Italy, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Neutrons, Occupational Exposure/an [Analysis], Occupational Exposure/pc [Prevention & Control], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Synchrotrons/is [Instrumentation]	The Italian National Centre for Hadrontherapy is based on a synchrotron capable of accelerating protons and carbon ions up to 250 MeV and 400 MeV u(-1), respectively. The present work describes some Monte Carlo simulations performed to verify the design of the treatment rooms and synchrotron access mazes. The different shielding efficiency and induced activations of the common concrete and the baryte concrete were analysed. In such a radiation field, i.e. with high-energy neutrons, the baryte concrete gains twice the activation than the common concrete without any relevant dose reduction. Moreover, the simulations have stressed, again, the discrepancies between H*(10) and E in such cases where the neutron radiation field is the dominant component and, particularly, in the medium-high energy range	
645	DNA double-strand break misrejoining after exposure of primary human fibroblasts to CK characteristic X rays, 29 kVp X rays and 60Co gamma rays	Cells,Cultured, Chromosome Aberrations, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Mutation, Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, X-Rays	The efficiency of ionizing photon radiation for inducing mutations, chromosome aberrations, neoplastic cell transformation, and cell killing depends on the photon energy. We investigated the induction and rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as possible contributors for the varying efficiencies of different photon energies. A specialized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis assay based on Southern hybridization of single Mbp genomic restriction fragments was employed to assess DSB induction and rejoining by quantifying the restriction fragment band. Unrejoined and misrejoined DSBs were determined in dose fractionation protocols using doses per fraction of 2.2 and 4.4 Gy for CK characteristic X rays, 4 and 8 Gy for 29 kVp X rays, and 5, 10 and 20 Gy for 60Co gamma rays. DSB induction by CK characteristic X rays was about twofold higher than for 60Co gamma rays, whereas 29 kVp X rays showed only marginally elevated levels of induced DSBs compared with 60Co gamma rays (a factor of 1.15). Compared with these modest variations in DSB induction, the variations in the levels of unrejoined and misrejoined DSBs were more significant. Our results suggest that differences in the fidelity of DSB rejoining together with the different efficiencies for induction of DSBs can explain the varying biological effectiveness of different photon energies	
391	Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units	Dose Fractionation, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Supine Position	Interplay between organ (breathing) motion and leaf motion has been shown in the literature to have a small dosimetric impact for clinical conditions (over a 30 fraction treatment). However, previous studies did not consider the case of treatment beams made up of many few-monitor-unit (MU) segments, where the segment delivery time (1-2 s) is of the order of the breathing period (3-5 s). In this study we assess if breathing compromises the radiotherapy treatment with IMRT segments of low number of MUs. We assess (i) how delivered dose varies, from patient to patient, with the number of MU per segment, (ii) if this delivered dose is identical to the average dose calculated without motion over the path of the motion, and (iii) the impact of the daily variation of the delivered dose as a function of MU per segment. The organ motion was studied along two orthogonal directions, representing the left-right and cranial-caudal directions of organ movement for a patient setup in the supine position. Breathing motion was modeled as sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x), based on functions used in the literature to represent organ motion. Measurements were performed with an ionization chamber and films. For a systematic study of motion effects, a MATLAB simulation was written to model organ movement and dose delivery. In the case of a single beam made up of one single segment, the dose delivered to point in a moving target over 30 fractions can vary up to 20% and 10% for segments of 10 MU and 20 MU, respectively. This dose error occurs because the tumor spends most of the time near the edges of the radiation beam. In the case of a single beam made of multiple segments with low MU, we observed 2.4%, 3.3%, and 4.3% differences, respectively, for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion, between delivered dose and motion-averaged dose for points in the penumbra region of the beam and over 30 fractions. In approximately 5-10% of the cases, differences between the motion-averaged dose and the delivered 30-fraction dose could reach 6%, 8% and 10-12%, respectively for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion. To analyze a clinical IMRT beam, two patient plans were randomly selected. For one of the patients, the beams showed a likelihood of up to 25.6% that the delivered dose would deviate from the motion-averaged dose by more than 1%. For the second patient, there was a likelihood of up to 62.8% of delivering a dose that differs by more than 1% from the motion-averaged dose and a likelihood of up to approximately 30% for a 2% dose error. For the entire five-beam IMRT plan, statistical averaging over the beams reduces the overall dose error between the delivered dose and the motion-averaged dose. For both patients there was a likelihood of up to 7.0% and 33.9% that the dose error was greater than 1%, respectively. For one of the patients, there was a 12.6% likelihood of a 2% dose error. Daily intrafraction variation of the delivered dose of more than 10% is non-negligible and can potentially lead to biological effects. We observed [for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x)] that below 10-15 MU leads to large daily variations of the order of 15-35%. Therefore, for small MU segments, non-negligible biological effects can be incurred. We conclude that for most clinical cases the effects may be small because of the use of many beams, it is desirable to avoid low-MU segments when treating moving targets. In addition, dose averaging may not work well for hypo-fractionation, where fewer fractions are used. For hypo-fractionation, PDF modeling of the tumor motion in IMRT optimization may not be adequate	
1648	CT simulation in nodal positive breast cancer	Arm, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Graphics, Computer Simulation, Female, Germany, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Supine Position, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uncertainty, Universities	BACKGROUND: A variety of solutions are used to match tangential fields and opposed lymph node fields in irradiation of nodal positive breast cancer. The choice is depending on the technical equipment which is available and the clinical situation. The CT simulation of a non-monoisocentric technique was evaluated in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: The field match parameters were adjusted virtually at CT simulation and were compared with parameters derived mathematically. The coordinate transfer from the CT simulator to the conventional simulator was analyzed in 25 consecutive patients. RESULTS: The angles adjusted virtually for a geometrically exact coplanar field match corresponded with the angles calculated for each set-up. The mean isocenter displacement was 5.7 mm and the total uncertainty of the coordinate transfer was 6.7 mm (1 SD). Limitations in the patient set-up became obvious because of the steep arm abduction necessary to fit the 70 cm CT gantry aperture. Required modifications of the arm position and coordinate transfer errors led to a significant shift of the marked matchline of > 1.0 cm in eight of 25 patients (32%). CONCLUSION: The virtual CT simulation allows a precise and graphic definition of the field match parameters. However, modifications of the virtual set-up basically due to technical limitations were required in a total of 32% of cases, so that a hybrid technique was adapted at present that combines virtual adjustment of the ideal field alignment parameters with conventional simulation	
4704	Fractionated proton beam irradiation of pituitary adenomas	Adenoma/mo [Mortality], Adenoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenoma/se [Secretion], Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/se [Secretion], Adult, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Necrosis, Patients, Pituitary Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pituitary Neoplasms/se [Secretion], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Temporal Lobe, Thyrotropin/se [Secretion], Universities	PURPOSE: Various radiation techniques and modalities have been used to treat pituitary adenomas. This report details our experience with proton treatment of these tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-seven patients with pituitary adenomas treated with protons, who had at least 6 months of follow-up, were included in this analysis. Forty-two patients underwent a prior surgical resection; 5 were treated with primary radiation. Approximately half the tumors were functional. The median dose was 54 cobalt-gray equivalent. RESULTS: Tumor stabilization occurred in all 41 patients available for follow-up imaging; 10 patients had no residual tumor, and 3 had greater than 50% reduction in tumor size. Seventeen patients with functional adenomas had normalized or decreased hormone levels; progression occurred in 3 patients. Six patients have died; 2 deaths were attributed to functional progression. Complications included temporal lobe necrosis in 1 patient, new significant visual deficits in 3 patients, and incident hypopituitarism in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: Fractionated conformal proton-beam irradiation achieved effective radiologic, endocrinological, and symptomatic control of pituitary adenomas. Significant morbidity was uncommon, with the exception of postradiation hypopituitarism, which we attribute in part to concomitant risk factors for hypopituitarism present in our patient population

Resection is the standard treatment for many sacral tumors, but many types of sacral lesions have the potential for recurrence after excision. In these cases, adjuvant radiotherapy is often beneficial. Although conventional radiotherapy plays an important role in the management of spinal lesions, the radiation doses required for adequate local control of many sacral lesions generally exceed the tolerance doses of normal tissues, thus limiting its definitive role in the management of sacral tumors. Recent advances in the field of stereotactic radiosurgery have allowed precise targeting of the sacrum. In this report the authors review the use of these two forms of radiation treatment and their role in managing sacral tumors. [References: 44]	
2061	Monte Carlo simulation of dose distributions from a synchrotron-produced microplanar beam array using the EGS4 code system	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Electrons, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Synchrotrons, Time, X-Rays	Microbeam therapy is established as a general concept for brain tumour treatment. A synchrotron based x-ray source was chosen for experimental research into microbeam therapy, and therefore new simulations were essential for investigating the therapy parameters with a proper description of the synchrotron radiation characteristics. To design therapy parameters for tumour treatments, the newly upgraded LSCAT (Low energy SCATtering) package of the EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation code was adapted to develop an accurate self-written user code for calculating microbeam radiation dose profiles with a precision of 1 microm. LSCAT is highly suited to this purpose due to its ability to simulate low-energy x-ray transport with detailed photon interactions (including bound electron incoherent scattering functions, and linear polarized coherent scattering). The properties of the synchrotron x-ray microbeam, including its polarization, source spectrum and beam penumbra, were simulated by the new user codes. Two concentric spheres, an inner sphere, defined as a brain, and a surrounding sphere, defined as a skull, represented the phantom. The microbeam simulation was tested using a 3 x 3 cm array beam for small treatment areas and a 6 x 6 cm array for larger ones, with different therapy parameters, such as beam width and spacing. The results showed that the microbeam array retained an adequate peak-to-valley ratio, of five times at least, at tissue depths suitable for radiation therapy. Dose measurements taken at 1 microm resolution with an 'edge-on' MOSFET validated the basics of the user code for microplanar radiation therapy

Additionally, the decay of Po-isotopes from deuteron irradiation of natural bismuth (209Bi) was exploited for radiobismuth production. 205Bi was produced from 206Pb at 20 MeV with only 2% of 206Bi at 4 weeks post irradiation. Bismuth compounds as used in the treatment of peptic ulcer were labeled with 205Bi for absorption studies in animals and subjects

Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are usually required for evaluation of intracranial chordomas due to bone involvement and the proximity of these tumors to many critical soft-tissue structures. At CT, intracranial chordoma typically appears as a centrally located, well-circumscribed, expansile soft-tissue mass that arises from the clivus with associated extensive lytic bone destruction. However, MR imaging is the single best imaging modality for both pre- and posttreatment evaluation of intracranial chordoma. On T1-weighted MR images, intracranial chordomas demonstrate intermediate to low signal intensity and are easily recognized within the high-signal-intensity fat of the clivus. On T2-weighted MR images, they characteristically demonstrate very high signal intensity, a finding that likely reflects the high fluid content of vacuolated cellular components. Moderate to marked enhancement is common and often heterogeneous on contrast material-enhanced images. Combination treatment with radical surgical resection and proton beam radiation therapy achieves the best results. Copyright RSNA, 2003 [References: 35]

This article summarizes the current status of preclinical and clinical research on 223RaCl2. Potential advantages of 223Ra to that of external beam irradiation and registered beta-emitting bone seekers are discussed. Published data of 223Ra dosimetry in mice and a therapeutic study in a skeletal metastases model in nude rats have indicated significant therapeutic potential of bone-seeking alpha-emitters. This article provides short-term and long-term results from the first clinical single dosage trial. We also present data from a repeated dosage study of five consecutive injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight, once every 3rd week, or two injections of 125 kBq/kg body weight, 6 weeks apart. Furthermore, interim results are described for a randomized phase 2 trial involving 64 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and painful skeletal metastases who received four monthly injections of 223Ra or saline as an adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy. Lastly, we present preliminary dose estimates for 223Ra in humans. Results indicate that repeated dosing is feasible and toxicity is low, and that opportunities are available for combined treatment strategies. [References: 57]

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma

Radiation reduces cell division in the target tissue. The individual parameters of the radiation procedure are determined within the framework of the interdisciplinarily conceived treatment. Tumour control probability depends on tumour-specific factors and on the dosage as well as on the treatment period. The macroscopic and microscopic extend of the tumour area determines the target volume and dosage of the radiation. Conformal radiation is the standard procedure in primary radiation treatment. The anticipated side effects influence the therapy concept and the radiation parameters. Long-term aftercare of the tumour patient is imperative. [References: 13]	
3511	[Results of treatment of Itsenko-Cushing disease using proton irradiation of the hypophysis]. [Russian]	Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Aged, Cushing Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Pituitary Irradiation, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The application of protons (heavy charged particles) for irradiation of the pituitary body has some essential advantages over other types of teletherapy: insignificant destruction of surrounding tissues, a possibility of a single therapeutic session as well as the absence of post-radiation effects. Proton beam therapy was given to 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease aged 15 to 40. Mild cases were treated by proton beam irradiation only while severe cases were managed using proton beam therapy combined with unilateral adrenalectomy or oral administration of ortho-para-DDD. Catamnesis duration varied from 3 to 5 years. In most cases the exposure dose was 80-90 Gy (50-110 Gy). The procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. A dynamic multipolar converting method with 15-20 entrance poles in the left temporal area was employed (with the beam energy of 200 MeV). Stabilization of the course of disease and some clinical improvement were observed in most of the patients 3-4 months after proton beam therapy. In 6-36 months after irradiation 90% of the patients showed normal biochemical indices and the absence of any clinical signs of the disease. Three-five years after treatment, 94% of the patients were in steady remission. A 24-hour ACTH and cortisol normalization pattern was observed in all the patients in parallel with an increase in GH and gonadotropin secretion and a decrease in the prolactin level. Sex function renewal appeared to be the first clinical sign of remission. Young patients aged 15 to 20 with a short duration of disease reached remission faster than patients of the other age groups. Thus the results of proton beam therapy of 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease after a follow-up of 3-5 years showed a high efficacy of this type of treatment. The method can be used alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy as well as with oral administration of ortho-para-DDD

We studied these changes in the temporal lobe in six patients, following radiosurgery on the amygdala and hippocampus. (1)H MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T with short and long echo times (TE=10 and 135 ms) were used together with standard MR imaging sequences (T1-, T2-weighted). The treatment was performed by Leksell Gamma Knife with a dose of 50 Gy to the center and a 50% isodose to the margin of the target, represented by the mean volume of approximately 7.5 ml. Magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy examinations were performed at least once per year for 3 years. The most significant changes in spectra were observed approximately 1 year after the irradiation when edema in irradiated area was observed and strong signal of lipids was identified. Later, edema and lipid signals disappeared and follow-up was characterized by a decrease of NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations in the ipsilateral region of the brain to the irradiation (LCModel calculation from voxel of interest 3.8-4.5 ml positioned into the centrum of target volume). The concentration of NAA, Cr, and Cho after radiosurgery was significantly different from control values ( p<0.05) and also from concentrations in the contralateral part of the brain ( p<0.05). In the contralateral part, the concentration of NAA was significantly increased ( p<0.05) (NAA: before treatment 8.81, after treatment 11.33 mM). No radiotoxic changes were observed in the contralateral part of the brain or behind the area of target volume.

The use of protons resulted in homogeneous irradiation of a preset target volume without injuring the adjacent organs and tissues. Proton beam irradiation of the uterus was combined with gamma-beam therapy of the zones of regional metastatic spreading. Postradiation reactions were unobserved in the adjacent bladder and rectum in patients receiving combined therapy and irradiation alone. The clinical efficacy of proton beam irradiation was confirmed by the treatment of 160 patients

The patients were treated seated in a fixed position with a stereotactic approach. Titanium-markers to the outer table served for identification and verification of the target positioning for dose planning and irradiation. The patients were given a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6 Gy fractions. All patients have been followed for at least 36 months. So far no meningiomas have progressed after treatment. Two patients have developed corticosteroid responsive oedema in the target area 6 moths after treatment. Late, but not serious, symptoms of side effects have been observed in one patient	
3867	Medical accelerator safety considerations: report of AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee Task Group No. 35	Biophysics, Computer Systems, Environment, Equipment Failure, Humans, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Safety, Safety Management, Societies,Scientific, Technology,Radiologic/ed [Education], United States	Ensuring safe operation for a medical accelerator is a difficult task. Users must assume more responsibility in using contemporary equipment. Additionally, users must work closely with manufacturers in promoting the safe and effective use of such complex equipment. Complex treatment techniques and treatment modality changeover procedures merit detailed, unambiguous written procedural instruction at the control console. A thorough "hands on" training period after receiving instructions, and before assuming treatment responsibilities, is essential for all technologists. Unambiguous written instructions must also be provided to guide technologists in safe response when equipment malfunctions or exhibits unexpected behavior or after any component has been changed or readjusted. Technologists should be given a written list of the appropriate individuals to consult when unexpected machine behavior occurs. They should be assisted in identifying aberrant behavior of equipment. Many centers already provide this instruction, but others may not. Practiced response and discussion with technologists should be a part of an ongoing quality assurance program. An important aspect of a safety program is the need for continuous vigilance. Table III gives a summary of a comprehensive safety program for medical accelerators. Table IV gives a list of summary recommendations as an example of how one might mitigate the consequences of an equipment failure and improve procedures and operator response in the context of the environment described. Most of these recommendations can be implemented almost immediately at any individual treatment center

Patients with cervix or esophageal cancer were treated with 10 MV X-rays produced at a LINAC accelerator, or high-energy carbon ions produced at the HIMAC accelerator at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba. Blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the radiation treatment. Chromosomes were prematurely condensed by incubation in calyculin A. Aberrations in chromosomes 2 and 4 were scored after fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole-chromosome probes. Pre-treatment samples were exposed in vitro to X-rays, individual dose-response curves for the induction of chromosomal aberrations were determined, and used as calibration curves to calculate the effective whole-body dose absorbed during the treatment. This calculated dose, based on the calibration curve relative to the induction of reciprocal exchanges, has a sharp increase after the first few fractions of the treatment, then saturates at high doses. Although carbon ions are 2-3 times more effective than X-rays in tumor sterilization, the effective dose was similar to that of X-ray treatment. However, the frequency of complex-type chromosomal exchanges was much higher for patients treated with carbon ions than X-ray

The diffusion change coincides cytotoxic cell eradication and precedes volume reduction in drug or gene therapy-treated experimental tumours. Interestingly, the recent studies from human brain tumour patients undergoing chemotherapy show similar behaviour of diffusion, suggesting important application for MRI in patient management. In this review observations from diffusion MRI and MRS in the tumours during cytotoxic treatment are summarized and the cellular mechanisms affecting molecular mobility are discussed in the light of tissue microenvironmental and microdynamic changes.

3949	Neutron dosimetry with spherical ionisation chambers III. Calculated results for tissue-equivalent chambers	Air, Computers, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Biological, Neutrons, Radiotherapy Dosage	Values are given of the average energy required to produce an ion pair, Wn, and of the dose conversion factor, r, for tissue-equivalent chambers filled with either tissue-equivalent gas or air, irradiated by neutrons. The model for finite spherical cavities previously presented in part I was used for the calculations, which employed the W values and stopping powers of the charged particles produced in the materials described in part II. Neutron energies ranging from 0.4 to 14 MeV were considered: many of these energies were chosen because of their particularly large or small total cross-sections in order to explore the range of fluctuations of r and Wn. The results are therefore not very suitable for spectral averaging. Cavity sizes ranging from the infinitesimal Bragg-Gray to the infinite cavity were studied. It was found that the changes of r with cavity size and with neutron energy are smaller for the TE-TE chamber than for the TE-air chamber, but for Wn they are about equal; the TE-TE chamber should therefore be considered the ionisation chamber of choice but absolute doses cannot be determined with it to better than +/- 8%	
2146	Loss of normal G1 checkpoint control is an early step in carcinogenesis, independent of p53 status	Alpha Particles, Animals, Boston, Cell Cycle/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Division/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Transformation,Neoplastic, Clone Cells, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Exons, Fibroblasts, G1 Phase, Genes,p53, Humans, Kinetics, Massachusetts, Mice, Mutation, Point Mutation, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Polymorphism,Single-Stranded Conformational, Public Health, Research, Time Factors, X-Rays	Recent studies have described a diminished radiation-induced G1 arrest in some wild-type (wt) p53 human tumor cell lines compared to normal human fibroblasts. However, the significance of this finding was unclear, particularly because tumor cell lines may have accumulated additional genetic changes after long periods in culture. Because malignant transformation of individual cells is thought to be an early step in carcinogenesis, we have used a model system of normal and transformed mouse fibroblast 10T1/2 cell clones to examine whether loss of G1 checkpoint control may be an early event in tumor development and to study the relationships between G1 arrest, radiosensitivity, and genetic alterations. Twelve transformed clones were established from type III foci induced by irradiation of normal 10T1/2 cells and were compared with six clones derived from wt 10T1/2 cells. Three of the transformed clones expressed mutant p53; two of these had the same point mutation at codon 132 (exon 5), and one had a point mutation at codon 135. The remaining transformed and normal clones had wt p53 status. The radiosensitivity of transformed clones, as measured by a clonogenic assay, was similar to that of normal clones; the three clones with mutant p53 did not differ from the others. There was no relationship between G1 arrest and radiosensitivity. Normal 10T1/2 cell clones showed a transient G1 arrest lasting approximately 9 h after 6 Gy of irradiation. This G1 arrest was either absent or markedly reduced in all of the transformed clones, regardless of p53 status. These results suggest that diminished G1 checkpoint control is an early event in the process of carcinogenesis that is associated with the malignant transformation of individual cells and is independent of p53 status

643	[Results of treating uveal melanoma with proton beam radiation: 10-year follow-up]. [French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Optic Disk, Radiation, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: We analyzed the long-term results of uveal melanoma treatment with proton beam irradiation in a series of patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were treated with proton beam radiation between September 1991 and December 1992. They had an initial examination including visual acuity, funduscopy, A and B scan ultrasonography of the eye, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. General examination included chest radiography and B scan ultrasonography of the liver. All tumors received a total dose of 60 cobalt-Gray equivalents (applied in four daily fractions) at the Orsay proton therapy center. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were treated with a median follow-up of 116 months. Their median age was 59 years. Thirteen tumors were anterior to the equator, 76 overlapped the equator and 78 were posterior to the equator. An initial retinal detachment was present in 41 cases. The optic disk was invaded in 10 cases. The median tumor diameter was 12 mm and the median tumor thickness was 5.8 mm. The mean initial acuity was 20/50. The survival rate was 62.93% at 10 years; 72.9% of deaths resulted from metastasis. Statistically significant risk factors for death identified in the multivariate analysis were tumor diameter greater than 12 mm (p=0.0004) and age over 60 years (p=0.0001). The metastasis rate at 10 years was 31%. The liver was affected in 97.8% of these patients. Risk factors for metastasis were the anterior site of the tumor, its volume greater than 0.4 cc and the presence of retinal detachment at diagnosis. The secondary enucleation rate at 10 years was 13.23%, mainly attributable to secondary neovascular glaucoma. The local recurrence rate was 6%. The visual acuity rate in 42.1% of patients was better than 20/100 at 10 years. Visual loss was mainly due to postradiation maculopathy and neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the long-term results found in the literature on proton beam radiation. This therapy allows good tumor control, an excellent eye retention rate, and good final visual acuity for approximately half of the patients	
4448	The effect of dose rate dependence of p-type silicon detectors on linac relative dosimetry	Biophysics, Canada, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Humans, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Semiconductors, Silicon	Cumulative radiation damage to silicon semiconductor diode detectors can induce dose rate dependent sensitivity, a concern in the pulsed beam of a linac. Two p-Si diode photon detectors were used in this study, diodes A and B. Both were preirradiated by the supplier to 5 kGy, with diode A receiving an estimated 8 kGy from measurements, and diode B, 25 kGy. At 6 MV, the PDD measured with diode B was lower (by 4.4% at a depth of 25 cm) than diode A. Using SSD to vary the dose per pulse from 0.02 to 0.64 mGy/pulse, diode A was dose rate independent (within 2%), while the sensitivity of diode B changed by 13%. Silicon diode detectors should be checked regularly against ionization chambers in the pulsed beam of a linac, especially older high-resistivity diodes that have accumulated dose from high-energy photon beams	
3308	A study of the characteristics of radiation contaminants within a clinically useful photon beam	Electrons, Humans, Jaw, Mathematics, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], X-Rays	Contaminant radiation within a therapeutic beam has been studied for accelerator-produced 24-MV x rays by a direct measurement utilizing independent jaws. A carefully positioned diode was exposed to secondary radiation for various collimator settings that project field sizes between [10 X (0 + 5)] and [26 X (0 + 13)] cm at a source-to-axis distance of 1 m. [The notation [L X (W1 + W2)] means the projected field area due to lower (L) and upper (W1, W2) jaws.] Measurements were taken by placing polystyrene sheets with density thicknesses ranging from 0.21 to 4.53 g cm-2 in front of the detector. The data strongly demonstrate that with increasing field size, the ratio of the dose due to electrons to that due to photons increases rapidly. The characteristic feature of the electron depth dose curves may be linked to the observed shift in the depth of dose maximum (dmax) with field size. Data taken with a magnetic field of 0.15 T permit analysis of photons and electrons with regard to their intensity, energy, and behavior in a phantom. From an analysis of 12.5 X 12.5 cm data, various radiation components have been studied and are correlated with the observed contaminants

Despite improvements in the detection of premalignant pathology, newer preventative strategies, and the development of more effective combination therapies, the overall incidence of esophageal carcinomas has risen. A clear association has been established between the development of esophageal cancer and Helicobacter pylori infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, smoking, and heavy alcohol use. However, the growing number of newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinomas, despite widespread treatments with proton pump inhibitors and the eradication of H. pylori, leaves the medical community searching for more answers. There is a potential link between esophageal adenocarcinoma and obesity. Common presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia, odynophagia, and progressive weight loss. The initial assessment for patients with these symptoms is made with double-contrast barium esophagraphy. Treatment modalities include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of modalities. Prevention strategies include smoking and alcohol cessation. [References: 38]	
3817	A rapid method for electron beam energy check	Electrons, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards], Time, Universities	Assessment of electron beam energy and its long term stability is part of standard quality assurance practice in radiation oncology. Conventional depth-ionization or depth-film density measurements are time consuming both in terms of data acquisition and analysis. A procedure is described utilizing ionization measurements at two energy specific depths. It is based on a linear relationship between electron beam energy and its practical range. Energy shifts within the range covered by the two measurement depths are easily resolved. Within a range of +/- 0.50 MeV (+/- 1.30 MeV) around the established mean incident energy of 5.48 MeV (20.39 MeV), the method accuracy is better than 0.10 MeV

[Review] [63 refs]	Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Eye Enucleation, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Laser Coagulation, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Pennsylvania, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe recent advances in the management of choroidal melanoma. RECENT FINDINGS: During the past 10 years, there has been a trend in the management of choroidal melanoma from enucleation to conservative nonenucleation treatments such as thermotherapy, plaque radiotherapy, charged-particle radiotherapy, and local resection. Recently published information regarding conservative management has revealed that plaque radiotherapy combined with thermotherapy offers 97% tumor control, similar to charged-particle radiotherapy. Additionally, patient survival after treatment of medium-size melanoma is similar when comparing plaque radiotherapy versus enucleation. Risk factors identifying small choroidal melanoma include patient symptoms, tumor thickness more than 2 mm, presence of associated subretinal fluid, presence of orange pigment on the tumor surface, and location of the tumor margin at the optic disc. These factors assist in early detection of choroidal melanoma. SUMMARY: The management of choroidal melanoma continues to improve with earlier detection of tumors and better treatment methods. Local tumor control is excellent with radiotherapeutic methods. Future studies should investigate control of subclinical metastasis. [References: 63]	
2304	Optimization of parameters for fitting linear accelerator photon beams using a modified CBEAM model	Humans, Nuclear Medicine, Particle Accelerators, Pennsylvania, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Software, Universities	Measured beam profiles and central-axis depth-dose data for 6- and 25-MV photon beams are used to generate a dose matrix which represents the full beam. A corresponding dose matrix is also calculated using the modified CBEAM model. The calculational model uses the usual set of three parameters to define the intensity at beam edges and the parameter that accounts for collimator transmission. An additional set of three parameters is used for the primary profile factor, expressed as a function of distance from the central axis. An optimization program has been adapted to automatically adjust these parameters to minimize the chi 2 between the measured and calculated data. The average values of the parameters for small (6 X 6 cm2), medium (10 X 10 cm2), and large (20 X 20 cm2) field sizes are found to represent the beam adequately for all field sizes. The calculated and the measured doses at any point agree to within 2% for any field size in the range 4 X 4 to 40 X 40 cm2

It describes a percutaneous, stereotactically guided irradiation delivering a single high dose with collimated narrow beams. The precise stereotactic localization of the target point and a steep dose gradient outside the target volume allow the administration of high doses to a lesion without damage to adjacent normal tissue. Risk of necrosis, due to a dose volume relationship represents the limits of radiosurgery. Units for radiosurgery were designed at Stockholm using multiple external cobalt-60-gamma sources, at Boston operating with protons of a cyclotron, at Berkeley operating with helium ions accelerated by a synchrocyclotron. An attractive alternative to these complicated and expensive facilities is the use of a modified linear accelerator. At the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg such a system was developed and has been available for the treatment of patients since 1984. Though, data of over 100,000 patients with vascular malformations and cancer disease are available worldwide, the indication for this therapy is validated only for a minority of entities. In cases of inoperable arteriovenous malformations favourable results in achieving obliteration range between 60% and 100% were obtained. Median survival for solitary brain metastases with controlled, extracerebral tumor diseases were between nine and twelve months. Up to now, advantages of stereotactic irradiation for benign tumor masses could not be proven. Therefore, randomized trials should be initiated in this field, considering decisive improvements in local tumor control with techniques of microsurgery and fractionated, postoperative radiotherapy during the last few years.

One radionuclide that has been generated and tested in our laboratory in vitro and in vivo is lead 212 (212Pb). Intraperitoneal instillation of 212Pb prolonged survival and totally eradicated tumor in 24% of mice inoculated with the extremely virulent Ehrlich ascites-producing tumor. In vitro 212Pb was two to four times more effective in killing human ovarian cancer cells than x-rays. Irradiation with 212Pb increased the radiosensitivity and chromosomal aberrations of cells. In dogs, intraperitoneal instillation of 2.6 mCi of ferrous hydroxide tagged with 212Pb caused no significant toxicity. It appears that alpha-emitting radionucides such as 212Pb have the potential to be a new and potent treatment of ovarian carcinoma and could be effective in cases that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or x-ray therapy

The changes in the beam energy of 0.78% and 0.32% at low and high electron energies, respectively, induced by the insertion of 0.1 mm A1 absorber were clearly visible in the residual distributions. The changes in the photon beam were introduced by rotation of the gantry or the collimator. The applicability of the method to quantitatively monitor any changes in the treatment beam characteristics is presented	
1403	A new perspective of carcinogenesis from protracted high-LET radiation arises from the two-stage clonal expansion model	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Bystander Effect/ph [Physiology], Colorado, Cosmic Radiation, Humans, Kinetics, Linear Energy Transfer, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Lung Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Mining, Models,Biological, Mutation, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Occupational Exposure, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radon, Research, Risk Assessment, Space Flight, Stem Cells/re [Radiation Effects]	When applied to the Colorado Plateau miner population, the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model of radiation carcinogenesis predicts that radiation-induced promotion dominates radiation-induced initiation. Thus, according to the model, at least for alpha-particle radiation from inhaled radon daughters, lung cancer induction over long periods of protracted irradiation appears to be dominated by radiation-induced modification of the proliferation kinetics of already-initiated cells rather than by direct radiation-induced initiation (i.e., mutation) of normal cells. We explore the possible consequences of this result for radiation exposures to space travelers on long missions. Still unknown is the LET dependence of this effect. Speculations of the cause of this phenomenon include the suggestion that modification of cell kinetics is caused by a "bystander" effect, i.e., the traversal of normal cells by alpha particles, followed by the signaling of these cells to nearby initiated cells which then modify their proliferation kinetics. c2002 COSPAR.

The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radioinduced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described. [References: 29]

Results for the surface dose measurements ranged from approximately 8% of the maximum dose for a 5 X 5 cm field, up to 36% for a 40 X 40 cm field, 100-cm source-skin distance. The effect of a 0.6-cm-thick polycarbonate blocking tray and metal filters on the surface and buildup dose is also reported. In addition, ionization measurements were made to document the dose perturbations caused by the absence of backscattering material at the exit surface of a polystyrene phantom. Exit dose measurements showed a 15% reduction in dose with essentially no scattering material beyond the measurement point. Near full scatter condition could be restored by placing 5-10 mm (depending on field size) of unit density material directly behind the ion chamber's distal surface

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, 175 patients received C-ion RT using a recommended dose fractionation (66.0 GyE/20 fractions) established from prior studies. C-ion RT alone was performed for 33 patients constituting a low-risk group (Stage < or =T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml and Gleason score < or =6); the remaining 142 high-risk patients received an additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and bNED rates were 91% and 87%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all but one patient. The 4-year bNED rates were 87% in the low-risk group and 88% in the high-risk group. In very advanced diseases (Stage > or= T3a or PSA > or= 20 ng/ml or Gleason score > or =8), there was significant difference in the bNED rate according to period of ADT administration (ADT > or =24 months: 93%, ADT <24 months: 73%, p<0.01). Grade 2 late toxicities developed in 4 patients (2%) for the rectum and 9 patients (5%) for the genitourinary system but no Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of C-ion RT for prostate cancer has been well confirmed. Based on these results, new study of a C-ion RT modified for the administration strategy of ADT according to the patient risk has been started by dividing patients into 3 groups, high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk

Air, Cells,Cultured, Chromosome Aberrations, Chromosomes,Human/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Male, Mammography, Mammography/ae [Adverse Effects], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Dosage, Research, X-Rays	We examined the production of dicentrics in human lymphocytes irradiated with 29 kV X-rays to a depth of 13.5 mm in a PMMA phantom. For these irradiation conditions, which are appropriate for the diagnostic application of mammography X-rays, a coefficient alpha of (5.88+/-0.66) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) of the linear quadratic dose-response relationship was determined. This value does not differ significantly from the coefficient alpha of (6.55+/-0.97) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) obtained earlier for a free-in-air set-up using blood of the same donor. The results are interpreted in terms of both the energy distributions of the photon fluence of mammography X-rays free-in-air and those in the PMMA phantom. Based on earlier results of experiments with monochromatic X-rays in the energy range 1.83-40 keV (completed here by an additional measurement at 25 keV), a fit function alpha(E) to the measured alpha coefficients as a function of the energy E of monochromatic X-rays was used to calculate weighted mean values alpha for both the mammography X-ray spectra free-in-air and in the phantom. As a result, weighted mean values of (4.9+/-1.0) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) and (4.5+/-1.0) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) were obtained, respectively. Although the measured alpha coefficients for mammography X-rays appear to be systematically higher than those calculated as weighted mean values alpha, it can be concluded that the modification of the mammography X-ray spectrum to a depth of 13.5 mm in a PMMA phantom compared with the free-in-air spectrum has no significant influence on the dicentric yields in human lymphocytes	
2720	Neutron radiotherapy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Cavernous Sinus, Cyclotrons, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neutrons, Palliative Care, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull, Spinal Cord, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time, Universities, Washington	PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of fast neutron radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands and to identify prognostic variables associated with local control, overall survival, and cause specific survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients having adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands were treated with fast neutron radiotherapy during the years 1985-1994. All patients had either unresectable disease or gross disease remaining after attempted surgical extirpation. Seventeen patients had previously received conventional radiotherapy and their subsequent treatment fields and doses for neutron radiotherapy were modified for critical sites (brainstem, spinal cord, brain). Although the median doses (tumor maximum and tumor minimum) only varied by < or = 10%, treatment portals were substantially smaller in these patients because of normal tissue complication considerations. Twelve patients (13%) had distant metastases at the time of treatment and were only treated palliatively with smaller treatment portals and lower median tumor doses (< or = 80% of the doses delivered to curatively treated patients). Seventy-two patients were treated with curative intent, with nine of these having recurrent tumors after prior full-dose radiotherapy. The median duration of follow-up at the time of analysis was 31.5 months (range 3-115). Sites of disease and number of patients treated per disease site were as follows: paranasal sinus-31; oral cavity-20; oropharynx-12; nasopharynx-11; trachea-6; and other sites in the head and neck-4. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial local-regional tumor control rate for all patients treated with curative intent was 47%. Patients without involvement of the cavernous sinus, base of skull, or nasopharynx (51 patients) had a 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate of 59%, whereas local-regional control was significantly lower (15%) for patients with tumors involving these sites (p < 0.005). In the latter cases, normal tissue injury considerations precluded delivery of the full dose to the entire tumor. Patients with no history of prior radiotherapy (63 patients) had an actuarial local control rate of 57% at 5 years compared to 18% for those (9 patients) who had been previously irradiated with conventional photons (p = 0.018). Eliminating the dose-limiting factors of prior radiation therapy and/or high risk sites of involvement, the 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate for these 46 patients was 63%, with an actuarial cause specific survival rate of 79%. Lymph node status was a predictor of distant metastasis: 57% of node positive patients developed distant metastases by 5 years compared to 15% of patients with negative nodes (p < 0.0005), and patients who had nodal involvement developed distant metastases sooner than node negative patients (p < 0.0001). The 5-year actuarial overall survival and cause specific survival for the 72 patients treated with curative intent were 59% and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fast neutron radiotherapy offers high local-regional control and survival rates for patients with locally advanced, unresectable adenoid cystic carcinomas of minor salivary glands. It should be considered as initial primary treatment for these patients, as well as for other patients in whom surgical extirpation would cause considerable morbidity

[German]	Adult, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	A report is given about radiotherapy in 41 patients suffering from cerebral vessel anomalies. A modified linear accelerator was used in a moving field technique with multiple pendulum planes to apply single doses between 8 and 28 Gy by means of stereotaxis into the angiographically determined target volume. The medium follow-up is 23 months. The latency of radiogenic effects is between one and two years. Radiological controls with an interval of more than 18 months after therapy are available in 17 out of 41 patients. Angiographic investigation showed complete obliterations of pathological vessels in six out of these patients and partial obliterations in six patients; five patients remained unchanged. There were no acute complications. Seven patients presented neurological deficiencies with a latency of 6 to 12 months, however, in all cases but one they regressed completely. Even taking into consideration the small number of patients and the short time of observation, a comparison with the results of other radiotherapeutical proceedings allows to draw the conclusion that the presented technique of stereotaxic convergent-beam irradiation represents a relatively simple, reliable and, in case of precise indication, efficient method for the therapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations

[Review] [42 refs]	Animals, Brachytherapy, Cell Physiology/re [Radiation Effects], DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Half-Life, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Biological, Models,Chemical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiobiology/mt [Methods], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/ch [Chemistry], Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/ch [Chemistry], Radiopharmaceuticals/re [Radiation Effects], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research	Although the general radiobiologic principles underlying external beam therapy and radionuclide therapy are the same, there are significant differences in the radiobiologic effects observed in mammalian cells. External beam and brachytherapy emissions are composed of photons, whereas radiations of interest in radionuclide therapy are particulate. The special features that characterize the biologic effects consequent to the traversal of charged particles through mammalian cells are explored with respect to DNA lesions and cellular responses. Information about the ways in which these radionuclides are used to treat cancers in experimental models are highlighted. [References: 42]

Sometimes it is not possible either clinically or histologically to differentiate between a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and benign lymphoid hyperplasia. A series of 24 patients is reported. Nineteen were classified as having malignant NHL and 5 benign hyperplasia; 1 of these 5 later developed metastases, however. All patients had systemic work-up: 18 had Stage I, 1 had Stage II, and 5 had Stage IV disease. All patients received local radiation therapy with doses of 2400 to 2750 rad in 2-3 weeks for lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva, and between 3000 and 3750 rad in 3-4 weeks for retrobulbar lesions. The lens was shielded in all patients except in 2 who had NHL of the vitreous body. A method of shielding the lens with a lead block mounted on a "low vac lens" is described, and the dose distribution within the eye and orbit is presented. The dose to the ocular lens is reduced to about 10% of the tumor dose with this technique. Patients who were treated with doses higher than 3000 rad experienced conjunctivitis and skin erythema that resolved completely. No other effects of radiation on normal structures of the ocular adnexa were observed in the 20 patients who are alive and without signs of tumor 10-46 months with a median follow-up time of 22 months

This produces images of the treatment portals in under 10 seconds, in a digital format, facilitating rapid, quantitative image analysis. Image quality is comparable to, and at some sites improves upon, that available from film. Clinical problems in the use of megavoltage imaging include limited field of view, loss of information at the field edge due to penumbra effects, degradation of the image by bowel gas, and difficulties in the detection of soft tissue-air interfaces. Possible solutions to these problems are discussed. The imaging system has been used to assess the random errors occurring during routine para-aortic nodal irradiation. The errors detected are small, with over 95% of set-ups lying within +/- 4.5 mm of the mean daily position. No differences were detected in the magnitude of random errors between anterior and posterior treatment fields	
1059	Quantitative measurement of MLC leaf displacements using an electronic portal image device	Algorithms, Calibration, Film Dosimetry, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Uncertainty	The success of an IMRT treatment relies on the positioning accuracy of the MLC (multileaf collimator) leaves for both step-and-shoot and dynamic deliveries. In practice, however, there exists no effective and quantitative means for routine MLC QA and this has become one of the bottleneck problems in IMRT implementation. In this work we present an electronic portal image device (EPID) based method for fast and accurate measurement of MLC leaf positions at arbitrary locations within the 40 cm x 40 cm radiation field. The new technique utilizes the fact that the integral signal in a small region of interest (ROI) is a sensitive and reliable indicator of the leaf displacement. In this approach, the integral signal at a ROI was expressed as a weighted sum of the contributions from the displacements of the leaf above the point and the adjacent leaves. The weighting factors or linear coefficients of the system equations were determined by fitting the integral signal data for a group of pre-designed MLC leaf sequences to the known leaf displacements that were intentionally introduced during the creation of the leaf sequences. Once the calibration is done, the system can be used for routine MLC leaf positioning QA to detect possible leaf errors. A series of tests was carried out to examine the functionality and accuracy of the technique. Our results show that the proposed technique is potentially superior to the conventional edge-detecting approach in two aspects: (i) it deals with the problem in a systematic approach and allows us to take into account the influence of the adjacent MLC leaves effectively; and (ii) it may improve the signal-to-noise ratio and is thus capable of quantitatively measuring extremely small leaf positional displacements. Our results indicate that the technique can detect a leaf positional error as small as 0.1 mm at an arbitrary point within the field in the absence of EPID set-up error and 0.3 mm when the uncertainty is considered. Given its simplicity, efficiency and accuracy, we believe that the technique is ideally suitable for routine MLC leaf positioning QA	
2112	Value and perspectives of proton radiation therapy for limited stage prostate cancer	Dose Fractionation, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: This review article will focus on clinical results and limitations of proton beam irradiation. Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects	
1298	Biologically optimized 3-dimensional in vivo predictive assay-based radiation therapy using positron emission tomography-computerized tomography imaging. [Review] [40 refs]	Feedback, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional/mt [Methods], Light, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Sweden, Tomography,Emission-Computed/mt [Methods], Uncertainty	PET-CT is probably the ultimate tool for accurate tumor imaging and 3-dimensional in vivo predictive assay of radiation sensitivity. By imaging the tumor twice during the early course of therapy, it should be possible to quantify both the tumor responsiveness to therapy and the rate of loss of functional tumor cells using the presently derived equations. This new information is ideal for use together with biologically based therapy optimization and makes it possible accurately to quantitate the dose-response relation, at least for the bulk of the tumor cells. Since the tumor responsiveness is available after about one and a half weeks of therapy, the information is also ideal for use with adaptive therapy where all forms of deviations from the original treatment plan can be accurately corrected for since they generally influence the still functional, but mainly doomed tumor cell compartment. Thus, uncertainties such as: 1) the geometric misalignment of the therapeutic beam with the tumor, 2) deviations of the delivered dose distribution from the planned delivery whether due to 3) an erroneous treatment planning algorithm or 4) treatment equipment uncertainties and 5) deviations in the anticipated responsiveness of the tumor of the patient based on historical response data, can all be taken into account. Fortunately, when a larger tumor cell compartment than expected is seen an increased dose during the remainder of the treatment should always be delivered independently on whichever combination of the above deviations was the true reason. With high-energy photon and hadron therapy it is even possible to image the integral dose delivery in vivo during or after a treatment using PET-CT imaging. The high-energy photons above about 20 MeV produce positron emitters through photonuclear reactions in tissue which are proportional to the photon fluence and thus approximately also to the absorbed dose. Light ion beams, the ultimate radiation modality with regard to physical and biological selectivity, instead produce PET emitters through direct nuclear interactions in tissue, but can also be used as radioactive beams consisting of intrinsic PET emitters such as 8B, 11C, 13N and 15O. These radioactive beams allow more accurate imaging of the Bragg peak distribution and thus indirectly the absorbed dose. The most universal feedback for adaptive radiation therapy would then be to use the measured image of mean dose delivery during the early part of the treatment while revising the treatment plan based on the initially planned dose distribution and the radiation responsiveness of the tumor as seen after the first week or two of therapy. By this so-called BIO-ART approach (Biologically Optimized 3D in vivo predictive Assay-based Radiation Therapy) radiation therapy optimization may become an almost exact science, where the patient's true individual radiation response, considering hypoxia and general radiation resistance as well as possible dose delivery and planning errors, is taken into account.

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

The study was designed to reveal the impact of pRT on normal brain tissue metabolism, which may potentially help in delineating the target volumes for reirradiated patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Spectra of 43 patients ages 16-63 years treated with pRT for primary glial tumors in the Center of Oncology Maria Curie Memorial Institute Branch in Gliwice were analyzed. The control group consisted of spectra acquired for 30 healthy volunteers. All patients were treated with 3D conformal techniques using 6-20 MV photons to total doses of 60 Gy. Spectra were acquired from the control region before pRT and from three uninvolved regions 9-12 months after the end of pRT. Voxels were located in the region of low (<6 Gy), medium (29-39 Gy), and high radiation dose ( approximately 60 Gy). Relative intensities of the signals relating to N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), choline-based compounds, creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), mio-Inositol, lactate, and lipids were obtained. RESULTS: The spectra of "normal brain" taken 9 months after pRT are significantly different from those obtained for control volunteers and from the spectra acquired before radiotherapy. The lactate and lipids signals are very strong; however, they are not correlated with absorbed dose. NAA/Cr ratios are significantly lower than before radiotherapy even for the low-dose regions. Differences increase with radiation dose: the NAA/Cr ratio is significantly lower for the regions of brain receiving a high dose of radiation than for the low-dose areas. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of primary brain tumors (surgery + postoperative radiotherapy) causes alteration of brain metabolism, even in regions of the brain far from the postoperative tumor bed and receiving relatively low total doses of radiation. Single voxel MRS spectroscopy in vivo cannot help in delineating target volumes for secondary irradiation	
3264	Potential for therapeutic gain similar to pions by daily combinations of neutrons and low-LET radiations	Animals, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Energy Transfer, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Mesons, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Survival, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	Biological studies with negative pi mesons (pions) at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) have shown a relatively constant reduction of shoulder of the survival curve for single cell cultures and relatively constant reduction in the no response region for multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) with little change in sensitivity (or slope), in both single dose and fractionated experiments. In clinical studies, a trend toward therapeutic gain for pions has been demonstrated in patients treated at LAMPF, with marked, rapid turmor regression for relatively mild acute normal tissue injury and no untoward effects observed over 7 to 24 months. Since the pion beams used therapeutically at LAMPF are characterized by a small amount of high-linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation (in the range 10 to 20%), it is hypothesized that pion radiation as compared to x-rays increased the differential tolerance to sublethal injury in favor of normal tissues, resulting in therapeutic gain. It is further proposed that the near simultaneous application of high-LET radiation (such as neutrons) and low-LET radiation (such as x-rays) might create a bilogical situation similar to that of pion treatment, potentially resulting in therapeutic gain, although without the added benefit of dose localization obtainable with pions	
2872	The dosimetry of fixed, single source hemibody and total body irradiators. [Review] [87 refs]	Air, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiobiology, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Technology,Radiologic, Whole-Body Irradiation/is [Instrumentation], Whole-Body Irradiation/mt [Methods]	Increasingly, hemibody and total body irradiation are used to treat systemic and disseminated diseases. Certain dosimetry considerations are common to conventional treatments at short source-to-axis distances and large field treatments at extended treatment distances. These dosimetry considerations include: irradiation geometry, dose rates or outputs in the treatment plane, radiation intensity uniformity, confirmation of the dose ratio parameters such as percentage depth doses, tissue air ratios, tissue maximum ratios, and tissue phantom ratios, the surface doses and the doses in the region of build-up to maximum ionization, the exit doses, the dose prescription point or points, dose uniformity in the patient, and dose confirmation and verification. Some radiotherapists are reluctant to treat patients using large fields at extended treatment distances because they are unfamiliar with the dosimetry of such treatments. This article reviews the dosimetry and radiobiology of large field treatments at the extended treatment distances required by hemibody or total body irradiation, as performed with conventional single source teletherapy units.

The dose delivered in particle therapy can be described as the integral of fluence times the total mass stopping power over the particle energy distributions. We employed Monte Carlo simulations to explore the influence on the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the energy and the energy spread of the proton beam incident on a range modulator system. Using different beams, the conditions of beam delivery were adjusted so that similar spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) doses were delivered to a simulated water phantom. We calculated the RBE for inactivation of three different cell lines using the track structure model. The RBE depends on the details of the dose deposition and the biological characteristics of the irradiated tissue. Our calculations show that, for differing beam conditions, the corresponding differences in the total mass stopping power distributions are reflected in differences in the RBE. However, these differences are remarkable only at the very distal edge of the SOBP, for low doses, and/or for large differences in beam setup

[German]	Air, Berlin, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Rotation, Silicon, Temperature	BACKGROUND: Conformal stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy with linear accelerators and hole collimators yield a dose concentration in the target volume by rotation of the gantry. For small target volumes collimators with isocentre diameters of 4-45 mm are used. In this paper dosimetric measurements with a commercial high doped p-type silicon detector are demonstrated and compared to measurements with diamond detector and ionisation chamber. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The properties of the silicon detector SFD from Scanditronix were investigated with the radiation of a Gammatron S and a Varian 2100 CD at 6 MV. The results were compared with those of a calibrated ionisation chamber (0.3 cm3) and a diamond detector. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At the beginning the reproductibility of the registered dose and dose rate and the temperature dependence of the Si-detector were investigated at the Gammatron S. For the comparison the absorbed dose was measured with the ionisation chamber in air. The sensitivity decreases slightly with dose and dose rate. After a period of several days without radiation again higher doses were registered. The temperature dependence causes deviations of 0.25%/K. The signal-to-noise ratio and the spatial resolution were investigated with the linear accelerator. The signal-to-noise ratio is clearly lower compared with that of the diamond detector, whereas the resolution is nearly the same. CONCLUSIONS: The Si-detector is qualified for dosimetry of very small fields because of the insignificant dose and dose rate dependence and in spite of some disadvantages regarding dosimetric properties compared with the diamond detector. The advantage is the availability and the cost. Measurement with ionisation chambers are not useful for collimator diameters below 20 mm	
1614	A Monte Carlo code for a direct estimation of radiation risk	Chromosome Aberrations, Computer Simulation, Elementary Particle Interactions, Humans, Italy, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Second Primary/et [Etiology], Neutrons, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Space Flight, Water	An example of pragmatic approach for predicting mixed field effects is presented. The method was initially applied adopting the following, commonly used, assumptions: a) radiation risk (typically cancer) is correlated with chromosome aberration induction; b) radiation-induced chromosome-exchange yield can be well described by a linear-quadratic dependence on particle fluences (mostly linear with high-LET radiation), with parameters depending on particle types and energies. Information on monochromatic field radiobiological effects was integrated in a condensed-history Monte Carlo transport code (FLUKA), able to simulate nuclear interactions. The integrated code provides the chromosome aberration yield (and thus an estimation of radiation risk) in each voxel of any irradiated volume, given any external mixed-field irradiation; in the present work, the method was tested for neutron irradiation of a water phantom. FLUKA was then coupled with a geometrical human phantom provided with different radiation shielding, in order to apply this approach to estimate radiation risk in manned space missions

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1984 to 31st December 1998, 739 female patients were operated in our institution, diagnosed as having infiltrating breast cancer. One hundred and eighty-eight patients (25.43%) received conservative treatment and they were followed up until December 2003. RESULTS: Average age when diagnosed was 50.42 years old (24-87 years). 53.19% of the patients were premenopausal. After a median follow-up of 129 months (60-198 months), 13 women (6.91%) presented local -regional recurrence and the disease-free time was 48.4 months (8-108 months). Global survival rate was 83.5% and disease free survival rate was 80.85%. CONCLUSIONS: The management of choice for early stage (I and II) infiltrating breast cancer is nowadays conservative, with a low local-regional recurrence rate and survival rate that are comparable to radical mastectomy, according to the literature. It's a safe and efficient method that let us preserve the breast with a good esthetical result. In selected cases, when a regional recurrence occurs, a second conservative management is possible with a good control of the disease, although the most widely accepted treatment in these cases is total mastectomy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SAS cells transfected with mutant p53 gene (SAS/mp53) or a neo control gene (SAS/neo) were transplanted into the thigh of each nude mouse. By measuring the tumor weight (TW), tumor regrowth delay was evaluated when the relative tumor weight (RW) reached 5-fold that of the control group. Apoptosis was analyzed by immunohistochemical and ApopTag stainings. RESULTS: SAS/mp53 tumors were more resistant to X-ray irradiation than SAS/neo tumors, but not to C-beam irradiation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-beams compared to X-rays was 2.1 in SAS/neo tumors and 2.6 in SAS/mp53 tumors. Apoptotic cells were more frequently observed in SAS/neo tumors than in SAS/mp53 tumors in X-ray irradiation but not in C-beam irradiation. CONCLUSION: The radiation-induced growth inhibition of transplanted SAS cells is suggested to be p53-dependent in X-ray irradiation but not in C-beam irradiation. C-beams are proposed as being useful for cancer radiation therapy regardless of p53 gene status

1300	Investigating the TEPC radiation quality factor response for low energy accelerator based clinical applications	Algorithms, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage	The use of a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) filled with propane based tissue equivalent gas simulating a 2 microm diameter tissue sphere has been investigated to estimate the radiation quality factor of the neutron fields used in in vivo neutron activation measurements at the McMaster University 3 MV Van de Graaff accelerator. The counter response to estimate the effective quality factor based on the definitions of Q(L) provided in ICRP 26 and 60 as a function of neutron energy has been examined experimentally using monoenergetic and continuous neutron spectra in the energy range of 35 to 600 keV. In agreement with other studies, the counter failed to provide a flat R(Q) response and showed a sharp drop below 200 keV neutron energy. Development of an algorithm to evaluate the quality factors using measured dose-mean lineal energy, yD, and comparison of the algorithm with other reported algorithms and analytical methods developed for the improvement in TEPC dose equivalent response has been reported	
1519	Measurement of DNA damage induced by irradiation with gamma-rays from a TRIGA Mark II research reactor in human cells using Fast Micromethod	4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/me [Metabolism], DNA Damage, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Germany, Hela Cells, Humans, Isotopes, Mutagenicity Tests/mt [Methods], Nuclear Reactors, Particle Accelerators, Research, X-Rays	The Fast Micromethod is a novel quick and convenient microplate assay for determination of DNA single-strand breaks. This method measures the rate of unwinding of cellular DNA upon exposure to alkaline conditions using a fluorescent dye which preferentially binds to double-stranded DNA. Here we applied this method to determine the levels of DNA single-strand breaks in HeLa cells induced by y-irradiation deriving from fission isotopes and activation products at the TRIGA Mark II research reactor in Mainz. An increased strand scission factor (SSF) value, which is indicative for DNA damage, was found at doses of 1 Gy and higher. A similar increase in SSF value, which further increased in a dose-dependent manner, was found in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after irradiation with 6 MV X-rays from a linear accelerator to give a total exposure of 0.5 to 10 Gy

It was demonstrated that with an increase in the irradiation dose the number of aberrant cells and chromosome aberrations grew. A high yield of exchange type aberrations was found. The proliferative activity of cells of bone marrow decreased and its depletion occurred. The RBE coefficients of high-energy particles varied from 1.3 to 2.7 in relation to the cell type and parameters measured	
3936	Use of electrons for radiation therapy in France	Breast, Calibration, Electrons, France, Humans, Neck, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Quality Control, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization]	The development of high energy radiotherapy equipments in France between 1950 and 1990 is analyzed. The use of betatrons after a growth between 1960-1970 decreased progressively from 1975 in favour of linear accelerators (133 in 1989). Cobalt-therapy, rapidly grown up between 1960 and 1980, has reached a plateau phase with a trend to being progressively substituted by low energy linac. The dosimetric aspects are considered: calibration of electron beams, quality control and treatment planning. About 22000 cancer patients were treated in 16 Centres in 1983; of these only 23% (mean value) received electron therapy, but the number varies greatly from one center to another (9-45%). The major indications for electrons in France are: neck nodes, operated breast, internal mammary chain. The general trend is to restrict their use to lesions not deeper than 4-5 cm and first of all to employ them as a boosting treatment, after an X ray irradiation	
456	Calculation of 10 MV x-ray spectra emitted by a medical linear accelerator using the BFGS quasi-Newton method	Aluminum, Aluminum/ch [Chemistry], Humans, Models,Statistical, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Water, Water/ch [Chemistry], X-Rays	To calculate photon spectra for a 10 MV x-ray beam emitted by a medical linear accelerator, we performed numerical analysis using the aluminium transmission data obtained along the central axis of the beam under the narrow beam condition corresponding to a 3x3 cm2 field at a 100 cm distance from the source. We used the BFGS quasi-Newton method based on a general nonlinear optimization technique for the numerical analysis. The attenuation coefficients, aluminium thicknesses and measured transmission data are necessary inputs for the numerical analysis. The calculated x-ray spectrum shape was smooth in the lower to higher energy regions without any angular components. The x-ray spectrum acquired by the employed method was evaluated by comparing the measurements along the central axis percentage depth dose in a water phantom and by a Monte Carlo simulation code, the electron gamma shower code. The values of the calculated percentage depth doses for a 10x10 cm2 field at a 100 cm source-to-surface distance in a water phantom were obtained using the same geometry settings as those of the water phantom measurement. The differences in the measured and calculated values were less than +/-1.0% for a broad region from the shallow part near the surface to deep parts of up to 25 cm in the water phantom	
2049	Modification of the University of Washington Neutron Radiotherapy Facility for optimization of neutron capture enhanced fast-neutron therapy	Animals, Beryllium, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Copper, Cyclotrons, Dog Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Dogs, Equipment Design, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Glass, Hospitals,University, Humans, Image Enhancement, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung Neoplasms/ve [Veterinary], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Tungsten, Universities, Washington, Water	A modified neutron production target assembly has been developed to provide improved performance of the proton-cyclotron-based neutron radiotherapy facility at the University of Washington for applications involving neutron capture enhanced fast-neutron therapy. The new target produces a neutron beam that yields essentially the same fast-neutron physical depth-dose distribution as is produced by the current UW clinical system, but that also has an increased fraction of BNCT enhancement relative to the total therapeutic dose. The modified target is composed of a 5-millimeter layer of beryllium, followed by a 2.5-millimeter layer of tungsten, with a water-cooled copper backing. Measurements of the free-field neutron spectrum of the beam produced by the new target were performed using activation foils with a direct spectral unfolding technique. Water phantom measurements were performed using a tissue-equivalent ion chamber to characterize the fast-neutron depth-dose curve and sodium activation in soda-lime glass beads to characterize the thermal-neutron flux (and thus the expected neutron capture dose enhancement) as a function of depth. The results of the various measurements were quite consistent with expectations based on the design calculations for the modified target. The spectrum of the neutron beam produced by the new target features an enhanced low-energy flux component relative to the spectrum of the beam produced by the standard UW target. However, it has essentially the same high-energy neutron flux, with a reduced flux component in the mid-range of the energy spectrum. As a result, the measured physical depth-dose curve in a large water phantom has the same shape compared to the case of the standard UW clinical beam, but approximately twice the level of BNCT enhancement per unit background neutron dose at depths of clinical interest. In-vivo clinical testing of BNCT-enhanced fast-neutron therapy for canine lung tumors using the new beam was recently initiated	
3373	Monte Carlo simulations of the differential beam hardening effect of a flattening filter on a therapeutic x-ray beam	Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Filtration, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Technology,Radiologic, Time, Universities	A quantitative study of the differential beam hardening effect of the flattening filter on the 6-MV beam of Clinac 2100C has been conducted with Monte Carlo simulations using EGS4 code. The fluence-weighted photon energy of the unfiltered beam decreases from 1.35 MeV at central axis (CAX) to 1.22 MeV at an off-axis distance (OAD) of 20.0 cm. Compared to the unfiltered beam, the fluence-weighted photon energy of the filtered beam increases to 1.93 MeV at CAX and to 1.36 MeV at an OAD f 20.0 cm, respectively. The beam hardening effect was found to be 2.1 times higher at CAX than at an OAD of 20.0 cm. With the differential filtration of the flattening filter, the photon energy fluence reduced to 44% and 78% at CAX and an OAD of 20.0 cm respectively, resulting in the energy fluence of the filtered beam being flat from CAX to an OAD of 20.0 cm. The differential transmission ratios between the high energy and low energy photons decrease as the OAD increases. The percentage depth doses (PDDs) at field size of 10.0 cm x 10.0 cm for both the filtered and unfiltered 6-MV beams at CAX and at an OAD of 15.0 cm were calculated with a Monte Carlo technique based on the simulated spectra and fluence. The calculated PDDs were found to be consistent with the measured data for the filtered beam at CAX and an OAD of 15.0 cm. The beam quality (BQ) of the filtered beam at CAX is also higher than that of the same beam at an OAD of 15.0 cm. All the above results quantitatively demonstrate the differential beam hardening effects of a flattening filter on a therapeutic x-ray beam

1376	Quantitative comparisons of cancer induction in humans by internally deposited radionuclides and external radiation. [Review] [94 refs]	Alpha Particles, Animals, Bone Marrow, Bone Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Dogs, Energy Transfer, Humans, Incidence, Inhalation, Leukemia,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Linear Energy Transfer, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Plutonium, Plutonium/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Radium/ae [Adverse Effects], Radon, Radon/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Survivors, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Uncertainty	PURPOSE: To compare quantitative estimates of lifetime cancer risk in humans for exposures to internally deposited radionuclides and external radiation. To assess the possibility that risks from radionuclide exposures may be underestimated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Risk estimates following internal exposures can be made for a small number of alpha-particle-emitting nuclides. (1) Lung cancer in underground miners exposed by inhalation to radon-222 gas and its short-lived progeny. Studies of residential (222)Rn exposure are generally consistent with predictions from the miner studies. (2) Liver cancer and leukaemia in patients given intravascular injections of Thorotrast, a thorium-232 oxide preparation that concentrates in liver, spleen and bone marrow. (3) Bone cancer in patients given injections of radium-224, and in workers exposed occupationally to (226)Ra and (228)Ra, mainly by ingestion. (4) Lung cancer in Mayak workers exposed to plutonium-239, mainly by inhalation. Liver and bone cancers were also seen, but the dosimetry is not yet sufficiently good enough to provide quantitative estimates of risks. Comparisons can be made between risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer derived for radionuclide exposure and those derived for the A-bomb survivors, exposed mainly to low-LET (linear energy transfer) external radiation. Data from animal studies, using dogs and rodents, allow comparisons of cancer induction by a range of alpha- and beta-/gamma-emitting radionuclides. They provide information on relative biological effectiveness (RBE), dose-response relationships, dose-rate effects and the location of target cells for different malignancies. RESULTS: For lung and liver cancer, the estimated values of risk per Sv for internal exposure, assuming an RBE for alpha-particles of 20, are reasonably consistent with estimates for external exposure to low-LET radiation. This also applies to bone cancer when risk is calculated on the basis of average bone dose, but consideration of dose to target cells on bone surfaces suggests a low RBE for alpha-particles. Similarly, for leukaemia, the comparison of risks from alpha-irradiation ((232)Th and progeny) and external radiation suggest a low alpha RBE; this conclusion is supported by animal data. Risk estimates for internal exposure are dependent on the assumptions made in calculating dose. Account is taken of the distribution of radionuclides within tissues and the distribution of target cells for cancer induction. For the lungs and liver, the available human and animal data provide support for current assumptions. However, for bone cancer and leukaemia, it may be that changes are required. Bone cancer risk may be best assessed by calculating dose to a 50 micro m layer of marrow adjacent to endosteal (inner) bone surfaces rather than to a single 10 micro m cell layer as currently assumed. Target cells for leukaemia may be concentrated towards the centre of marrow cavities so that the risk of leukaemia from bone-seeking radionuclides, particularly alpha emitters, may be overestimated by the current assumption of uniform distribution of target cells throughout red bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime risk estimates considered here for exposure to internally deposited radionuclides and to external radiation are subject to uncertainties, arising from the dosimetric assumptions made, from the quality of cancer incidence and mortality data and from aspects of risk modelling; including variations in baseline rates between populations for some cancer types. Bearing in mind such uncertainties, comparisons of risk estimates for internal emitters and external radiation show good agreement for lung and liver cancers. For leukaemia, the available data suggest that the assumption of an alpha-particle RBE of 20 can result in overestimates of risk. For bone cancer, it also appears that current assumptions will overestimate risks from alpha-particle-emitting nuclides, particularly at low doses. [References: 94]	
3292	Microdosimetric specification of the radiation quality of a d(48.5)+Be fast neutron therapy beam produced by a superconducting cyclotron	Biophysics, Cyclotrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Michigan, Motion, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiometry/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Uncertainty, Water	The proportional counter microdosimetric technique has been employed to quantify variations in the quality of a d(48.5)+Be fast neutron beam passing through a homogeneous water phantom. Single event spectra have been measured as a function of spatial location in the water phantom and field size. The measured spectra have been separated into component spectra corresponding to the gamma, recoil proton and alpha plus heavy recoil ion contribution to the total absorbed dose. The total absorbed dose normalized to the "monitor units" used in daily clinical use has been calculated from the measured spectra and compared to the data measured with calibrated ion chambers. The present measurements agree with the ion chamber data to within 5%. The RBE of the neutron beam is assumed to be proportional to the microdosimetric parameter y* for the dose ranges pertinent to fractionated neutron therapy. The relative variations in y*, assumed to be representative of variations in the RBE are mapped as a function of field size and spatial location in the phantom. A variation in the RBE of about 4% for points within and 8% for points outside a 10 cm x 10 cm field is observed. The variations in the RBE within the beam are caused by an increase in the gamma component with depth. An increase in the RBE of about 4% is observed with increasing field size which is attributed to a change in the neutron spectrum. Compared to the uncertainties in the prescribed dose, associated with uncertainties in the clinically used RBE, variation in the RBE between various tissues, and other dosimetric uncertainties caused by factors such as patient inhomogeneities, patient setup errors, patient motion, etc., the measured spatial RBE variations are not considered significant enough to be incorporated into the treatment planning scheme	
1186	Comparison of a micro-multileaf collimator with a 5-mm-leaf-width collimator for intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Software, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	PURPOSE: To dosimetrically compare a micro-multileaf collimator (minimum leaf width of 3 mm) with the 5-mm-leaf multileaf collimator (MLC) of a standard linear accelerator for stereotactic conformal radiotherapy treatment of intracranial lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service

A five-field 18 MV photon treatment plan, selected to minimize lung dose, is compared with helium ions using the same field configuration. Dose volume histograms show target coverage, as well as dose delivered to critical structures lung, heart, mediastinum, and spinal cord. Although both helium ions and photons deliver approximately the same lung dose for this treatment plan, radiation to the heart and spinal cord from this field arrangement is significantly reduced with the helium ion beam. The concentration of dose at the tumor site, while sparing surrounding normal tissue, is characteristic of charged particle therapy, particularly with light ions, which includes particles with Z from that of protons (Z = 1) through that of neon (Z = 10)

In order to minimise the workload related to the quality assurance of the IMRT fields, we have explored the possibility of using a commercially available aSi portal imager for absolute dosimetric verification of the delivery of dynamic IMRT fields. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the basic dosimetric characteristics of an aSi portal imager (aS500, Varian Medical Systems), using an acquisition mode especially developed for portal dose (PD) integration during delivery of a-static or dynamic-radiation field. Secondly, the dose calculation algorithm of a commercially available treatment planning system (Cadplan, Varian Medical Systems) was modified to allow prediction of the PD image, i.e. to compare the intended fluence distribution with the fluence distribution as actually delivered by the dynamic multileaf collimator. Absolute rather than relative dose prediction was applied. The PD image prediction was compared to the corresponding acquisition for several clinical IMRT fields by means of the gamma evaluation method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The acquisition mode is accurate in integrating all PD over a wide range of monitor units, provided detector saturation is avoided. Although the dose deposition behaviour in the portal image detector is not equivalent to the dose to water measurements, it is reproducible and self-consistent, lending itself to quality assurance measurements. Gamma evaluations of the predicted versus measured PD distribution were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria for all clinical IMRT fields, i.e. allowing a dose difference of 3% of the local field dose in combination with a distance to agreement of 3 mm

METHODS: Forty patients with a total of 47 metastatic brain tumors were evaluated. The primary lesion was identified in all cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery was effective in 37 lesions. All patients were examined using Gd-enhanced MR imaging before and after SRS. Thalium-201 chloride was administered to 27 patients with 34 tumors and SPECT images were obtained. Proton MR spectroscopy was performed in 36 patients who harbored 43 tumors. On Gd-enhanced MR images, a decrease in the volume of the Gd-enhanced lesion and a change in the enhanced effect in the lesion after treatment were recognized as showing the effectiveness of SRS between 1 and 3 months or more (mean 8.54 +/- 3.58 weeks). In 201TlCl-SPECT studies, the ratio of lesion to normal brain decreased from 2 weeks to 2 months (mean 5.03 +/- 2.77 weeks) after radiosurgery. On 1H-MR spectroscopy images a high choline (Cho) peak and a lipid-dominant (Lip) peak were observed in 25 lesions and a high Cho peak and a lactate-dominant (Lac) peak were observed in 12 lesions before SRS. A decrease in the Cho peak, a disappearance of the Lac peak, and an increase in the Lip peak were observed between 1 week and 1 month (mean 2.76 +/- 1.62 weeks) after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on histopathological findings obtained at autopsy or at surgery, we assume that a high Cho peak may be observed in viable tumor tissue and a Lip peak in areas of necrosis. The results indicate that 1H-MR spectroscopy is potentially a more sensitive tool in evaluating the response to SRS than 201TlCl-SPECT or Gd-enhanced MR imaging and that it can be used earlier for this purpose than those other imaging methods

[German]	Cell Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Efficiency, Humans, Lung, Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Neutrons, Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Skin, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Survival, Survival Rate, Weights and Measures	The Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of radiation with different LET has to be recognized in the planning of radiation therapy especially if one type of radiation should be replaced by another type or if both should be used within the same irradiation course. In radiation therapy it is suitable to consider the RBE in connection with dose dependent cell survival rates. These rates can be described by means of corresponding mathematical models. A simple way to calculate the RBE on the basis of the modern LQ-model is demonstrated. In that procedure the alpha/beta-ratios which are known at least approximatively for many organs and tissues can be used. The proposed method is demonstrated for the human skin and lung. For these organs we obtained RBE ranges from 3.4 to 1.2 and from 3.8 to 0.8, respectively, considering increasing doses. Thereby, for the lung it can be observed that the dose dependency of the RBE for small doses is especially strong. The obtained results are in good coincidence with experiences in clinical practice	
2683	An assessment of the Basic Treatment Equivalent (BTE) model as measure of radiotherapy workload	Australia, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Efficiency, Hospital Departments/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Methods, Models,Theoretical, New South Wales, Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization], Time, Workload	Current methods of linear accelerator workload analysis in radiation oncology use patients per hour or fields per hour as the basic unit of measurement but fail to take account of the variations in complexity of different treatment techniques. The Basic Treatment Equivalent (BTE) model of productivity assessment has been derived as a potentially better measure of workload because it includes a complexity factor. This model has now been tested prospectively in ten radiation oncology departments in New South Wales and compared with the numbers of fields and patients per hour. Over a 4-week period there were 50,115 fields administrated in 18,466 fractions in 441 hours of machine time in ten radiation oncology departments. The average productivity results for all departments were 4.18 patients, 11.25 fields and 5.66 BTE per hour. When compared with patients per hour and fields per hour, there was less variability of BTE per patient per hour in all departments, suggesting that most departments deliver radiation therapy in a consistent way, which is not appropriately reflected in the numbers of fields or patients per hour. Departments that were able to treat a high number of patients or fields per hour were able to do so because they used less complicated techniques or had a less complicated casemix of patients. The BTE model allows for variations in the complexity of treatment techniques, is simple to apply, and is reproducible under different conditions in different departments. Following revision of the model, an Australasian study is now proposed. The confirmation of our findings will have significant implications for resource utilization comparisons, patient time allocations, waiting list estimates and cost-benefit analysis	
2161	Dose calculations for asymmetric fields defined by independent collimators using symmetric field data	Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Reproduction	Several methods have been developed for the dosimetry of asymmetric radiation fields formed by independently moving collimator jaws. Three of these methods, based on different principles and modified to comply with our set of available data, are utilized for the calculation of asymmetric field dose profiles. All three methods use output factors and per cent depth doses or tissue maximum ratios of symmetric fields. In the first method, calculation of the off-centre ratio (OCR) of the asymmetric field is based on the symmetric field from which the asymmetric is originated, by setting the one jaw in an asymmetrical position. In the second method the OCR of the symmetric field is used for the OCR calculation of the asymmetric field of the same size; whereas the third method does not allow for the asymmetric OCR calculation. The results obtained using data for the 6 MV photon beam of a Philips SL-20 linear accelerator indicate that both the first and second method can accurately reproduce asymmetric field profiles from symmetric field data; the third method does not allow for penumbra reproduction, but it is accurate at the central part of the asymmetric field. The problems encountered in the application of the three methods are reported and their accuracy is compared	
4544	Electron contamination due to Lucite in a 45-MV photon beam	Electrons, Humans, Lead, Methylmethacrylate, Methylmethacrylates, Particle Accelerators, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards]	The presence of the Lucite blocking tray in a 45-MV betatron beam leads to a considerable loss in the skin-sparing properties of this unit. Measurements conducted with a parallel-plate chamber show that the surface dose is approximately doubled (up to 58% of the maximum absorbed dose) and the depth of maximum dose is reduced by as much as 1.5 cm by the Lucite. These results suggest that separate dosimetry data should be kept for blocked and unblocked fields. The penetration of the electron contamination to the open field depth of maximum dose can lead to erroneous results if attenuation measurements are made at that depth. Studies of the effect of the lead sheet and leaded acrylic on the surface dose showed that under normal circumstances the presence of high-Z materials increases the surface dose, hence these materials cannot in general be used as electron filters on very high energy x-ray units. A Luciteless blocking tray with universal triangular corner blocks has been designed for use in special cases requiring a reduced surface dose	
286	Further radiobiologic modeling of palliative radiotherapy: use of virtual trials	Algorithms, Cell Count, Clinical Trials as Topic, Disease Progression, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Ions, Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Linear Models, Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Palliative Care/mt [Methods], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Tolerance, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Remission Induction, Retreatment, Time Factors, Tumor Burden	PURPOSE: To study duration of response in palliative radiotherapy in a population of tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Models of dynamic changes in cell number with time were used to develop a function for the remission time (T(rem)) after palliative radiotherapy: [See Equation], where BED is the biologically effective dose, t(1) the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of radiotherapy), K the daily BED repopulation equivalent, alpha the linear radiosensitivity parameter in the linear-quadratic model, and z the tumor regression rate. RESULTS: Simulations of clinical trials show marked variations in remission statistics depending on the tumor characteristics and are highly compatible with the results of clinical trials. Dose escalation produces both a higher proportion and extended duration of remissions, especially in tumors with high alpha/beta ratios and K values, but the predicted dose responses of acute and late side effects show that caution is necessary. The prospect of using particle beam therapy to reduce normal tissue radiation exposures or using hypoxic sensitizers to improve the tumor cell kill might significantly improve the results of palliative radiotherapy in carefully selected patients and could also be used for safer palliative re-treatments in patients with the potential for prolonged survival. The effect of tumor heterogeneity in determining palliative responses probably exceeds that in radical radiotherapy; as few as 100 patients in each treatment arm produce statistically unreliable results. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual trials of palliative radiotherapy can be useful to test the effects of competing schedules and better determine future strategies, including improved design of clinical trials as well as combinations of radiotherapy with other anticancer modalities	
3424	Critical evaluation of bispecific antibodies as targeting agents for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors	Alpha Particles, Animals, Antibodies,Bispecific/me [Metabolism], Antibodies,Bispecific/tu [Therapeutic Use], Antibody Affinity, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cell Line, Energy Transfer, Feasibility Studies, Glioblastoma/me [Metabolism], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/me [Metabolism], Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/me [Metabolism], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Mice, Mice,Inbred BALB C, Mice,Nude, Molecular Weight, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Ohio, Radioisotopes, Rats, Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture reaction that occurs when 10B, a stable isotope, is irradiated with low energy neutrons to produce high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particles and recoiling 7Li nuclei. In order for BNCT to be successful in treating cancer, approximately 10(9) boron atoms must be delivered per tumor cell to sustain a lethal 10B, (n,a) 7Li capture reaction. In the present study, we have produced and characterized a bispecific antibody (BsAbB8), which was reactive with both human glioma and melanoma cell lines, as well as with a variety of polyhedral borane anions (PBA). The affinity constants (KA) of BsAb-B8 with D-54 MG and M21 cells were 3.49 and 2.57 x 10(8) M-1, respectively, which were almost identical to those of the parental mAb 9.2.27 with these cell lines. In vivo tumor localizing properties were studied in nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of the D-54 MG glioma. Following intravenous injection of 131I-labeled BsAb-B8, 3.4 +/- 0.2% of the injected dose/g was detected in the tumor at 24 hours, and then slowly declined to 2.0 +/- 0.4% at 96 hours compared to 1.34 +/- 0.07% and 0.03 +/- 0.01%, respectively, for normal mouse IgG. Based on the assumption that all the tumor cell antigenic receptor sites could be saturated, the following calculations have been carried out. The maximum concentration of BsAb-B8 that could be delivered to 1 g of D-54 MG glioma cells would be 99.6 micrograms, which could bind 71.7 ng of a PBA. However, since at least 500 x more boron would be required per gram of tumor to sustain a lethal 10B (n,a) 7Li capture reaction, a macromolecule containing -10(3)-10(4) boron atoms rather than a low molecular weight PBA would be required to deliver this amount. Such boron containing macromolecules have been synthesized by us, and future studies should provide information on the feasibility of using them in combination with BsAb-B8 to deliver the requisite amount of 10B	
1317	Optimization of radiation therapy for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas with infiltration of the skull base using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a carbon ion boost	Carbon, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Ethmoid Sinus, Germany, Humans, Ions, Jaw Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lead, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit	
85	Clinical use of a simulation-multileaf collimator	Calibration, Computer Simulation, Female, Germany, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], X-Ray Film	BACKGROUND: At the University of Lubeck, radiotherapy is delivered by a 6/18-MV linear accelerator. Using the integrated multileaf collimator, irradiation of individually shaped treatment fields is possible in place of alloy blocks. Due to unsatisfactory pretherapeutic review of the radiation-field-specific multileaf collimator (MLC) configuration, we developed a simulation-multileaf collimator (SMLC) and assessed its feasibility at different tumor sites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SMLC is made of a perspex carrier with 52 horizontal sliding leaves. The position of each leaf is calculated by a 3D treatment-planning computer. The technician manually adjusts the leaves according to the beams-eye-view plot of the planning computer. Consequently, the SMLC is mounted on the therapy simulator at a distance of 64.8 cm from the focus. The treatment fields and the position of the leaves are documented by X-ray films. RESULTS: Using the SMLC, radiation oncologists are able to review exactly the leaf configuration of each MLC-shaped radiation field and to correlate the MLC-shaped radiation field with the treated volume, the organs at risk and the port films acquired by the Portal Vision system. CONCLUSION: The SMLC is a new tool to review radiation planning that uses an MLC in daily routine. The use of the SMLC improves the documentation and the quality assurance. It accelerates the treatment field review at the linear accelerator by comparing the SMLC simulator films with the portal images	
4728	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy and image-guided radiation therapy: small clinic implementation. [Review] [43 refs]	Ambulatory Care Facilities, Ambulatory Care Facilities/st [Standards], Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oregon, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Patient Selection, Phantoms,Imaging/st [Standards], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/st [Standards], Science, United States, Universities	In a small clinic with a small patient base, the implementation of IMRT/IGRT should be slow, measured, and meticulous. Most radiation oncologists in the United States have had no formal training in IMRT/IGRT because the modalities are so new. Proper patient selection and a team effort among the clinician, physicist, dosimetrist, and therapist are thus all the more critical.The clinician in the small clinic can take comfort in remembering that the technologies are new, but the principles of good radiation medicine are not. With patient selection, a team approach, and publication of data and maturation of the literature, IMRT/IGRT will become the new standard of care in academic centers, large private clinics, and small clinics alike.

256	Carbon ion radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer using a regimen of four fractions during 1 week.[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/sc [Secondary], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Adenosquamous/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Adenosquamous/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Large Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Large Cell/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/et [Etiology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Staging, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND: A phase I/II study was first conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 1994 to 1999 to determine the optimal dose. On the basis on the results, a phase II study using a regimen of four fractions during 1 week was performed. The purpose of the present study was to determine the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2003, 79 patients with 80 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA NSCLC and 60.0 GyE for stage IB NSCLC in four fractions during 1 week, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.8 years. Sixty-two (78.5%) of these patients were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The data were statistically processed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years or until death, with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months, ranging from 2.5 to 72.2 months. The local control rate for all patients was 90% (T1: 98%, T2: 80%). The patients' 5-year lung cancer-specific survival rate was 68% (IA: 87%, IB: 42%). The overall survival was 45% (IA: 62%, IB: 25%). Half of the deaths were attributable to intercurrent diseases. No toxic reactions in the lung greater than grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion beam radiotherapy with a regimen of four fractions during 1 week has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients	
1139	Fractionated, stereotactic proton beam treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations	Adult, Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Dose Fractionation, Edema/et [Etiology], Epilepsy/et [Etiology], Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pa [Pathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Sweden, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Women	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the therapeutic efficiency and adverse effects of stereotactic proton beam treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated in Uppsala during 1991-97 were included (men = 14, women = 12; mean age = 39, range = 23-64). The nidus volumes ranged from 0.3 to 102 ml (mean = 24, median = 13). The follow-up included clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (and/or computed tomography) every 6-12 months for 3 years and final angiography. RESULTS: The volume changes at final follow-up in AVMs >25 ml were -89, -85, -44, -29, -7, 0, 0, +5 and +18 (%); in AVMs 11-24 ml, -100, -100, -97, -92 and 0 (%); and in AVMs <10 ml, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, -99, -98, -50, -0 and +40 (%). Two patients were lost to follow-up due to cerebral haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. Radiology displayed significant perifocal oedema in one patient and slight oedema in four patients. Of nine patients with epilepsy, seven became seizure-free after therapy while two continued to suffer from seizures. CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation is successful in a relatively high proportion of intermediate and large-sized cerebral AVMs. The adverse effects are acceptable. The advantage of proton treatment compared with gamma knife and LINAC stereotactic irradiation is that protons can irradiate even large volumes with a very sharp dose profile against normal surroundings. Thus, proton beam irradiation is a valuable option in the treatment of AVMs larger than 10 ml	
737	Boron neutron capture therapy of cancer: current status and future prospects. [Review] [208 refs]	Alpha Particles, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/td [Trends], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Europe, Forecasting, Head, Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Liver, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Radiation, Research, Safety, Time, Treatment Outcome, United States	BACKGROUND: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear reaction that occurs when boron-10 is irradiated with low-energy thermal neutrons to yield high linear energy transfer alpha particles and recoiling lithium-7 nuclei. Clinical interest in BNCT has focused primarily on the treatment of high-grade gliomas and either cutaneous primaries or cerebral metastases of melanoma, most recently, head and neck and liver cancer. Neutron sources for BNCT currently are limited to nuclear reactors and these are available in the United States, Japan, several European countries, and Argentina. Accelerators also can be used to produce epithermal neutrons and these are being developed in several countries, but none are currently being used for BNCT. BORON DELIVERY AGENTS: Two boron drugs have been used clinically, sodium borocaptate (Na(2)B(12)H(11)SH) and a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine called boronophenylalanine. The major challenge in the development of boron delivery agents has been the requirement for selective tumor targeting to achieve boron concentrations ( approximately 20 microg/g tumor) sufficient to deliver therapeutic doses of radiation to the tumor with minimal normal tissue toxicity. Over the past 20 years, other classes of boron-containing compounds have been designed and synthesized that include boron-containing amino acids, biochemical precursors of nucleic acids, DNA-binding molecules, and porphyrin derivatives. High molecular weight delivery agents include monoclonal antibodies and their fragments, which can recognize a tumor-associated epitope, such as epidermal growth factor, and liposomes. However, it is unlikely that any single agent will target all or even most of the tumor cells, and most likely, combinations of agents will be required and their delivery will have to be optimized. CLINICAL TRIALS: Current or recently completed clinical trials have been carried out in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The vast majority of patients have had high-grade gliomas. Treatment has consisted first of "debulking" surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by BNCT at varying times after surgery. Sodium borocaptate and boronophenylalanine administered i.v. have been used as the boron delivery agents. The best survival data from these studies are at least comparable with those obtained by current standard therapy for glioblastoma multiforme, and the safety of the procedure has been established. CONCLUSIONS: Critical issues that must be addressed include the need for more selective and effective boron delivery agents, the development of methods to provide semiquantitative estimates of tumor boron content before treatment, improvements in clinical implementation of BNCT, and a need for randomized clinical trials with an unequivocal demonstration of therapeutic efficacy. If these issues are adequately addressed, then BNCT could move forward as a treatment modality. [References: 208]

A combined CP/CPMG multi-echo, multislice sequence was used to measure T1 and T2 in each pixel with an uncertainty not exceeding 10%. In a prospective clinical study, 12 patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors were investigated. For each ROI in the calculated T1 and T2 parameter images, texture parameters originating from the grey level distribution, the gradient distribution, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the grey level runlength histogram were used for classification and discrimination between tissues. All regions corresponding to the normal brain tissue (white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid) were successfully discriminated from each other as well as from the pathological tissue parts (edema and tumor). The classification of 10 edematous and 8 tumorous tissue regions yielded only one misclassification. Together with additional rules, these discrimination rules formed the knowledge base of an expert system for segmentation of the brain images. In cases of tumors without Gd-DTPA contrast medium uptake or in cases of Gd-DTPA contraindication, segmentated images can help solve nontrivial diagnostical problems such as delineating the target volume in radiation therapy	
2196	Induction of a bystander mutagenic effect of alpha particles in mammalian cells	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Animals, Bystander Effect, Cell Line, Cell Nucleus/de [Drug Effects], Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], CHO Cells, Cricetinae, DNA, Humans, Incidence, Mutagenesis/de [Drug Effects], Mutagenesis/re [Radiation Effects], Mutagens/pd [Pharmacology], Mutation, Public Health, Radiation, Research, Universities, X-Rays	Ever since the discovery of X-rays was made by Rontgen more than a hundred years ago, it has always been accepted that the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation such as mutation and carcinogenesis are attributable mainly to direct damage to DNA. Although evidence based on microdosimetric estimation in support of a bystander effect appears to be consistent, direct proof of such extranuclear/extracellular effects are limited. Using a precision charged particle microbeam, we show here that irradiation of 20% of randomly selected A(L) cells with 20 alpha particles each results in a mutant fraction that is 3-fold higher than expected, assuming no bystander modulation effect. Furthermore, analysis by multiplex PCR shows that the types of mutants induced are significantly different from those of spontaneous origin. Pretreatment of cells with the radical scavenger DMSO had no effect on the mutagenic incidence. In contrast, cells pretreated with a 40 microM dose of lindane, which inhibits cell-cell communication, significantly decreased the mutant yield. The doses of DMSO and lindane used in these experiments are nontoxic and nonmutagenic. We further examined the mutagenic yield when 5-10% of randomly selected cells were irradiated with 20 alpha particles each. Results showed, likewise, a higher mutant yield than expected assuming no bystander effects. Our studies provide clear evidence that irradiated cells can induce a bystander mutagenic response in neighboring cells not directly traversed by alpha particles and that cell-cell communication process play a critical role in mediating the bystander phenomenon	
1215	Near simultaneous computed tomography image-guided stereotactic spinal radiotherapy: an emerging paradigm for achieving true stereotaxy	Equipment Design, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Immobilization, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Respiration, Rotation, Spinal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stereotaxic Techniques, Supine Position, Texas, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Vacuum	PURPOSE: To report treatment setup data from an emerging technique using near-simultaneous computed tomography (CT) image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of spinal and paraspinal tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A targeting system that integrates a CT-on-rails scanner with a linear accelerator (LINAC) was evaluated in the lead-in portion of a Phase I/II protocol for treating patients with paraspinal metastases. Patients were immobilized in supine position by a moldable body cushion vacuum wrapped with a plastic fixation sheet. Planning CT and immediately repeated CT were performed on the LINAC/CT-on-rails unit to assess respiratory-related vertebral body motion. Coplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using 7-9 beams was used to deliver 30 Gy in five fractions to the target volume, while limiting the spinal cord dose to <10 Gy. Pretreatment CT scans were fused with the planning CT scans to determine the correct target isocenter by accounting for any translational and roll (axial) rotational discrepancies from the planning CT. (Corrections caused by yaw and pitch rotations have not yet been implemented.) The reproducibility of the treatment isocenter as compared with the planned isocenter was measured with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), portal film imaging, and immediate post-treatment verification CT scans. Phantom measurements were taken for dose verification for each IMRT plan. RESULTS: Based on a total of 36 CT scans (3 for planning, 3 for respiration study, 15 pretreatment, and 15 post-treatment) from 3 patients, no respiration-associated vertebral body motion was seen. A comparison of the corrected daily anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) digital portal images with the planning AP and LAT DRRs confirmed that the isocenter setup accuracy for the 15 treatments was within 1 mm of the planning isocenter. The results from the immediate post-treatment CT scans reconfirmed the findings from the portal images and verified the absence of spinal movement during the treatment. The ion-chamber measurement for the high-dose region was within 2% of the planning dose for three patient treatment plans. Film dose measurement in an IMRT quality assurance phantom demonstrated good agreement from 90% to 30% isodose lines between the planned and measured results. CONCLUSION: Preliminary experience suggests that the near-simultaneous CT image-guided verification technique can be used as a new platform technology for extracranial applications of stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery to spinal and paraspinal tumors	
1366	What can we expect from dose escalation using proton beams?	Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, X-Rays	It has been demonstrated without doubt in the literature, including elsewhere in this issue, that much better conformal dose distributions in radiation therapy can be obtained with proton beams than with photons (X-rays) or electrons. It is also clear that this remains entirely true--for the fundamental reason of particle range--even after the latest and projected developments in computer-generated IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) photon dose escalation are fully considered. We consider several examples of tumour dose-response curves that illustrate the quite large gains to be obtained when dose escalation can be achieved, if normal tissue complications can also be avoided. Two contrasting types of tumour are considered in detail, prostate tumours and non-small-cell lung carcinomas. There is a considerable way to go yet to achieve really high non-recurrence rates, especially in the lung tumours. Proton beams would make this progress much safer and more effective than any variants with photons	
2389	Optimal radiographic magnification for portal imaging	Canada, Humans, London, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiography/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Television	Two approaches to estimate the optimal radiographic magnification for a TV camera-based portal imaging system and portal films have been used. The first approach optimizes signal transfer while the second optimizes signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) transfer. In order to perform these optimization calculations, the physical characteristics of the imaging system (modulation transfer function and noise power spectrum) as well as the sizes of the radiation sources of our medical linear accelerators have been measured. Using these data, the optimal magnification considering signal transfer alone (M signal) has been calculated to range between 2.0 and 2.3 for the TV camera-based imaging system and is about 1.0 for portal films. Conversely, the optimal magnification considering SNR transfer (MSNR) has been calculated to range between 1.5 and 1.7 for the TV camera-based imaging system and is about 1.0 for portal films. The results suggest that most portal imaging systems are operated close to their optimal radiographic magnification	
905	Developments in the management of uveal melanoma. [Review] [62 refs]	Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Brachytherapy, Diagnostic Techniques,Ophthalmological, Eye Enucleation, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Melanoma/di [Diagnosis], Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Neoplasm Metastasis, Probability, Prospective Studies, Radiotherapy, Research, Survival Rate, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	Uveal melanomas threaten visual loss, enucleation, and death from metastatic disease. Most patients present because of symptoms, but failures of detection and diagnosis still occur commonly. Treatments aimed at avoiding enucleation include: plaque, proton beam or stereotactic radiotherapy; trans-scleral or trans-retinal local resection; and transpupillary thermotherapy. Increasingly, different modalities are being used in combination. The ocular outcomes are related to tumour size, location, spread and cell type. Metastatic disease occurs in many patients and is related to factors such as tumour dimensions, ciliary body involvement, cell type, extravascular matrix patterns and cytogenetics. Abnormalities related to chromosomes 3, 6 and 8 are strongly related to tumour behaviour, for the first time enabling survival probability to be estimated with a high degree of reliability in an individual patient. This enables high-risk individuals to be targeted for screening while providing reassurance to those with a minimal chance of developing metastatic disease. Such targeting would allow selection of patients for adjuvant systemic therapy, should a suitable treatment become available, and would also facilitate the evaluation of such treatment by increasing the statistical power of any randomized prospective study. The high mortality in patients with monosomy 3 melanoma suggests that in these patients ocular treatment is only palliative. Cytogenetic studies suggest that some melanomas may never develop any metastatic potential and if these impressions are confirmed by further studies, then in these patients the main priority of treatment would be to conserve vision.

647	A pencil beam algorithm for intensity modulated proton therapy derived from Monte Carlo simulations	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Germany, Humans, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation	A pencil beam algorithm as a component of an optimization algorithm for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is presented. The pencil beam algorithm is tuned to the special accuracy requirements of IMPT, where in heterogeneous geometries both the position and distortion of the Bragg peak and the lateral scatter pose problems which are amplified by the spot weight optimization. Heterogeneity corrections are implemented by a multiple raytracing approach using fluence-weighted sub-spots. In order to derive nuclear interaction corrections, Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The contribution of long ranged products of nuclear interactions is taken into account by a fit to the Monte Carlo results. Energy-dependent stopping power ratios are also implemented. Scatter in optional beam line accessories such as range shifters or ripple filters is taken into account. The collimator can also be included, but without additional scattering. Finally, dose distributions are benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations, showing 3%/1 mm agreement for simple heterogeneous phantoms. In the case of more complicated phantoms, principal shortcomings of pencil beam algorithms are evident. The influence of these effects on IMPT dose distributions is shown in clinical examples	
685	Radiation necrosis versus glioma recurrence: conventional MR imaging clues to diagnosis	Aged, Biopsy, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Corpus Callosum/pa [Pathology], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Recurrence	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging findings are considered to be inadequate for reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with glioma. Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHODS: MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a "spreading wavefront" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy

Since it has been postulated that 1-2% of the composition of cosmic rays contain 56Fe particles of heavy particle irradiation, there may be significant CNS effects on astronauts on long-term space flights which could produce behavioral changes that could be expressed during the mission or at some time after the return. These, when combined with other effects such as weightlessness and exposure to proton irradiations may even supercede mutagenic effects. It is suggested that by determining mechanistic relationships that might exist between aging and irradiation it may be possible to determine the common factor(s) involved in both perturbations and develop procedures to offset their deleterious effects. For example, one method that has been effective is nutritional modification. [References: 72]	
2944	Pilot study of monoclonal antibody localization in subcutaneous and intracranial lung tumor xenografts after proton irradiation	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/sc [Secondary], Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal, Body Weight, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoembryonic Antigen/an [Analysis], Carcinoembryonic Antigen/bi [Biosynthesis], Carcinoembryonic Antigen/im [Immunology], Cell Line, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, India, Indium Radioisotopes, Indium Radioisotopes/du [Diagnostic Use], Indium Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Necrosis, Organ Size, Oxygen, Phagocytes/me [Metabolism], Pilot Projects, Protons, Radiation, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes, Rats, Rats,Nude, Research, Respiratory Burst, Spleen/pa [Pathology], Superoxides/an [Analysis], Superoxides/me [Metabolism], Tissue Distribution, Transplantation,Heterologous, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities	The purpose of this study was to determine if proton irradiation can increase the localization of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MAb) in subcutaneous (s.c.) or intracranial (i.c.) human lung tumors xenotransplanted in athymic rats. Rats with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing (NCI-H441) tumors were irradiated using 3 different proton time-dose regimens, followed by 111In-ZCE025, an anti-CEA MAb, which was injected 2 hr after the last dose of irradiation, and the animals were euthanized 3 days later for biodistribution and other assays. Proton irradiation at 10 gray (Gy) as a single dose or in 2 Gy fractions given on 5 consecutive days increased the uptake of 111In-ZCE025 into s.c. tumors by 292% and 182%, respectively, compared to nonirradiated controls. No enhancement in radiolabeled MAb delivery was seen after hemibrain irradiation in animals with i.c. tumors. Histopathological examination of both implantation sites showed a viable poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a decrease in blood vessel density, a decrease in mitotic activity, and an increase in areas of necrosis following irradiation as compared with adjacent nonirradiated tissue. CEA expression was generally maintained in vivo in that the marker was detectable in the tumor, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. Oxygen radical production by peripheral blood cells from s.c. and i.c. tumor-bearing rats exhibited strikingly different patterns of responsiveness. I.c. injected animals were 24% lighter than their s.c. injected counterparts, but no neurological signs of tumor progression were noted. The results indicate that proton irradiation can be used effectively to increase the delivery of radiolabeled MAb to s.c. implanted human lung tumor xenografts. However, in order to accomplish this in the brain, other radiation time-dose schedules and treatments may be needed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients (48 lesions) and nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were applied in the carbon dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 gray equivalents (GyE) by a 10% increment and from 68.4 to 79.2GyE by a 5% increment, respectively. The radiation target consisted of primary tumor. Image analysis of the patients with local recurrence was systematically performed after the treatment by focusing attention on the enhanced thin slice CT images of the primary lesion. By superimposing the dose distribution on the planning CT image and marking the anatomically identified loci of recurrence, it was possible to establish the relationship between the dose distribution and the incipient loci of recurrence and to classify the recurrence patterns from the differences in the recurrence loci. RESULTS: Local recurrence was found in 19 (23.2%) out of a total of 82 lesions. It is possible to distinguish between three recurrence patterns: Pattern 1 representing marginal recurrence and patterns 2a and 2b, which are both instances of in-field recurrence. In pattern 1, four recurrences take place from a region on the upper tumor margin. In pattern 2a, 13 recurrences take place from the center of the tumor. In pattern 2b, two recurrences take place from the near-center of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: For the 15 in-field recurrence lesions (patterns 2a and 2b) after excluding the four marginal recurrence lesions (patterns 1), we have established that the local control shows dose-dependence. Based on this, we have determined the optimal therapeutic dose	
1497	Three-dimensional intrafractional movement of prostate measured during real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy in supine and prone treatment positions	Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Fourier Analysis, Gold, Humans, Japan, Male, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prone Position, Prostate, Prostate/re [Radiation Effects], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Supine Position, Time, Uncertainty	PURPOSE: To quantify three-dimensional (3D) movement of the prostate gland with the patient in the supine and prone positions and to analyze the movement frequency for each treatment position. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) system was developed to identify the 3D position of a 2-mm gold marker implanted in the prostate 30 times/s using two sets of fluoroscopic images. The linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the gold marker was located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. Ten patients with prostate cancer treated with RTRT were the subjects of this study. The coordinates of the gold marker were recorded every 0.033 s during RTRT in the supine treatment position for 2 min. The patient was then moved to the prone position, and the marker was tracked for 2 min to acquire data regarding movement in this position. Measurements were taken 5 times for each patient (once a week); a total of 50 sets for the 10 patients was analyzed. The raw data from the RTRT system were filtered to reduce system noise, and the amplitude of movement was then calculated. The discrete Fourier transform of the unfiltered data was performed for the frequency analysis of prostate movement. RESULTS: No apparent difference in movement was found among individuals. The amplitude of 3D movement was 0.1-2.7 mm in the supine and 0.4-24 mm in the prone positions. The amplitude in the supine position was statistically smaller in all directions than that in the prone position (p < 0.0001). The amplitude in the craniocaudal and AP directions was larger than in the left-right direction in the prone position (p < 0.0001). No characteristic movement frequency was detected in the supine position. The respiratory frequency was detected for all patients regarding movement in the craniocaudal and AP directions in the prone position. The results of the frequency analysis suggest that prostate movement is affected by the respiratory cycle and is influenced by bowel movement in the prone position. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have confirmed that internal organ motion is less frequent in the supine position than in the prone position in the treatment of prostate cancer. RTRT would be useful in reducing uncertainty due to the effects of the respiratory cycle, especially in the prone position	
1256	Low-dose radiosurgery for benign intracranial lesions	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy Dosage, Treatment Outcome	This study assesses the efficacy and neurotoxicity of radiosurgical treatment of benign intracranial tumors using a linear accelerator, with relatively low dose and homogeneous dosimetry. Between June 1998 and July 2000, 27 patients were treated for benign lesions with radiosurgery using a 6-MV linear accelerator-based X-knife system and circular collimators. The lesions included schwannoma, meningioma, papillary cyst adenoma, and hemangioblastoma. Five patients had tissue diagnosis. The mean peripheral dose to the tumor margin was 12.8 Gy. The mean dose to the isocenter was 16.3 Gy. One to five isocenters were used to treat these lesions, with a mean of 10 arcs per isocenter and mean collimator size of 1.25 cm. Follow-up information was available on all patients, with a mean follow-up duration of 33 months. Six patients (22%) had improved symptoms and 21 (78%) had stable symptoms. Eight patients (30%) had regression of tumor and 19 had stable disease (70%). No patient had tumor progression, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade III or IV toxicity did not occur in any patients. In 3 patients (11%), RTOG grade I or grade II neurotoxicity developed. Of these, one patient had worsening of a preexisting VIIth nerve deficit that required temporary oral methylprednisolone, and in two patients a mild trigeminal deficit developed that did not require any medical intervention. Low-dose homogeneous radiosurgery using a linear accelerator is an effective treatment for benign intracranial tumors. If lower, more homogeneous radiation doses produce responses as durable as higher doses, then toxicity might be further reduced

3095	Characteristics of the 6-MV photon beam produced by a dual energy linear accelerator	Biophysics, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Water	Clinical dosimetry data are presented for the lower-energy x-ray beam of a Varian Clinac 1800 linear accelerator. This beam has comparable characteristics to single energy linear accelerators with the same stated 6-MV x-ray energy. The nominal beam energy was found to be 5.3 +/- 0.3 MV on the central axis. Beam quality expressed in terms of half-value layer in water was found to vary by less than 10% over the entire field. The surface doses are only slightly, but consistently, larger than those reported in the literature for other 6-MV linacs. Dosimetric results presented include central axis percentage depth dose (% DD) and tissue-maximum ratio (TMR), surface and buildup doses, output factors, and inverse square law applicability. The flatness and symmetry characteristics are within the manufacturer's specifications for both large and small fields

Similarly, new developments in radiation oncology have helped improve the outlook for patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck cancers. Among these advancements are refinements in altered fractionation, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, neutron-beam radiotherapy, charged-particle radiotherapy, and intraoperative radiotherapy. These recent developments have allowed radiation oncologists to escalate the dose of radiation delivered to tumors while minimizing the dose delivered to surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, more continues to be learned about the optimum delivery of chemotherapy. This article provides an update on the status of these new developments in the treatment of head and neck cancers. [References: 67]	
3890	Biopsy and definitive radiation therapy in Stage I and II adenocarcinoma of the female breast: analysis of cosmesis and the role of electron beam supplementation	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Arm, Axilla, Biopsy, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Electrons, Esthetics, Female, Humans, Lymph Node Excision, Multivariate Analysis, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The cosmetic and functional outcome in 130 patients with Stages I and II carcinoma of the breast treated by biopsy and radiation therapy were evaluated. The cosmetic outcome was excellent in 107 patients (82%), acceptable in 17 patients (13%), and unacceptable in six patients (5%). Complete axillary dissection (CAD) was more morbid than limited axillary dissection (LAD) as a means of preradiotherapy staging of the axilla. The former was more often associated with breast edema, hematoma formation, and subsequent development of arm edema than the latter. A multivariate analysis revealed that the four most dominant variables associated with the attainment of an excellent cosmetic outcome were: 1) the performance of a conservative biopsy procedure; 2) small breast size (cup size A and B); 3) the use of electron energies equal to or less than 12 MeV; and 4) the presence of primary tumors less than or equal to 4 cm in diameter when adjusted for breast size. Postexternal beam supplementation to the area of the primary tumor was accomplished with electrons in 107 patients (82%) and with interstitial implantation in 23 patients (18%). Excellent cosmetic results were achieved in 97 of the 107 patients (91%) treated with electrons. The use of electrons appears to produce local control and cosmesis equal to that of interstitial implantation if specific indications and guidelines are followed, and is superior to implantation in certain clinical settings

Survival curves were generated using V79 cells. The effects on biological parameters (SF2, RBE) of protons were greater than gamma-rays. Furthermore, 3H-thymidine incorporation in KOSC-3 cells, which display the p53 gene mutation, was inhibited by protons much more than by gamma-rays. On the other hand, in bleomycin-sensitive SCCKN cells, 3H-thymidine incorporation decreased more than in bleomycin-resistant SCCTF cells, however, both were inhibited by protons much more than by gamma-rays. In this study, the biological parameters and 3H-thymidine incorporation caused by 65 MeV protons were more severe than those caused by 137Cs gamma-rays

Surgical excision is often attempted after embolization. Interventional neuro-radiology is available in only a few centers. If large AVMs can be safely excised without pre-operative embolizaton, then these lesions can be treated at many neurosurgical centers. METHODS: Between January 1986 and June 1992, a total of 210 patients with cerebral AVMs were diagnosed by angiographic studies. Twenty-seven of them had large AVMs wider than 5 cm in the longest diameter. The case records of these patients were retrieved and studied. RESULTS: Two patients were treated with Bragg peak proton beam therapy. Twelve patients were treated conservatively with no improvement. Thirteen patients underwent surgery and total AVM excision was achieved in 11. None of the patients who underwent surgery had any pre- or intra-operative embolization. All the patients had no neurological deterioration post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS: Large cerebral AVMs can be treated by surgical excision alone with acceptable results	
3928	BEAM: a Monte Carlo code to simulate radiotherapy treatment units	Canada, Electrons, Humans, Jaw, Models,Structural, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Water	This paper describes BEAM, a general purpose Monte Carlo code to simulate the radiation beams from radiotherapy units including high-energy electron and photon beams, 60Co beams and orthovoltage units. The code handles a variety of elementary geometric entities which the user puts together as needed (jaws, applicators, stacked cones, mirrors, etc.), thus allowing simulation of a wide variety of accelerators. The code is not restricted to cylindrical symmetry. It incorporates a variety of powerful variance reduction techniques such as range rejection, bremsstrahlung splitting and forcing photon interactions. The code allows direct calculation of charge in the monitor ion chamber. It has the capability of keeping track of each particle's history and using this information to score separate dose components (e.g., to determine the dose from electrons scattering off the applicator). The paper presents a variety of calculated results to demonstrate the code's capabilities. The calculated dose distributions in a water phantom irradiated by electron beams from the NRC 35 MeV research accelerator, a Varian Clinac 2100C, a Philips SL75-20, an AECL Therac 20 and a Scanditronix MM50 are all shown to be in good agreement with measurements at the 2 to 3% level. Eighteen electron spectra from four different commercial accelerators are presented and various aspects of the electron beams from a Clinac 2100C are discussed. Timing requirements and selection of parameters for the Monte Carlo calculations are discussed

It is of note that they provide no evidence for a dose threshold and are compatible with a linear dose-response relationship, at least for ultraviolet radiation exposed skin. The studies also provide varying amounts of evidence concerning a number of other important issues in assessing skin cancer risk: types of skin cancer induced by ionizing radiation, the appropriateness of relative risk vs absolute risk models, combined effects of ionizing and UV radiations, and variations in sensitivity to skin cancer induction among demographic and genetic subgroups. Little epidemiological information is available on several factors, such as the RBE for high-LET radiation, the effects of dose protraction or fractionation, or variations in risk by age at irradiation. A reasonable estimate of skin cancer lethality was 0.2 per cent when weighted for the relative proportions of squamous cell and basal cell skin cancers. Average risk estimates of radiation-induced skin cancer incidence were: absolute risk (AR) of 8.5 X 10(-4) person-year-Sv and excess relative risk (RR) of 52 per cent/Sv. Lifetime skin cancer risk was calculated by life-table methods for males from exposures spread out over ages 20-60 years. The estimates for excess skin cancer incidence were 2 per cent and 11 per cent per Sv under the AR and RR models, respectively, while the corresponding mortality risks were 4 X 10(-5) and 2 X 10(-4) per Sv.

CPT is different from conventional radiotherapy: the dose is deposited far more selectively in Bragg Peaks by either protons or "heavy" ions, such as carbon. In this way, it is possible to "dose paint" targets, voxel by voxel, with far less dose to surrounding tissues than with X-ray techniques. At present the UK possesses a 62 MeV cyclotron proton facility at Clatterbridge (Wirral), which provides therapy for intraocular cancers such as melanoma; for deeper situated cancers in the pelvis, chest etc., much higher energies, over 200 MeV are required from a synchrotron facility. There is an impressive expansion in particle beam therapy (PBT) centres worldwide, since they offer good prospects of improved quality of life with enhanced cancer cures in situations where conventional therapy is limited due to radioresistance or by the close proximity of critical normal tissues. There is a threat to UK Oncology, since it is anticipated that several thousand British patients may require referral abroad for therapy; this would severely disrupt their multidisciplinary management and require demanding logistical support.

This is particularly so for complex techniques such as mixed photon and electron beam radiotherapy and electron beam modulated therapy. This study demonstrates that it is possible to use the bremsstrahlung photons in an electron beam from a dual scattering foil linear accelerator to obtain portal images of electron beam treatments. The possibility of using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to predict the electron beam treatment portal images was explored. The MC code EGSnrc was used to model a Varian CL21EX linear accelerator (linac) and to characterize the bremsstrahlung photon production in the linac head. It was found that the main sources of photons in the electron beam are the scattering foils, the applicator and the beam-shaping cut-out. Images were acquired using the Varian CL21EX linac and the Varian aS500 electronic portal imager (EPI); four electron energies (6, 9, 12, 16 MeV), and different applicator and cut-out sizes were used. It was possible to acquire images with as little as 10.7 MU per image. The contrast, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the resolution and an estimate of the modulated transfer function (MTF) of the electron beam portal images were computed using a quality assurance (QA) phantom and were found to be comparable to those of a 6 MV photon beam. Images were also acquired using a Rando anthropomorphic phantom. MC simulations were used to model the aS500 EPID and to obtain predicted portal images of the QA and Rando phantom. The contrast in simulated and measured portal images agrees within +/-5% for both the QA and the Rando phantom. The measured and simulated images allow for a verification of the phantom positioning by making sure that the structure edges are well aligned. This study suggests that the Varian aS500 portal imager can be used to obtain patient portal images of electron beams in the scattering foil linacs

Radiosurgery using the gamma knife is a non-invasive stereotactic neurosurgical procedure. Radiosurgery, as microsurgery, must be evaluated not only early, but also the late effect after the treatment some years. Evaluation of the results is therefore an ongoing process and results of the first year with the 5-year follow up are presented. At this time radiosurgery has a zero treatment mortality and the present morbidity with regard to the diagnosis 0-10%

2019	An alpha-particle emitting antibody ([213Bi]J591) for radioimmunotherapy of prostate cancer	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal/im [Immunology], Antibodies,Monoclonal/me [Metabolism], Antibodies,Monoclonal/pd [Pharmacology], Antigen-Antibody Complex/me [Metabolism], Binding Sites, Bismuth, Bismuth/pd [Pharmacology], Cell Death/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Humans, Immunotoxins/im [Immunology], Immunotoxins/me [Metabolism], Immunotoxins/pd [Pharmacology], Kinetics, Male, Mice, Mice,Nude, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/im [Immunology], Prostatic Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/pd [Pharmacology], Research, Spheroids,Cellular/re [Radiation Effects], Substrate Specificity, Survival, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays	A novel alpha-particle emitting monoclonal antibody construct targeting the external domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was prepared and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The chelating agent, N-[2-amino-3-(p-isothiocyanatophen-yl)propyl]-trans-cyclohexane-1, 2-diamine-N,N',N',N'',N''-pentaacetic acid, was appended to J591 monoclonal antibody to stably bind the 213Bi radiometal ion. Bismuth-213 is a short-lived (t 1/2 = 46 min) radionuclide that emits high energy alpha-particles with an effective range of 0.07-0.10 mm that are ideally suited to treating single-celled neoplasms and micrometastatic carcinomas. The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line had an estimated 180,000 molecules of PSMA per cell; J591 bound to PSMA with a 3-nM affinity. After binding, the radiolabeled construct-antigen complex was rapidly internalized into the cell, carrying the radiometal inside. [213Bi]J591 was specifically cytotoxic to LNCaP. The LD50 value of [213Bi]J591 was 220 nCi/ml at a specific activity of 6.4 Ci/g. The potency and specificity of [213Bi]J591 directed against LNCaP spheroids, an in vitro model for micrometastatic cancer, also was investigated. [213Bi]J591 effectively stopped growth of LNCaP spheroids relative to an equivalent dose of the irrelevant control [213Bi]HuM195 or unlabeled J591. Cytotoxicity experiments in vivo were carried out in an athymic nude mouse model with an i.m. xenograft of LNCaP cells. [213Bi]J591 was able to significantly improve (P < 0.0031) median tumor-free survival (54 days) in these experiments relative to treatment with irrelevant control [213Bi]HuM195 (33 days), or no treatment (31 days). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was also specifically reduced in treated animals. At day 51, mean PSA values were 104 ng/ml +/- 54 ng/ml (n = 4, untreated animals), 66 ng/ml +/- 16 ng/ml (n = 6, animals treated with [213Bi]HuM195), and 28 ng/ml +/- 22 ng/ml (n = 6, animals treated with [213Bi]J591). The reduction of PSA levels in mice treated with [213Bi]J591 relative to mice treated with [213Bi]HuM195 and untreated control animals was significant with P < 0.007 and P < 0.0136, respectively. In conclusion, a novel [213Bi]-radiolabeled J591 has been constructed that selectively delivers alpha-particles to prostate cancer cells for potent and specific killing in vitro and in vivo

In the contrast representation 49 out of 66 patients showed a reduced enhancement after radiotherapy, an increase was observed in twelve patients. In 15 out of 22 cases, the irradiation was followed by a decrease of ventricle compression. In case of ventricular dilatation (n = 5), three decreases and two increases were observed. In case of displacement of the mid line (n = 15), eight decreases, five increases, and two identical results were found. Twelve patients presented radiogenic side effects of the central nervous system or the cerebral metastases	
1169	Gliomatosis cerebri: clinical, neurochemical and neuroradiological response to temozolomide administration	Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents,Alkylating/ad [Administration & Dosage], Brain Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain/de [Drug Effects], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/pa [Pathology], Dacarbazine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Dacarbazine/ad [Administration & Dosage], Humans, Italy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Neuroepithelial/dt [Drug Therapy], Neoplasms,Neuroepithelial/pa [Pathology], Prognosis, Radiation, Research, Syndrome, Treatment Outcome	Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare form of diffusely infiltrating glioma that is typically resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy and carries a poor prognosis. Temozolomide has shown antineoplastic activity against malignant gliomas and more recently was beneficial in one patient with gliomatosis cerebri. To make an objective assessment of the effect of long-term temozolomide administration in a patient with gliomatosis cerebri we used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural MRI. A 46-year-old man with gliomatosis cerebri was treated with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 28 days). Twenty cycles of temozolomide resulted in a marked reduction in choline and scyllo-inositol content, as detected using brain proton MR spectroscopy, indicating reduced tumor cellularity and/or growth rate. Neurochemical improvements were associated with normalization of the signal intensity in most of the previously affected cerebral regions and regression of mass effect on MRI. A left pyramidal syndrome, present at the start of the treatment, disappeared. Our observation lends support to larger clinical trials evaluating the use of temozolomide to treat this brain tumor	
73	Calculation of boron neutron capture cell inactivation in vitro based on particle track structure and x-ray sensitivity	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Cell Survival, Elementary Particle Interactions, Germany, Humans, Lithium/ae [Adverse Effects], Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Tolerance/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured, X-Rays/ae [Adverse Effects]	The Monte-Carlo technique was used to perform quantitative microdosimetric model calculations of cell survival after boron neutron capture irradiations in vitro. The high energy 7Li and alpha-particles resulting from the neutron capture reaction 10B (n,alpha)7Li are of short range and are highly damaging to cells. The biophysical model of the Monte-Carlo calculations is based on the track structure of these a-particles and 7Li-ions and the x-ray sensitivity of the irradiated cells. The biological effect of these particles can be determined if the lethal effect of local doses deposited in very small fractional volumes of the cell nucleus is known. This lethal effect can be deduced from experimental data of cell survival after x-ray irradiation assuming a Poisson distribution for lethal events. The input data used in a PC-based computer program are the radial dose distribution inside the track of the released particles, cell survival after x-ray irradiation, geometry of the tumor cells, subcellular 10B concentration, and thermal neutron fluence. The basic concept of this Monte-Carlo computer model is demonstrated. Validations of computer calculations are presented by comparing them with experimental data on cell survival	
277	Carbon ion therapy for ocular melanoma: planning orthogonal two-port treatment	Carbon, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Incidence, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Organ Specificity, Planning Techniques, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Software, Synchrotrons	We recently started orthogonal two-port carbon ion therapy for choroidal melanoma with the intent to reduce the incidence of radiation complications that occur with mono-port therapy. Treatment planning techniques involving therapeutic beam characteristics are described here. The vertical (140 MeV/u) and horizontal (170 MeV/u) carbon ion beams from the synchrotron at the NIRS were shaped, using the passive beam delivery system, to irradiate the target volume. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with a region of uniform HMV-I cell killing. The apertures and range compensators were designed for individual patients. A commercial treatment planning system, which was customized to our general carbon ion therapy, was tested for applicability to this treatment. Dose distributions were calculated with either a broad beam or a pencil beam algorithm using parameters determined by measurements and calculations. We evaluated the accuracy of the system software features, and replaced or added some other features to the software. The system was used for 12 patients during the past year. For nine patients two-port treatment was assessed to be more effective than mono-port therapy and these patients were treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams	
1430	Cognitive function in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: prospective long-term follow-up	Adult, Cognition/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/et [Etiology], Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Time Factors	PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term cognitive function of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data of 95 AVM patients were prospectively assessed up to 3 years after radiosurgery. Of these patients, 39 had a follow-up of at least 2 years. Radiosurgery was performed using a modified linear accelerator (minimal doses to the target volume 15-22 Gy, median dose 20). The neuropsychological evaluation included testing of intelligence, attention, and memory. The effect of a preexisting intracranial hemorrhage, as well as AVM occlusion, on cognitive functions was analyzed after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: No cognitive declines were observed during follow-up. Instead significant improvements occurred in intelligence (1 year, +6.1 IQ points; 2 years, +5.1 IQ points), memory (1 year, +18.3 percentile score; 2 years, +12.2 percentile score), and attention (1 year, +19 percentile score; 2 years, +18 percentile score). Patients without previous intracranial hemorrhage improved more than patients with intracranial hemorrhage, although this difference was not statistically significant. The role of AVM occlusion on cognitive function is not clear at present. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery does not induce measurable deterioration of cognitive function in patients with cerebral AVMs	
2910	Proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas. Results of 5 1/2-year study	Adult, Aged, Computers, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Neoplasm Metastasis, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Proton beam irradiation was used in the treatment of 76 uveal melanomas from July 1975 to December 1980. Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas	
721	Therapy strategies for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas using modern radiation therapy techniques	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Germany, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Orbital Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated whether modern photon techniques, such as stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy (FSRT) or intensity-modulated RT, outweighed the biologic advantages of high-linear-energy transfer RT in the treatment of patients with locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) that infiltrated the skull base or the orbit. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5% and 77.5% for Group A and 72.2% and 24.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5%/53% and 86.6%/75.8% for Group A and 69.2%/23% and 77.9%/77.9% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone	
2787	New radiotherapeutic techniques in nuclear ophthalmology. [Review] [39 refs]	Antibodies,Monoclonal, Boron, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Deoxyuridine/tu [Therapeutic Use], DNA, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Isotopes, Melanins/me [Metabolism], Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Neutron Capture Therapy, Ophthalmology/mt [Methods], Photons, Protons, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Thiouracil/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Various aspects of radiotherapeutic techniques used in treating ocular tumors are discussed. Previous and current "standard" modalities are briefly reviewed, including beta and gamma emitters, 60Co, 125I, and charged particles. In particular, emphasis is placed upon techniques under development that use biomolecules to physiologically target radioactive or stable isotopes to ocular melanoma. These procedures include 35S-thiouracil, 127I-deoxyuridine in conjunction with irradiation with photons from 145Sm, neutron capture therapy, and various combinations of the above. Thiouracil shows particular promise because of its incorporation during malanin synthesis in growing melanoma. Radiosensitization and stimulation of Auger cascades via introduction of iodine in DNA followed by irradiation with activating photons of appropriate energy (from 145Sm) has been shown to be effective in vitro. Various molecules may be used to transport boron to ocular melanoma, including thiouracil, thus allowing selective irradiation of tumor cells via 10B (n, alpha) 7Li reaction. [References: 39]	
3745	A new combined approach in the conservative management of rectal cancer	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/su [Surgery], Adenocarcinoma/th [Therapy], Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy/is [Instrumentation], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, France, Humans, Iridium Radioisotopes, Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Rectal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Rectum, Recurrence	Between 1980 and 1987, 25 patients with rectal cancer were treated with a combination of preoperative external irradiation of 35 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks which was followed, 6 to 8 weeks later, by a tumorectomy and peroperative placement of a plastic tube loop for post-operative interstitial therapy by iridium-192. This boost dose was 20 Gy (Paris System) for submucosal lesions (seven patients) and 25 Gy for intramural (eight patients) and extramural (ten patients) lesions. With a mean follow-up of 40.5 months, there have been five local recurrences, the latest occurring 16 months post-tumorectomy. Two of these five patients are alive and disease-free 1 year post salvage abdominoperineal resection. The 20 patients with local control have preserved a full functional sphincter and 19 of them are disease-free; there were few complications. This sphincter preserving combined approach seems promising for patients with tumors of the middle and lower rectum who cannot undergo major surgery and for selected patients who refuse abdominoperineal resection	
3839	Monte Carlo simulation of the biological effects of boron neutron capture irradiation with d(14)+Be neutrons in vitro	Boron, Boron Compounds, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Computer Simulation, Extracellular Space, Fast Neutrons, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Melanoma, Monte Carlo Method, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Phenylalanine, Physics, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Effects, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities	It was shown that radiation effects in tumor cells treated with fast neutrons may be increased by the neutron capture reaction 10B(n, alpha)7Li. The classic approach for macroscopic dosimetry in fast-neutron therapy cannot be applied to the dose in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The effectiveness of BNCT in killing tumor cells depends on the number of 10B atoms delivered to the tumor, the subcellular distribution of 10B and the thermal neutron fluence at the site of the tumor. Monte Carlo calculations of the energy depositions of short-range particles with high LET coming from 10B disintegrations were performed and compared to the observed biological effects. The simulation allows us to study the influence of the localization of intracellular 10B in the nucleus, cytoplasma, plasma membrane or extracellular space. The biological response function which describes the probability of the lethal effect produced by a single particle track through the cell nucleus was found by comparing the calculated microscopic dose distribution spectra for single events with the survival observed experimentally. Calculations for a human melanoma cell population treated as a monolayer in the presence or absence of boron with d(14)+Be neutrons will be demonstrated. Two different boron compounds enriched in 10B were investigated in this study: boric acid (H3 10BO3) and p-dihydroxyboryl phenylalanine (BPA). The study shows that a high fraction of BPA enters the cytoplasm while boric acid was found only in the extracellular space. The computer simulations indicate that BPA yields a higher potential effectiveness for inactivation of melanoma cells than boric acid	
3671	Vitamins as radioprotectors in vivo. I. Protection by vitamin C against internal radionuclides in mouse testes: implications to the mechanism of damage caused by the Auger effect	Alpha Particles, Animals, Ascorbic Acid/pd [Pharmacology], Electrons, Half-Life, Humans, Idoxuridine, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/me [Metabolism], Iodine Radioisotopes/to [Toxicity], Male, Mice, Polonium, Polonium/to [Toxicity], Radiation, Radiation-Protective Agents, Radiation-Protective Agents/pd [Pharmacology], Radioisotopes, Research, Spermatogonia/de [Drug Effects], Spermatogonia/re [Radiation Effects], Testis/de [Drug Effects], Testis/me [Metabolism], Testis/re [Radiation Effects], Universities	The potential of vitamin C, an antioxidant, to protect the radiosensitive spermatogonial cells in mouse testes against the effects of chronic irradiation by radionuclides incorporated into tissue was investigated. Interestingly, when injected intratesticularly, a small and nontoxic amount of vitamin C (1.5 microgram in 3 microliters saline) protected the spermatogonia against the damage associated with high-LET radiation caused by Auger electrons from similarly administered 5-(125I)-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (125IdU). A dose modification factor (DMF) of 2.3 was obtained. In contrast, no protection was observed when 210Po, an alpha-particle emitter, was administered similarly. These findings suggest that the mechanism of action of the Auger effect is of an indirect nature, which is in contrast to the direct action generally believed to be responsible for biological damage caused by high-LET radiations	
4478	A Monte Carlo investigation of the dosimetric properties of monoenergetic neutron beams for neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Engineering, Humans, Isotopes, Massachusetts, Models,Structural, Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research	A Monte Carlo simulation study has been carried out to investigate the suitability of neutron beams of various energies for therapeutic efficacy in boron neutron capture therapy. The dosimetric properties of unidirectional, monoenergetic neutron beams of varying diameters in two different phantoms (a right-circular cylinder and an ellipsoid) made of brain-equivalent material were examined. The source diameter was varied from 0.0 to 20.0 cm; neutron energies ranged from 0.025 eV up to 800 keV, the maximum neutron energy generated by a tandem cascade accelerator using 2.5-MeV protons in a 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction. Such a device is currently under investigation for use as a neutron source for boron neutron capture therapy. The simulation studies indicate that the maximum effective treatment depth (advantage depth) in the brain is 10.0 cm and is obtainable with a 10-keV neutron beam. A useful range of energies, defined as those neutron energies capable of effectively treating to a depth of 7 cm in brain tissue, is found to be 4.0 eV to 40.0 keV. Beam size is shown not to affect advantage depth as long as the entire phantom volume is used in determining this depth. Dose distribution in directions parallel to and perpendicular to the beam direction are shown to illustrate this phenomenon graphically as well as to illustrate the differences in advantage depth and advantage ratio and the contribution of individual dose components to tumor dose caused by the geometric differences in phantom shape

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma	
1644	Quantifying radiation therapy-induced brain injury with whole-brain proton MR spectroscopy: initial observations	Adult, Aged, Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Brain Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Brain Injuries/et [Etiology], Female, Humans, Hydrogen, Lung, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Mental Status Schedule, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Radiation Oncology, Research, Women	PURPOSE: To quantify the extent of neuronal cell loss imparted to the brain by means of radiation therapy through the decline of the amino acid derivative N-acetylaspartate (NAA) by using proton (hydrogen 1) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter	
711	A cosmetic evaluation of breast cancer treatment: a randomized study of radiotherapy boost technique	Adult, Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast/pa [Pathology], Confidence Intervals, Electrons, Esthetics, Female, Humans, Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Odds Ratio, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To compare cosmetic results of two different radiotherapy (RT) boost techniques used in the treatment of breast cancer after whole breast radiotherapy and to identify factors affecting cosmetic outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 1998, 142 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with breast conservative surgery and adjuvant RT. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a boost dose of 15 Gy delivered to the tumor bed either by iridium 192, or a combination of photons and electrons. Cosmetic evaluations were done on a 6-month basis, with a final evaluation at 36 months after RT. The evaluations were done using a panel of global and specific subjective scores, a digitized scoring system using the breast retraction assessment (BRA) measurement, and a patient's self-assessment evaluation. As cosmetic results were graded according to severity, the comparison of boost techniques was done using the ordinal logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. RESULTS: At 36 months of follow-up, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the global subjective cosmetic outcome (OR = 1.40; 95%CI = 0.69-2.85, p = 0.35). Good to excellent scores were observed in 65% of implant patients and 62% of photon/electron patients. At 24 months and beyond, telangiectasia was more severe in the implant group with an OR of 9.64 (95%CI = 4.05-22.92, p < 0.0001) at 36 months. The only variable associated with a worse global cosmetic outcome was the presence of concomitant chemotherapy (OR = 3.87; 95%CI = 1.74-8.62). The BRA value once adjusted for age, concomitant chemotherapy, and boost volume showed a positive association with the boost technique. The BRA value was significantly greater in the implant group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the patient's final self-assessment score between the two groups. Three variables were statistically associated with an adverse self-evaluation: an inferior quadrant tumor localization, postoperative hematoma, and concomitant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial showed that at 36 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in the overall global cosmetic scores between the implant boost group and the photon/electron boost group, telangiectasia was more severe and the BRA value was greater in the implant group	
4437	Comparison of dose homogeneity effects due to electron equilibrium loss in lung for 6 MV and 18 MV photons	Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Electrons, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: Loss of electronic equilibrium within and adjacent to low density materials can result in a dose reduction along the central axis and near the beam edge for megavoltage photon beams. In this context, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol #91-05 recommends the use of photon beams of energy 12 MV or less for nonsmall cell lung cancer therapy. This work presents data to support the use of higher energy photons for some clinical lung field setups. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Beam profiles were obtained from films inserted into homogeneous (polystyrene) and heterogeneous (polystyrene and lung-equivalent material) phantoms and irradiated in both single-field and parallel-opposed setups with 6 and 18 MV photon beams. Depth-dose curves were obtained with a parallel-plate ion chamber in the heterogeneous phantom to determine the range of field sizes over which the dose reduction at the lung/polystyrene interface becomes clinically significant. RESULTS: Opposed field profiles show less degradation in the penumbra (50-90% width) at the lung/polystyrene interface than single-field profiles. The difference between 6 and 18 MV penumbra widths at the interface also reduced when an opposed field is added. The central axis dose reduction at the interface was negligible for single fields of a width of 8 cm or more. CONCLUSION: Our results show that for opposed fields, the difference in penumbra degradation of the 6 and 18 MV photon beams is clinically insignificant compared to daily setup errors and patient motion. The central axis dose reduction is also shown to be small. Our data support the use of higher energy beams to obtain lower peripheral dose maxima in small clinical geometries	
3231	In vitro radiation studies on Ewing's sarcoma cell lines and human bone marrow: application to the clinical use of total body irradiation (TBI)	Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], DNA Repair, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Extremities, Hematopoietic Stem Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radiation, Risk, Sarcoma, Sarcoma,Ewing's/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Whole-Body Irradiation	Patients with Ewing's sarcoma who present with a central axis or proximal extremity primary and/or with metastatic disease have a poor prognosis despite aggressive combination chemotherapy and local irradiation. In this high risk group of patients, total body irradiation (TBI) has been proposed as a systemic adjuvant. To aid in the design of a clinical TBI protocol, we have studied the in vitro radiation response of two established cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma and human bone marrow CFUc. The Ewing's lines showed a larger Do (1.26 Gy, 2.04 Gy) and n (6.0, 3.2) compared to the bone marrow CFUc (Do = 0.86 Gy, n = 1.2). No repair of potentially lethal radiation damage (PLDR) was found after 4.5 Gy in plateau phase Ewing's sarcoma cells. A theoretical split dose survival curve for both the Ewing's sarcoma lines and human bone marrow CFUc using this TBI schedule shows a significantly lower surviving fraction (10(-4)-10(-5] for the bone marrow CFUc. Based on these in vitro results, two 4.0 Gy fractions separated by 24 hours is proposed as the TBI regimen. Because of the potentially irreversible damage to bone marrow, autologous bone marrow transplantation following the TBI is felt to be necessary. The details of this clinical protocol in high risk Ewing's sarcoma patients are outlined	
1959	Complex hprt deletion events are recovered after exposure of human lymphoblastoid cells to high-LET carbon and neon ion beams	Carbon, Carbon/to [Toxicity], Cyclotrons, DNA Primers, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Heavy Ions/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/ge [Genetics], Ions, Japan, Leukemia/me [Metabolism], Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Genetic, Mutagenesis, Mutation, Neon, Neon/to [Toxicity], Point Mutation, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Research, Sequence Analysis,DNA, Tumor Cells,Cultured	Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (hprt) mutations were induced in human TK-6 lymphoblastoid cells by irradiation at a linear energy transfer (LET) of 250 or 310 keV/micron for carbon and neon ions, respectively. At such a high level of LET, ions will lose most of their total energy and stop shortly after passing through the cell. The hprt mutations were analyzed by multiplex PCR, long-PCR and DNA sequencing of both genomic and cDNA. Over half of the C ion-induced hprt mutations (10 of 19) were point mutations, in contrast to 15% of the mutations induced by Ne ions (three of 20). The remaining 47 and 85% of the C and Ne ion-induced mutants, respectively, are deletion events. The latter events include three complex losses of multiple non-contiguous exon regions in both ion irradiation collections. We note that mutations involving the exon 6 region are frequent in the Ne ion collection: all three of the complex events retained the exon 6 region with flanking deletion of sequence and three other mutants involved deletion of this region. It may be concluded that these high-LET C and Ne ion irradiations produce different mutational spectra

Although analytical calculations in homogeneous media are relatively straightforward, the modelling of the propagation of the beam through density heterogeneities can be more problematical. At the Paul Scherrer Institute, an in-house dedicated Monte Carlo (MC) code has been used for over a decade to assess the possible deficiencies of the analytical calculations in patient geometries. The MC code has been optimized for speed, and as such traces primary protons only through the treatment nozzle and patient's CT. Contributions from nuclear interactions are modelled analytically with no tracing of secondary particles. The MC code has been verified against measured data in water and experimental proton radiographs through a heterogeneous anthropomorphic phantom. In comparison to the analytical calculation, the MC code has been applied to both spot scanned and intensity modulated proton therapy plans, and to a number of cases containing titanium metal implants. In summary, MC-based dose calculations could provide an invaluable tool for independently verifying the calculated dose distribution within a patient geometry as part of a comprehensive quality assurance protocol for proton treatment plans

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality

Accepted uncertainties in current w values for protons leads to a dosimetric uncertainty of 4 per cent when ionization chambers are employed to measure absorbed dose. For this reason, proton dosimetry protocols recommend the use of calorimetry as the absorbed dose standard. We used calorimetry in conjunction with an ionization chamber with 60Co reference calibrations to deduce the proton w value in the entrance region of a 250 MeV proton beam: 34.2 +/- 0.5 eV. Application of this w value, with its 1.5 per cent uncertainty, allows determination of dose in therapeutic proton beams, with uncertainties comparable to photon and electron values

Despite a 3D conformal RT technique and the omission of elective mediastinal fields, three (of ten) patients with inoperable stage 3 NSCLC who were treated with induction chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) followed by RT to 70 Gy, developed symptomatic radiation pneumonitis. In this planning study, the actual treatment plans of all ten patients were compared to plans derived using two beam intensity-modulated (BIM) techniques, for which similar geometrical beam setup parameters were used. In the first technique (BF-BIM), cranial and caudal boost fields were applied in order to allow field length reduction. The second technique (C-BIM) utilised 3-D missing-tissue compensators for all radiation beams. Both BIM techniques resulted in a significant sparing of critical normal tissues and the C-BIM technique was superior in all cases. When compared to the actual RT technique used for treatment, a reduction of 8.1+/-4.7% (1 S.D.) was observed in the mean lung dose for the BF-BIM plan, vs. 20.3+/-5.8% (1 S.D.) for the C-BIM plan. Similar reductions were observed in the percentage of the total lung volume exceeding 20 Gy (V(20)) for these techniques. BIM techniques appear to be a promising tool for enabling radiation dose-escalation and/or intensive concurrent chemo-RT in inoperable lung cancer

[Russian]	Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Male, Methods, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	The paper is devoted to the description of methods of topometric preparation of 73 prostatic cancer patients for gamma-and proton-beam irradiation using an x-ray simulator and a CT tomograph. Basing on the measurement of the prostate in 3 directions in patients with different stages of disease (T1-2-24, T3-29 and T4-20), a conclusion was made that a prostate size was not enough to determine a stage of disease though a tendency to an increase in prostate size corresponded to the growing T index. However, stages T1-2 and T4 could be determined for sure within a certain range of prostate size values

The algorithm uses the standard pencil beam technique of laterally distributing the central axis broad beam doses according to the Moliere scattering theory extended to slablike varying density media. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of our computational tool by comparing it with experimental and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data as benchmarks. In the tests, parallel wide beams of protons were scattered in water phantoms containing embedded air and bone materials with simple geometrical forms and spatial dimensions of a few centimeters. For homogeneous water and bone phantoms, the proton doses we calculated with the ASPB algorithm were found very comparable to experimental and MC data. For layered bone slab inhomogeneity in water, the comparison between our analytical calculation and the MC simulation showed reasonable agreement, even when the inhomogeneity was placed at the Bragg peak depth. There also was reasonable agreement for the parallelepiped bone block inhomogeneity placed at various depths, except for cases in which the bone was located in the region of the Bragg peak, when discrepancies were as large as more than 10%. When the inhomogeneity was in the form of abutting air-bone slabs, discrepancies of as much as 8% occurred in the lateral dose profiles on the air cavity side of the phantom. Additionally, the analytical depth-dose calculations disagreed with the MC calculations within 3% of the Bragg peak dose, at the entry and midway depths in the phantom. The distal depth-dose 20%-80% fall-off widths and ranges calculated with our algorithm and the MC simulation were generally within 0.1 cm of agreement. The analytical lateral-dose profile calculations showed smaller (by less than 0.1 cm) 20%-80% penumbra widths and shorter fall-off tails than did those calculated by the MC simulations. Overall, this work validates the usefulness of our ASPB algorithm as a reasonably fast and accurate tool for quality assurance in planning wide beam proton therapy treatment of clinical sites either composed of homogeneous materials or containing laterally extended inhomogeneities that are comparable in density and located away from the Bragg peak depths

The external therapy with telecobalt or by an 18 MeV betatron was dosed from 3000 to 4000 rads. Most of the patients received an additional single intraperitoneal application of 150 mCi gold-198. The five-year survival rate of all patients was 45%, whereas it was 71% for stage I, 47% for stage II, 21% for stage III, and 4% for stage IV. In 3% out of all cases, surgical procedure was necessary because of complications. Today, an indication for intraperitoneal therapy by radioactive isotopes is only adopted in case of a ruptured malignant ovarian tumor

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unirradiated recipient HSG cells were co-cultivated with HSG donor cells irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams having different LET values. Cell proliferation and micronucleus (MN) induction in recipient cells with and without treatment of a NO scavenger (PTIO) were measured and the concentration of nitrite in the co-culture medium was detected. As a direct control, the effects of a nitric oxide (NO) generator (sper/NO) on cell proliferation and MN induction were also examined. RESULTS: Increases in cell proliferation and MN induction were found in the recipient HSG cells as a result of co-culturing and cell proliferation was obviously enhanced during a further subculture. In comparison with 13keV/microm, 100keV/microm carbon-ion irradiation was found to be a more efficient inducer of the medium-mediated bystander effect. The treatment of cells by PTIO resulted in elimination of such effects, which supports a role for NO in the medium-mediated bystander effect. As an oxidization product of NO, nitrite was detected in the co-culture medium, and the dose-response for its concentration was similar to that of cell proliferation and MN induction in the recipient cells. When the HSG cells were treated by sper/NO with a concentration of less than 20 microM cell proliferation was enhanced, whereas MN increased along with sper/NO concentration. CONCLUSION: NO participated in the medium-mediated bystander effects on cell proliferation and MN induction, depending on the LET of irradiation	
519	Sequential evaluation of hepatic functional reserve by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin scintigraphy after proton beam therapy: a report of three cases and a review of the literatures.

In this report, we present three patients with malignant liver tumors treated by proton beam therapy in whom pre- and post-therapeutic hepatic functional reserves were evaluated sequentially for more than a year by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. All three patients exhibited the distinctive time course of 99mTc-GSA uptake efficiency, which suggested a transient decline in the ratio of liver activity to heart and liver activity at 15 minutes (LHL15) 3-6 months after proton beam therapy. This change was not in parallel with that expected from a functioning normal liver tissue volume. In a year after proton beam therapy, LHL15 recovered nearly to the pre-treatment level in all three patients. Our observations may be related to the up-regulation of receptor-mediated 99mTc-GSA uptake during hepatic regeneration after proton beam therapy. [References: 27]	
2434	An electron beam pseudoarc technique for irradiation of large areas of chest wall and other curved surfaces	Electrons, Humans, Jaw, Lead, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Skin, Thorax	An electron beam technique has been developed for the treatment of large areas of the chest wall and other curved surfaces employing the stationary field electron beam mode ordinarily available on a linear accelerator. The technique simulates an arc through the use of multiple fixed fields. The electron collimator is not used. Field shaping is achieved through the combined effects produced by the photon jaw settings, the arc limits, and secondary lead shielding on the patient's skin. Thus, there is no limitation on the circumferential extent of the field size that can be used. Electron beam energies of 6 MeV, 9 MeV, 12 MeV, 15 MeV and 18 MeV have been studied. Our findings indicate that, for these energies, this technique produces isodose curves parallel to the cylindrical surface at all depths beyond maximum build-up. This paper discusses the physical characteristics of the single beams, the degree of dose homogeneity achieved with the multiple fields, and the dosimetry technique developed to implement the therapy

At present there are approximately 20 active protocols, some specifying radio-oncological study questions, in which about 500 to 600 children annually are given radiotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Pediatric Radiation Oncology Working Group (APRO) of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) represents the organizational link between GPOH and DEGRO. Their activities range from phrasing guidelines of radio-oncological therapy, through writing a protocol for a prospective study on radiation-induced late effects (RISK--in co-operation with GPOH, 695 patients registered so far) and organizing meetings for information transfer, to implementing radio-oncology within the prospective studies of the GPOH by establishing study chairs for radio-oncology when radio-oncological questions are a primary focus and/or to function as a reference institution for quality assurance. These activities also include individual case consultations outside the study proper. Twice annually the members of the APRO meet for an update on current knowledge and future directions where a representative of the GPOH is invited to contribute special aspects of pediatric oncology. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, modern technology (intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, inclusion of imaging in treatment planning) will be part of disease management in pediatric oncology. A working group for modern radiotherapy technology was established to enhance this development. Prospective studies of the GPOH with primary or secondary radio-oncological questions require the implementation of corresponding tasks (documentation, monitoring, etc.) in order to meet future demands on clinical trials and to achieve the aims of the protocol. Consequently adequate financial support is indispensable

Although histologically benign, their invasive nature makes true "oncological" resection virtually impossible to achieve in most cases, despite modern skull base surgical techniques. Moreover, because of the tumor's location and proximity to critical neural and vascular structures, surgery-related morbidity can be significant when an aggressive resection is undertaken. Cytoreductive surgery assumes a critical role in the management of these lesions. The choice of surgical approach and the extent of resection are dependent on several factors: location and extension of the tumor, the surgeon's philosophy and familiarity with a specific approach, and the patient's preexisting clinical status. Proton-beam radiotherapy seems to be effective as an adjunct to surgery in achieving local tumor control. The timing of radiation therapy, however, remains controversial. Gamma knife surgery has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy, but the limited experience and short follow-up periods do not permit formulation of meaningful conclusions at this time. Recurrences are common, although in a subset of patients prolonged disease-free survival is demonstrated. [References: 108]

For Boron Neutron Capture therapy (BNCT) at the High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten/NL such a programme has been developed on the basis of IEC publications for medical electron accelerators. RESULTS: The fundamental differences of clinical dosimetry for medical electron accelerators and BNCT are presented and the order of magnitude of dose components and their stability and that of the main other influencing parameter 10B concentration for BNCT patient treatments. A comparison is given for requirements for accelerators and BNCT units indicating items which are not transferable, equal or additional. Preliminary results of in vivo measurements done with a set of 55Mn, 63Cu and 197Au activation foils for all single fields for the four fractions at all 15 treated patients show with < +/- 4% up to now a worse reproducibility than the used dose monitoring systems (+/- 1.5%) caused by influence of hair position on the foil-skull distance. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the more complex clinical dosimetry (because of four relevant dose components, partly of different linear energy transfer (LET)) BNCT can be regulated following the principles of quality assurance procedures for therapy with medical electron accelerators. The reproducibility of applied neutron fluence (proportional to absorbed doses) and the main safety aspects are equal for all teletherapy methods including BNCT. [References: 27]

Six patients had positron emission tomography 15 to 25 minutes after radiation therapy with a 42 MeV accelerator. Five patients had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and one required therapy for a carcinoma of the common bile duct. We sought to determine whether state-of-the-art PET technology could be used to monitor the three-dimensional activity distribution of radiation-induced radioactivity. At the time of the examination all six patients had sufficient concentrations of C-11 and N-13 activity in the irradiated volume to permit the evaluation of the activity distribution. We found significant activity at the body surface, which permitted field delineation. We conclude that the in vivo generated radioactivity can be monitored with PET

Additional steel and granular fill was added to the modular sections on-site during construction. The building will be disassembled and removed when no longer needed. This paper describes the radiation shielding specifications and survey of the facility, as well as the ramifications for acceptance testing occasioned by the novel installation procedure. The LINAC is a Varian 21EX operating at 6 MV and 18 MV. The radiation levels outside the vault satisfied the design criteria, and no anomalous leakage was detected along the joints of the modular structure. At 18 MV and 600 monitor units (MU) per minute, the radiation level outside the primary barrier walls was 8.5 micro Sv/h of photons; there were no detectable neutrons. Outside the direct-shielded door, the levels were 0.4 micro Sv/h of photons and 3.0 micro Sv/h of neutrons. The isocentricity of the accelerator met the acceptance criteria and was not affected by its preinstallation into an integrated baseframe and subsequent transport to the building site	
3620	[Proton irradiation of bone metastases]. [Russian]	Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Bone Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Breast, Breast Neoplasms, Female, Humans, Jaw, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skull	A proton beam with the energy of 100-130 Mev, the range up to 40-100 mm and diameter up to 6 cm was used for radiation therapy of breast cancer metastases to the bones adjoining the vital organs or normal tissues with low tolerance (the skull, sternum, ribs, jaw, etc.). Medium fractionation regimens were used for the single doses of 4-10 Gy. The number of fractions was from 1 to 7, the summary dose 17-28 Gy that corresponded to 35-46 Gy of classic fractionation designed by the TDF factor. The first experience of the irradiation of bone metastases has shown that general and local reactions to proton irradiation correspond to a dose delivered and irradiation regimen and do not differ from those in conventional radiation. A marked therapeutic effect was obtained in all the patients. The formation of bigger diameter proton beams and of a deeper range is required for the irradiation of large zones of bone metastases

As a means of investigating the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying these disorders we have developed a procedure for selecting mammalian cell lines with features resembling the human pathological phenotypes. The principle of the selection is the use of a fluorescent amphiphilic dye, 2,4-(dimethylamino)-1-styrylmethylpyridiniumiodine, a cation showing two main features. Firstly, it is accumulated by mitochondria to an extent correlated with the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Secondly, upon irradiation with UV light, it gives rise to formation of free radicals, which inflict damage to the cell. Mutant cells with an impairment in oxidative phosphorylation will have more chance to survive than wild type cells. The selection procedure was applied to a stock of mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary cells. After subcloning of the cells which survived the selection procedure, twenty-six independent clones were isolated. Eighteen of the clones had a partial deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase ranging from 30 to 60% of the activity in control cells. The properties of two of the clones are described. One clone has been cultured under non-selective conditions for at least 12 months with retention of the partial deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase	
2353	Stereotactic convergent beam radiosurgery versus stereotactic conformation beam radiotherapy	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Equipment Design, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Hearing, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Complications/et [Etiology], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities	By means of preliminary results in the treatment of patients with acoustic neurinoma the achievable accuracies, dose distributions and time consumption of stereotactic LINAC-based convergent beam radiosurgery are compared to those achieved with fractionated stereotactic conformation beam radiotherapy. Characteristics of both techniques are described. With the Tubingen radiosurgery system a good adaptation of the dose distribution to spherical or oval target volumes with a steep dose gradient was achieved, whereas homogeneity and adaptation of the dose distribution to irregularly shaped targets were better with the Heidelberg conformation technique. The mechanical accuracy of the Tubingen floorstand system was 0.3 mm +/- 0.2 mm, and that of the Heidelberg mask fixation system < 1 mm. Both methods require similar total treatment times. Nine patients were treated by the Tubingen radiosurgery system. The results are compared with 12 patients treated by conformation radiotherapy in Heidelberg. In both patient groups no further tumour growth occurred. Four of 9 single dose treated patients developed side-effects, such as temporary trigeminal and facial paraesthesia hearing deterioration and oedema. In contrast, patients treated by fractionated radiotherapy showed no side-effects. Relating to the short follow-up the results indicate that single dose application has certain drawbacks for special indications. Further studies have to work out which method gives the best treatment results

The major site of deposition is the reticuloendothelial system where it is retained for a long time. CASE REPORTS: Complications occurring late after exposure to thorotrast are described in two patients. RESULTS: One patient had angiosarcoma of liver metastatic to bone and bone marrow failure after a 43 year latency period. The other patient had a thorotrast granuloma and angiosarcoma of the liver after 22 year and 28 year latency periods respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Complications due to thorotrast appear to represent consequences of chronic alpha irradiation	
388	Design study of a raster scanning system for moving target irradiation in heavy-ion radiotherapy	Equipment Design, Heavy Ions, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Software, Synchrotrons, Time Factors	A project to construct a new treatment facility as an extension of the existing heavy-ion medical accelerator in chiba (HIMAC) facility has been initiated for further development of carbon-ion therapy. The greatest challenge of this project is to realize treatment of a moving target by scanning irradiation. For this purpose, we decided to combine the rescanning technique and the gated irradiation method. To determine how to avoid hot and/or cold spots by the relatively large number of rescannings within an acceptable irradiation time, we have studied the scanning strategy, scanning magnets and their control, and beam intensity dynamic control. We have designed a raster scanning system and carried out a simulation of irradiating moving targets. The result shows the possibility of practical realization of moving target irradiation with pencil beam scanning. We describe the present status of our design study of the raster scanning system for the HIMAC new treatment facility

By relating MU to dose measured under reference calibration conditions (central axis, depth of dose maximum in water, 10 cm x 10 cm field defined at 100 cm source-to-surface distance) our formalism determines the MU required for a treatment plan based on the prescription dose and Monte Carlo calculated dose distribution. Detailed descriptions and formulae are given for various clinical situations including conventional treatments and advanced techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT). Analysis is made of the effects of source modelling, beam modifier simulation and patient dose calculation accuracy, all of which are important factors for absolute dose calculations using Monte Carlo simulations. We have tested the formalism through phantom measurements and the predicted MU values were consistent with measured values to within 2%. The formalism has been used for MU calculation and plan comparison for advanced treatment techniques such as MERT, extracranial stereotactic IMRT, MRI-based treatment planning and intensity-modulated laser-proton therapy studies. It is also used for absolute dose calculations using Monte Carlo simulations for treatment verification, which has become part of our comprehensive IMRT quality assurance programme

2672	New treatment modalities for uveal melanoma. [Review] [33 refs]	Brachytherapy, Ciliary Body, Combined Modality Therapy/mt [Methods], Eye, Humans, Laser Therapy, Melanoma, Melanoma/di [Diagnosis], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Necrosis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Research, Survival, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision	The management of uveal melanoma has evolved tremendously for the past century, and more recently there is a trend toward more focal conservative treatment. Enucleation is still performed for large uveal melanoma when there is no hope for useful vision with conservative treatment. Plaque radiotherapy is particularly recommended for medium- or small-sized uveal melanoma. Special custom-designed plaque radiotherapy can be used for iris, ciliary body, or juxtapapillary choroidal melanoma. Charged-particle irradiation constitutes an alternative treatment modality for posterior uveal melanoma. However, charged-particle therapy is limited by the availability of appropriate therapeutic facilities. Local tumor resection using lamellar sclerouvectomy is mainly suitable for selected iris, ciliary body, or anterior choroidal tumors with smaller basal dimension and greater thickness. Ablative laser photocoagulation is indicated for very selected cases of small posterior choroidal uveal melanoma. Combined plaque radiotherapy with indirect ophthalmoscope laser therapy appears to be a more effective local tumor treatment plan than plaque radiotherapy alone. Transpupillary thermotherapy is the newest modality used as primary treatment or as complementary method to brachytherapy for treatment of selected choroidal melanomas. Hyperthermia with infrared irradiation below photocoagulation level produces tumor necrosis with few ocular complications. Based on the published ophthalmic literature, it seems that enucleation carries the same survival prognosis as each of the conservative treatment modalities. [References: 33]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four A-T (ARO, BMA, CSA and RJO) and two control (JAC and KKB3) LCL were exposed to doses of up to 4Gy of accelerated nitrogen ions (32-45 MeV/u, 8-12Gy/min). For comparative purposes X-ray irradiation (1.36 Gy/min) was also performed. The induction of apoptosis was studied 0-48 h after irradiation with the use of two methods: (1) monitoring of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA fragments by field inversion pulse gel electrophoresis (FIGE); and (2) morphological characterization ofapoptotic cells after fluorescent staining. In parallel, cell-cycle distribution, monitored by DNA flow cytometry, as well as measurements of p53/p21(WAF1) protein levels by Western blots, were investigated in these cells. RESULTS: High-LET radiation-induced apoptosis and G2/M-arrest in both A-T and control LCL. No significant increase in the amount of p53/p21(WAF1) proteins preceded apoptosis in control or in A-T LCL after high-LET irradiation. However, low-LET radiation did induce significant enhanced levels of p53 proteins in control but not in A-T LCL. CONCLUSIONS: LCL from both A-T homozygous and unaffected healthy individuals undergo apoptosis without accumulation of p53/p21(WAF1) proteins after exposure to high-LET radiation. In contrast, low-LET radiation induces apoptosis and significantly increases levels of p53 protein in control but not in A-T LCL

D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. These modalities were also compared with traditional 125I plaque brachytherapy. Using a standardised eye model with a representative ocular melanoma tumour, the relative dose distributions within the tumour and surrounding tissue were calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX. Published absorbed dose distributions benchmarked the Monte Carlo models. Results indicate that the proton beam provided superior dose uniformity within the tumour volume, whereas the dose distribution from 106Ru/106Rh was more heterogeneous. Relative to 125I COMS plaque, both 106Ru/106Rh and protons have shown more confined dose distributions to the tumour volume in this situation, thus sparing other critical ocular structures. For protons, it has been shown that only doses lower than the maximum dose are delivered outside the tumour volume. Depending on the clinical situation, this may aid in the sparing of critical structures located in the sclera and optic disc boundary. The Monte Carlo model's statistical uncertainties of the mean dose estimates for the 106Ru/106Rh plaque and proton beam were 3 and 2.5%, respectively

The requirement for defining the relation of the optic nerves and chiasm to the intrasellar contents or suprasellar mass before proton beam irradiation or certain surgical approaches was satisfied. Pneumoencephalography as a supplemental procedure to CT and CT cisternography was replaced. The concomitant elimination of conventional sellar polytomography and pneumoencephalography results in decreased total radiation exposure and a more comfortable, expeditious workup	
1106	Ewing sarcoma: radiation dose and target volume. [Review] [15 refs]	Adolescent, California, Child, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Quality Control, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Sarcoma,Ewing's/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND: The outcome of children and adolescents with Ewing sarcoma is impacted by many prognostic factors and often measured by estimates of: event-free, relapse-free, disease-free, or overall survival. However, the preferred assessment following radiation therapy is local control. PROCEDURE: A review of large group experiences over the past several decades was undertaken to assess the optimal radiation dose and volume for patients with localized, osseous Ewing sarcoma. New approaches and techniques to improve local control were also investigated. RESULTS: With multidisciplinary therapy, 5-year overall local control rates range from 58 to 93%. Following definitive irradiation, they are 53-86%. Recommended radiation therapy doses are 55.8-60.0 Gy. In the postoperative setting, gross disease requires 55.8 Gy; microscopic disease requires 45 Gy. Altered fractionation schemes have not improved local control. The appropriate irradiated volume is an involved field to the pretreatment tumor volume plus 2.0-2.5 cm margin, followed by a boost to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume with margin. Good radiation quality control with central review improves local control. Use of an involved radiation field requires accuracy in defining tumor volume. Techniques to improve local control include risk-adapted multidisciplinary therapy, intraoperative boost radiation, and high radiation doses as delivered by 3-dimensional conformal radiation. Intensity modulated and proton beam radiotherapy may offer an advantage at special sites. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative uses of radiation in the multidisciplinary setting will continue to provide excellent local control, improved function, and quality of life for young patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone.

4233	Accelerated fractionation vs hyperfractionation: rationales for several treatments per day	Clone Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Hand, Humans, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oxygen, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Regeneration, Research, Time	Treatment with several doses per day offers the prospect of a significant therapeutic gain using readily available low LET beams. These regimens can be classified as either accelerated fractionation or hyperfractionation according to their rationales. With accelerated fractionation a conventional number of dose fractions is delivered in a significantly shortened overall treatment time in order to reduce the opportunity for tumor cell regeneration during treatment. With hyperfractionation, on the other hand, a large number of significantly reduced dose fractions is used to give a greater total dose in a conventional overall treatment time. The rationale for this strategy is threefold: 1) increased opportunity for tumor cell redistribution and reoxygenation between dose fractions: 2) a possibly lower oxygen enhancement ratio with small incremental doses; and 3) different sparing of late reacting normal tissues with small dose fractions. A review of the published clinical experience with multiple fractions per day treatment reveals few studies of either pure accelerated fractionation or hyperfractionation since both are limited by acute normal tissue reactions. This has led to a variety of hybrid regimens, some of which have no clear rationale. The choice between accelerated fractionation and hyperfractionation is determined by the regenerative capability of tumor clonogens during treatment. A method of selection based on potential doubling times is presented	
3193	Influence of cone design on the electron beam characteristics on clinical accelerators	Biophysics, Electrons, Housing, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Pennsylvania, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Scattering,Radiation, Skin, Universities	Electron beam characteristics were investigated for different applicator cone designs. Low-energy scattered electrons from the cone housing can contribute to the skin dose. The depth dose was measured as a function of electron energies and field size for different cones. The measurements were compared with calculated 3-D dose distributions obtained from Monte-Carlo-derived energy deposition kernels [Phys. Med. Biol. 37, 391 (1992)]. This comparison shows that beam-defining cones can be fabricated to eliminate low-energy scattered electrons from the cone housing. Eliminating low-energy electrons from the cones provides depth dose (DD) characteristics for clinical electron beams that are comparable to those (1) from nearly monoenergetic electrons (as determined from the practical range of the electrons), and (2) for which the DD is nearly independent of source-to-skin distance. Measurements of DD for small circular fields were also performed. For very small field sizes, corresponding to the width of the lateral spread of a pencil beam, the theoretical and measured DD were found to depend on field size. Three-dimensional dose calculations of small and irregularly shaped electron fields are necessary to appreciate these effects	
2075	Commissioning an image-guided localization system for radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Calibration, Equipment Design, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Lasers, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Rotation, Software, Time, Universities, Washington	PURPOSE: To describe the design and commissioning of a system for the treatment of classes of tumors that require highly accurate target localization during a course of fractionated external-beam therapy. This system uses image-guided localization techniques in the linac vault to position patients being treated for cranial tumors using stereotactic radiotherapy, conformal radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy techniques. Design constraints included flexibility in the use of treatment-planning software, accuracy and precision of repeat localization, limits on the time and human resources needed to use the system, and ease of use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A commercially marketed, stereotactic radiotherapy system, based on a system designed at the University of Florida, Gainesville, was adapted for use at the University of Washington Medical Center. A stereo pair of cameras in the linac vault were used to detect the position and orientation of an array of fiducial markers that are attached to a patient's biteblock. The system was modified to allow the use of either a treatment-planning system designed for stereotactic treatments, or a general, three-dimensional radiation therapy planning program. Measurements of the precision and accuracy of the target localization, dose delivery, and patient positioning were made using a number of different jigs and devices. Procedures were developed for the safe and accurate clinical use of the system. RESULTS: The accuracy of the target localization is comparable to that of other treatment-planning systems. Gantry sag, which cannot be improved, was measured to be 1.7 mm, which had the effect of broadening the dose distribution, as confirmed by a comparison of measurement and calculation. The accuracy of positioning a target point in the radiation field was 1.0 +/- 0.2 mm. The calibration procedure using the room-based lasers had an accuracy of 0.76 mm, and using a floor-based radiosurgery system it was 0.73 mm. Target localization error in a phantom was 0.64 +/- 0.77 mm. Errors in positioning due to couch rotation error were reduced using the system. CONCLUSION: The system described has proven to have acceptable accuracy and precision for the clinical goals for which it was designed. It is robust in detecting errors, and it requires only a nominal increase in setup time and effort. Future work will focus on evaluating its suitability for use in the treatment of head-and-neck cancers not contained within the cranial vault	
1672	Theoretical estimation of absorbed dose to organs in radioimmunotherapy using radionuclides with multiple unstable daughters	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Biological Transport,Active, Biophysics, Half-Life, Humans, Liver, Models,Biological, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/mt [Methods], Radioimmunotherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/bl [Blood], Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Time, Tissue Distribution	The toxicity and clinical utility of long-lived alpha emitters such as Ac-225 and Ra-223 will depend upon the fate of alpha-particle emitting unstable intermediates generated after decay of the conjugated parent. For example, decay of Ac-225 to a stable element yields four alpha particles and seven radionuclides. Each of these progeny has its own free-state biodistribution and characteristic half-life. Therefore, their inclusion for a more accurate prediction of absorbed dose and potential toxicity requires a formalism that takes these factors into consideration as well. To facilitate the incorporation of such intermediates into the dose calculation, a previously developed methodology (model 1) has been extended. Two new models (models 2 and 3) for allocation of daughter products are introduced and are compared with the previously developed model. Model 1 restricts the transport to a function that yields either the place of origin or the place(s) of biodistribution depending on the half-life of the parent radionuclide. Model 2 includes the transient time within the bloodstream and model 3 incorporates additional binding at or within the tumor. This means that model 2 also allows for radionuclide decay and further daughter production while moving from one location to the next and that model 3 relaxes the constraint that the residence time within the tumor is solely based on the half-life of the parent. The models are used to estimate normal organ absorbed doses for the following parent radionuclides: Ac-225, Pb-212, At-211, Ra-223, and Bi-213. Model simulations are for a 0.1 g rapidly accessible tumor and a 10 g solid tumor. Additionally, the effects of varying radiolabled carrier molecule purity and amount of carrier molecules, as well as tumor cell antigen saturation are examined. The results indicate that there is a distinct advantage in using parent radionuclides such as Ac-225 or Ra-223, each having a half-life of more than 10 days and yielding four alpha particles per parent decay, in that lower doses to normal organs result for a given tumor dose in comparison to those radionuclides yielding fewer alpha particles. In model 2, which accounts for transit time through the blood, a dose of 20 Gy to a rapidly accessible 0.1 g tumor will result in a liver and kidney dose of 1.7 and 0.9 Gy, respectively from Ac-225. An equivalent dose to tumor from Ra-223 would yield a maximum normal organ dose of 0.4 and 0.3 Gy to bone and small intestines, respectively; the corresponding absorbed dose to small intestines from Pb-212 and Bi-213 is 2.2 and 3.0 Gy, respectively	
4514	Microdosimetric single event spectra of Ytterbium-169 compared with commonly used brachytherapy sources and teletherapy beams	Air, Brachytherapy, Cell Survival, Cesium Radioisotopes, Cesium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Isotopes, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Ytterbium/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Ytterbium-169 has been developed as a possible replacement for Iridium-192 and Iodine-125. The Theory of Dual Radiation Action predicts that the initial slope of the cell survival curve and therefore the relative biological effect at low dose rate is proportional to dose average lineal energy, yd, which is the microscopic analog of the dose average linear energy transferred. The quality factor used in radiation protection has been shown to be a function of the frequency average lineal energy, yf. Single event microdosimetric spectra for 60Co, 137Cs, 192Ir, 125I and 169Yb were measured in air and at several depths in phantom with a Rossi proportional counter. These spectra show marked differences between sources. The microscopic analogs of the track average and dose average LET, (yd and yf, respectively) differ between isotopes by factors of two or even higher in comparison to megavoltage electron beams. These yd's and yf's for 169Yb are consistently higher when compared to 60Co or 137Cs but are approximately equal to those for 125I. Values of yf and yd for 192Ir are intermediate between 60Co and 169Yb. The Theory of Dual Radiation Action predicts a low dose rate RBE (assuming a 1 micron effective site diameter) compared to 60Co (in air) of: 1.00 for 137Cs, 1.29 for 192Ir, 1.60 for 169Yb and 1.77 for 125I	
1013	A phenomenological model for the relative biological effectiveness in therapeutic proton beams	Animals, Cell Line, Cells,Cultured, Cricetinae, Energy Transfer, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time Factors	To study the effects of a variable relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in inverse treatment planning for proton therapy, fast methods for three-dimensional RBE calculations are required. We therefore propose a simple phenomenological model for the RBE in therapeutic proton beams. It describes the RBE as a function of the dose, the linear energy transfer (LET) and tissue specific parameters. Published experimental results for the dependence of the parameters alpha and beta from the linear-quadratic model on the dose averaged LET were evaluated. Using a linear function for alpha(LET) in the relevant LET region below 30 keV per micrometre and a constant beta, a simple formula for the RBE could be derived. The new model was able to reproduce the basic dependences of RBE on dose and LET, and the RBE values agreed well with experimental results. The model was also applied to spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBP), where the main effects of a variable RBE are an increase of the RBE along the SOBP plateau, and a shift in depth of the distal falloff. The new method allows fast RBE estimations and has therefore potential applications in iterative treatment planning for proton therapy	
945	Interpolation and extrapolation of dose measurements with different detector sizes to improve the spatial resolution of radiotherapy dosimetry as demonstrated for helical tomotherapy	Biophysics, Calibration, Film Dosimetry, Heat, Humans, Ions, Models,Theoretical, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, Statistics as Topic/mt [Methods], Tomography/mt [Methods]	A new technique for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery is helical tomotherapy (HT). Like most IMRT delivery methods, HT utilizes many small fields as part of the treatment plan, which can be difficult to characterize. A novel technique for small field characterization, based on inter- and extrapolation of ion chamber readings, is presented in the context of HT. As a fan beam is characterized by its thickness and output factor, plane parallel chambers with different active volumes were used to scan the fan beam profiles. The fan beam thickness (FBT) can be determined from the thickness measured with the chamber by extrapolating to an infinitesimally small chamber size. The effective output was derived from the integral under the dose profile divided by the FBT. This was done for five FBTs and demonstrated a sharp fall off in dose when the FBT decreased below 8 mm. Similar techniques can be applied to other IMRT techniques to improve the characterization of various beam parameters

Yet, accumulating evidence shows that radiation-induced cycle perturbations and mitotic delay influence the yield of aberrations detectable in mitosis. In extended time-course studies a drastic increase in the number of aberrations with sampling time has been observed after particle irradiation, while after the exposure to sparsely ionizing radiation a less pronounced effect has been found. This difference in the time-course of chromosomal damage is particularly important for the determination of accurate RBE values. As will be discussed, meaningful RBE values for particles can only be obtained, if cells are analysed at multiple sampling times and the complete time-course of aberrations is considered. Otherwise, particle-induced damage will be over- or underestimated. Moreover, depending on the cell system chosen for the analysis, factors like the loss of damaged cells due to apoptosis or a permanent cell cycle arrest complicate the determination of accurate RBE values based on chromosome data	
4024	Analysis of cytotoxicity of 131I-labelled OC125 F(ab')2 on human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines	Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adult, Boston, Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cystadenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Isotopes, Ovarian Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Women, X-Ray Therapy	Monoclonal antibody (mAb) OC125 detects the cell surface-antigen CA125, which is expressed in more than 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers but not in normal adult ovaries. Its high specificity and binding affinity makes OC125 a potential candidate for use in radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Initial biodistribution studies using radiolabelled specific mAbs have demonstrated significant increase in tumor uptake of dose as compared to radiolabelled irrelevant antibody. We report here an isodose comparison of the cytotoxicity of 131I-labelled OC125 F(ab')2, 131I-labelled nonspecific protein and external beam irradiation using a cesium-137 gamma source. Enhancement of cytotoxity due to the specific binding of the mAb could only be observed when a critical activity of 131I localized at the cell membrane. At a specific activity labelling of less than 4.1 mCi/mg, the antigen specificity of OC125 does not contribute to cell kill. Using a specific activity of 10.2 mCi/mg, the relative biological effectiveness of 131I-labelled OC125 (F(ab')2 was increased by a factor of 5 compared with external-beam X-ray therapy, and the specificity of mAb OC125 was found to enhance the cytotoxicity of the radioimmunoconjugate (RIC) by a factor of 2.7. This low value is in accordance with previously reported theoretical calculations for long range, low-LET isotopes and may be one of the reasons why RIT using 131I has severe limitations. In conclusion, it is necessary to maximize the specific activity of RICs with low-LET isotopes such as iodine-131 in order to maximize the ratio of the dose delivered specifically by membrane-bound mAb versus free-floating nonspecific protein	
4726	Margins for treatment planning of proton therapy	Head, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Motion, Normal Distribution, Photons, Physics, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Risk, Time Factors, Uncertainty	For protons and other charged particles, the effect of set-up errors on the position of isodoses is considerably less in the direction of the incident beam than it is laterally. Therefore, the margins required between the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) can be less in the direction of the incident beam than laterally. Margins have been calculated for a typical head plan and a typical prostate plan, for a single field, a parallel opposed and a four-field arrangement of protons, and compared with margins calculated for photons, assuming identical geometrical uncertainties for each modality. In the head plan, where internal motion was assumed negligible, the CTV-PTV margin reduced from approximately 10 mm to 3 mm in the axial direction for the single field and parallel opposed plans. For a prostate plan, where internal motion cannot be ignored, the corresponding reduction in margin was from 11 mm to 7 mm. The planning organ at risk (PRV) margin in the axial direction reduced from 6 mm to 2 mm for the head plan, and from 7 mm to 4 mm for the prostate plan. No reduction was seen on the other axes, or for any axis of the four-field plans. Owing to the shape of proton dose distributions, there are many clinical cases in which good dose distributions can be obtained with one or two fields. When this is done, it is possible to use smaller PTV and PRV margins. This has the potential to convert untreatable cases, in which the PTV and PRV overlap, into cases with a gap between PTV and PRV of adequate size for treatment planning	
4239	W value measurements for protons in tissue-equivalent gas and its constituent gases	Animals, Carbon, Gases, Humans, Nitrogen, Protons, Radiation, Radiation/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reading, Thermodynamics, Uncertainty	Values of W (the mean energy required to create an ion pair when a charged particle is stopped in a gas) are needed in radiation dosimetry to convert ionisation chamber current readings to absorbed dose. For neutron dosimetry the most important W values are those for protons, and this paper describes absolute measurements for protons with energies between 1.2 and 3.5 MeV for methane-based tissue-equivalent gas and its constituent gases, i.e. methane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. An ionisation chamber with a parallel-plate arrangement was used to determine the integrated charge created by a measured number of protons, and W values were determined with an estimated uncertainty of about +/- 0.5%. The results are presented and compared with previous measurements. In general the present data tend to be somewhat lower than previously reported values. Finally the accuracy of a formula for predicting W values for gas mixtures from the values for the individual constituents is investigated

Irradiation geometries are AP and PA exposure. Calculations are carried out using 5 isocentered beams with different sizes to investigate the beam sizes effect on the effective dose. The results show that the effective doses depend not only on the energy of incident particle but also on the exposure position and the beam size on the body

This study confirms the applicability of the fluence-convolution method for dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) dose calculations and evaluates the impact of set-up uncertainties on a clinical IMRT dose distribution. BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes were used for Monte Carlo calculations. A sliding window IMRT delivery was simulated using a dynamic multi-leaf collimator (DMLC) transport model developed by Keall et al. The dose distributions were benchmarked for dynamic IMRT fields using extended dose range (EDR) film, accumulating the dose from 16 subsequent fractions shifted randomly. Agreement of calculated and measured relative dose values was well within statistical uncertainty. A clinical seven field sliding window IMRT head and neck treatment was then simulated and the effects of random set-up errors (standard deviation of 2 mm) were evaluated. The dose-volume histograms calculated in the PTV with and without corrections for RSE showed only small differences indicating a reduction of the volume of high dose region due to set-up errors. As well, it showed that adequate coverage of the PTV was maintained when RSE was incorporated. Slice-by-slice comparison of the dose distributions revealed differences of up to 5.6%. The incorporation of set-up errors altered the position of the hot spot in the plan. This work demonstrated validity of implementation of the fluence-convolution method to dynamic IMRT Monte Carlo dose calculations. It also showed that accounting for the set-up errors could be essential for correct identification of the value and position of the hot spot

Measurements made of dosimetric parameters included central axis depth-dose, field-size factors, wedge factors, penumbra, and leaf leakage for the 6-MV and 15-MV photon beams available on this accelerator. The depth-dose characteristics, output factors, and transmission factors were similar to those reported in the literature for a machine by the same manufacturer with a standard treatment head. Because of scalloping, the effective penumbra for the MLC was 3 to 4 mm wider than that for the conventional collimator jaws. The output for the fields shaped by the MLC was generally lower than that for similar fields shaped with Lipowitz's metal (Cerrobend). The magnitude of the difference was field-size dependent and ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% for open shaped fields, increasing to 1% to 5% in the presence of wedges. Further analysis of this observation has shown it to be primarily due to differences in the scattered radiation from the collimator head

The electron beams produced by such linacs are collimated by special Perspex applicators of various size and cylindrically shaped. The biggest problems from the dosimetric point of view are caused by the high dose-per-pulse values and the use of inclined applicators. In this work measurements of absolute dose for the inclined applicators were done by using a small cylindrical ionization chamber, type CC01 (Wellhofer), a parallel plane ionization chamber type Markus (PTW 23343) and radiochromic films type EBT. We show a method which allows calculating the quality correction factors for CC01 chamber with an uncertainty of 1% and the absolute dose value for the inclined applicators using CC01 with an uncertainty of 3.1% for electron beams of energy of 6 and 7 MeV produced by the linac dedicated to IORT Novac7

The observation period was less than 2 years for 4 cases, 2 to 5 years for 10 cases, 5 to 10 years for 7 cases and more than 10 years for 3 cases. Reabsorption of retinal detachment without any recurrency was obtained for all the cases. The V.A. was increased in 16 cases, did not change in 4 cases and decreased in 4 other cases. Final V.A. was 6/7.5 or more in 9 cases (37.5%), 6/60 a 6/7.5 in 6 cases (25%), and 6/60 or less in 9 cases (37.5%). None of the cases we treated presented complications induced by radiotherapy (actinic papillitis, circulatory disturbances in the macular area, or neovascular glaucoma). The comparison of the results we obtained with cases treated by photocoagulation or external radiotherapy demonstrated a slight advantage in favour of the focalized radiotherapy, which is not statistically significant because of the small number of cases included in the studies. Meanwhile, contact radiotherapy and irradiation with an accelerated proton beam seems to be a substantial alternative for the treatment of large hemangiomas and tumors invading the macula.

[Review] [26 refs]	Animals, Bystander Effect, Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Communication/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Risk, Risk Assessment, Signal Transduction, Sister Chromatid Exchange	It is now apparent that the target for the biological effects of ionizing radiation (IR) is not solely the irradiated cell(s), but also includes the surrounding cells/tissue as well. Radiation-induced bystander effects (BSEs) are defined by the presence of the biological effects of radiation in cells that were not themselves in the field of irradiation. Decreased plating efficiency, increased sister chromatid exchanges, oncogenic transformation, among other endpoints have been used to describe the BSE. Two primary means have been established for the transmission of the bystander signal; one is mediated by gap-junction intracellular communication, and the other is initiated through the secretion of factors from irradiated cells. While the basis for these phenomena have been established in cell culture systems, there is also evidence for their presence in vivo. This in vivo effect may contribute to increased tumor cell killing, and may also play a role in the abscopal effects of radiation, where radiation responses are seen in areas separated from the irradiated tissue. Although the precise molecular components and mechanisms remain unknown, their discovery will shed new light on the role of the BSEs in radiation risk assessment, and clinical radiotherapy in the clinic.

3599	Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors: spinal theca irradiation	Bone Marrow, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Growth/re [Radiation Effects], Heart, Humans, Liver, Lung, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Neuroectodermal Tumors,Primitive/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Spine/re [Radiation Effects], Survival, Switzerland, Thyroid Gland, Universities, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conventional postoperative photon-beam radiotherapy to the spine in children with medulloblastoma/PNET is associated with severe late effects. This morbidity (growth and developmental) is related to the exit dose of the beams and is particularly severe in young children. With the purpose of reducing this toxicity, a dosimetric study was undertaken in which proton therapy was compared to standard megavoltage photon treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The results of a comparative dosimetric study are presented in such a way that the dose distribution achievable with a posterior modulated 100 MeV proton beam (spot scanning method) is compared with that of a standard set of posterior 6 MV x-ray fields. The potential improvements with protons are evaluated, using dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the target as well as the dose to the vertebral bodies (growth plates), lungs, heart, and liver. RESULTS: The target (i.e., the spinal dural sac) received the full prescribed dose in both treatment plans. However, the proportions of the vertebral body volume receiving > or = 50% of the prescribed dose were 100 and 20% for 6 MV x-rays and protons, respectively. For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET. The potential bone marrow and growth arrest sparing effects make this approach specially attractive for intensive chemotherapy protocols and for very young children. Sparing the thyroid gland, the posterior heart wall, and the gonads may be additional advantages in assuring a long-term posttreatment morbidity-free survival

At least a 13 grays (Gy) irradiation dose has to be used, but high morbidity is observed in case of over 11 Gy irradiation. So, no therapeutic windows have been found despite the fact that more than 900 patients were included in clinical trials. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) uses alpha emitting nuclear reactions, produced within tumoral cells by boron neutron captures. (10)B is specifically loaded inside tumoral cells via a boronated molecule, and the tissues are then irradiated with thermal or epithermal neutrons. Although this type of irradiation is yet considered as a regular method in Japan, USA and Europe have started clinical trials, currently in progress, in order to define the BNCT place in the post-operative care of high grade glioma. Non-removable tumors may benefit from boron neutron capture enhancement of fast neutron irradiation, i.e. the combination of these two methods. Preliminary studies show that a "biological" dose enhancement of 20 % could be obtained within the tumor when a concentration of 100 microg/g of (10)B is targeted into it. These concentrations are achievable by intra-arterial administration of (10)boronophenylalanine (BPA) or borosulfhydryl (BSH). Recently, some publications have also demonstrated that the thermal neutron flux yielded within the irradiated tissues could be increased. Clinical trials, using this technique, are planned in USA and Europe	
377	Image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery using a specially designed high-dose-rate linac.

In this study, we describe a high-dose-rate output accelerator as a part of our stereotactic IGRT delivery system. The linac is a Siemens Oncor without a flattening filter, and enables dose rates to reach 1000 monitor units (MUs) per minute. Even at this high-dose-rate, the linac dosimetry system remains robust; constancy, linearity, and beam energy remain within 1% for 3 to 1000 MU. Dose profiles for larger field sizes are not flat, but they are radially symmetric and, as such, able to be modeled by a treatment planning system. Target localization is performed via optical guidance utilizing a 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound probe coupled to an array of 4 infrared light-emitting diodes. These diodes are identified by a fixed infrared camera system that determines diode position and, by extension, all objects imaged in the room coordinate system. This system provides sub-millimeter localization accuracy for cranial applications and better than 1.5 mm for extracranial applications. Because stereotactic IGRT can require significantly longer times for treatment delivery, the advantages of the high-dose-rate design and its direct impact on IGRT are discussed. [References: 40]

This assumption was also supported by positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET). In contrast, proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) indicated radiation necrosis, which was confirmed histopathologically in surgical specimens. Subsequent follow-up examinations up to 19 months after surgery showed no evidence of tumor recurrence

[French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Argon, Brachytherapy, Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Hemangioma/su [Surgery], Humans, Laser Coagulation, Male, Middle Aged, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Therapeutic retrospective results obtained after Argon laser photocoagulation of 17 circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas associated with serous retinal detachment were analyzed. All patients were symptomatic but one. Duration of visual symptoms varied from 2 weeks to 3 years. Mean tumor thickness was 3,3mm (1 to 6,5mm). Mean tumor diameter was 6,5mm (2.5 to 15mm). Tumors were juxtapapillary in 9 cases (57%). The mean distance from the fovea was 1,5mm (0 to 3mm), and the fovea was pathological in all cases but two. The tumoral surface was covered by Argon laser spots with the central avascular area spared in the case of subfoveal hemangioma. In the case of subretinal fluid persistence 3 months later, 1 or more photocoagulation sessions were carried out. Follow-up was 27 months (6 to 156 months). RESULTS: Success (complete subretinal fluid resolution) was obtained in 82.4% with 1 or 2 laser photocoagulation sessions. Recurrence was observed in 4 cases (23.5%) but treated with success. Final visual acuity, related to the initial foveal condition, was >=0.5 in 23.5% of cases, and >=0.1 in 70.6% of cases. DISCUSSION: Anatomical and functional results were satisfactory considering initial foveal conditions. Irradiation (external beam irradiation, proton beam therapy, brachytherapy) has been used with success for several years. However, radiation-induced damage was described in addition to a few practical disadvantages. CONCLUSION: Argon laser photocoagulation was an effective noninvasive therapy for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. It remains for us the reference method for treating this tumor	
1577	Considerations of marrow cellularity in 3-dimensional dosimetric models of the trabecular skeleton	Adipocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Bone and Bones/re [Radiation Effects], Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/pa [Pathology], Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Cadaver, Femur Head/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Humerus/re [Radiation Effects], Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry, Reference Values, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Dose assessment to active bone marrow is a critical feature of radionuclide therapy treatment planning. Skeletal dosimetry models currently used to assign radionuclide S values for clinical marrow dose assessment are based on bone and marrow cavity chord-length distributions. Accordingly, these models cannot explicitly consider energy loss to inactive marrow (adipose tissue) during particle transport across the trabecular marrow space (TMS). One method to account for this energy loss is to uniformly scale the resulting TMS absorbed fractions by reference values of site-specific marrow cellularity. In doing so, however, the resulting absorbed fractions for self-irradiation of the trabecular active marrow (TAM) do not converge to unity at low electron source energies. This study attempts to address this issue by using nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy images of trabecular bone to define 3-dimensional (3D) dosimetric models in which explicit spatial distributions of adipose tissue are introduced. METHODS: Cadaveric sources of trabecular bone were taken from both the femoral heads and humeral epiphyses of a 51-y-old male subject. The bone sites were sectioned and subsequently imaged at a proton resonance frequency of 200 MHz (4.7 T) using a 3D spin-echo pulse sequence. After image segmentation, voxel clusters of adipocytes were inserted interior to the marrow cavities of the binary images, which were then coupled to the EGS4 radiation transport code for simulation of active marrow electron sources. RESULTS: Absorbed fractions for self-irradiation of the TAM were tabulated for both skeletal sites. Substantial variations in the absorbed fraction to active marrow are seen with changes in marrow cellularity, particularly in the energy range of 100-500 keV. These variations are seen to be more dramatic in the humeral epiphysis (larger marrow volume fraction) than in the femoral head. CONCLUSION: Results from electron transport in 3D models of the trabecular skeleton indicate that current methods to account for marrow cellularity in chord-based models are incomplete. At 10 keV, for example, the Eckerman and Stabin model underestimates the self-absorbed fraction to active marrow by 75%. At 1 MeV, the model of Bouchet et al. overestimates this same value by 40%. In the energy range of 20-200 keV, neither model accurately predicts energy loss to the active bone marrow. Thus, it is proposed that future extensions of skeletal dosimetry models use 3D transport techniques in which explicit delineation of active and inactive marrow is feasible	
2381	Breakaway safety feature for an intra-oral cone system	Brachytherapy/is [Instrumentation], Equipment Safety, Humans, Mouth Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Particle Accelerators, Pressure, Radiotherapy, Safety	With an increasing number of high energy accelerators in operation, intra-oral electron radiotherapy is likely to become a more widely-used modality in the treatment of lesions of the oral cavity. However, there is one potential problem associated with this modality which concerns patient safety. There must never be any uncontrolled movement of the couch or gantry while the cone is in the patient's mouth, otherwise serious consequences could occur. In an effort to overcome this problem, a set of cones previously constructed by us for use in intra-oral electron radiotherapy has been modified to include a breakaway safety feature. This modification consists of separating the plate into which each of the treatment cones screws, into two pieces, the dividing line being in the shape of a cone frustum flaring out in the upward direction. A set of four spring plungers projecting into a notch on the inner ring prevents the cone from being pushed upwards without the application of an upward force. The amount of force required to push the cone upwards can be changed by adjusting the pressure of the spring plungers

4260	Biological aspects of high LET radiation therapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Neutrons, Oxygen, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research	Biological information suggests that high LET radiations could be used advantageously in radiation therapy. The radiation responses of cells and tissues are described in general terms with respect to the following aspects of high LET radiations considered for therapeutic use: spatial distribution of biological effect, oxygen enhancement of cell lethality in mixed LET radiation beams, dependence of oxygen enhancement of cell lethality upon the microscopic distribution of energy loss, gain factors due to relative biological effectiveness alone, and recovery from sublethal cellular damage. It is concluded that there is no single advantage to the use of high LET radiations in radiation therapy, but that combinations of advantages may exist for different radiations and different tumor-normal tissue combinations. Cases in which inverse gain factors occur are to be avoided

Particle radiations, including both proton and helium-ion beams, have been used to successfully treat choroidal melanoma, but with the complication of radiation-induced cataract. We have investigated a role for radiation-induced changes in the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) gene expression as part of the mechanism(s) underlying lens cell injury associated with cataract. Normal human lens epithelial (HLE) cells were cultured in vitro on extracellular matrix (ECM) originated from bovine corneal endothelial cells. This study reports evidence for rapid but transient induction of FGF2 transcripts, an increase of between 5- and 8-fold, within 0.5 h after exposure to particle radiation, followed by another wave of increased transcription at 2-3 h postirradiation. Immunofluorescence results confirm the enhanced levels of FGF2 protein rapidly after exposure to protons or helium ions, followed by another wave of increased activity unique to helium at 6 h postirradiation. This second wave of increased immunoreactivity was not observed in the proton-irradiated samples. Total FGF2 protein analysis after helium-ion exposures shows induced expression of three FGF2 isoforms, with an increase of up to 2-fold in the 18-kDa low-molecular-weight species. Studies of the effects of protons on individual FGF2 protein isoforms are in progress. Several mechanisms involving a role for FGF2 in radiation-induced cataract are discussed	
3176	No association between p53 status and alpha-particle-induced chromosomal instability in human lymphoblastoid cells	Alpha Particles, Base Sequence, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow Cells, Cell Line, Cells,Cultured, Chromosomal Instability, Chromosome Aberrations, Consensus, DNA, Genes,p53, Humans, Lead, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Molecular Sequence Data, Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/ch [Chemistry], Radiobiology, Research, Time Factors, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/me [Metabolism]	Previous work has demonstrated that alpha-particle irradiation of primary human bone marrow cells leads to the transmission of chromosomal instability in the descendants of the irradiated cell, although there is some interindividual variation. We have extended these studies to human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines in order to establish an in vitro model system. The five cell lines analyzed, including one from a Fanconi anaemia patient, exhibited high levels of persistent chromatid aberrations up to approximately 40 cell generations after alpha-irradiation. The p53 status of the cell lines was defined according to whether cellular p53 levels were induced by irradiation, translocated to the nucleus and were able to bind a p53 DNA consensus recognition sequence in vitro. Together with the primary bone marrow cell studies, we conclude that alpha-particle induced chromosomal instability is independent of the p53 status of the cell as defined in these studies	
4498	Shielding and radiation safety around a superconducting cyclotron neutron therapy facility	Cyclotrons, Humans, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Safety	Prior to routine operation of the neutron therapy unit a radiation survey was performed in order to confirm the shielding design and to assure the safety of the personnel involved in the operation of the unit. The shielding requirements were calculated in accordance with NCRP Report No. 51. The contributions of the neutron and gamma dose equivalents have been measured separately outside the treatment room. The exposure outside the shield is negligible. In general, the measured values were lower than those derived from the shielding calculations. The highest total dose equivalents were registered at locations corresponding to the highest calculated values	
3700	Dosimetric parameters of a modified set of wedges for use with asymmetric fields of a 6 MV linear accelerator	Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Universities, Washington	A set of standard wedge filters has been modified for use with half-collimated beams of a 6 MV linear accelerator. The position of the standard size wedge filter has been shifted as far to one side of the wedge plate to ensure optimum half-collimated field coverage (up to 20 x 30 cm) required in certain clinical situations. Dosimetric parameters were normalized at 1.5 cm depth and at an off-axis reference point (3.5 cm from the central axis of the collimator at 100 cm SSD. The shapes of the wedged profile and isodose curves of the modified wedges remained similar to those of standard wedges. Data presented include wedge transmission factors, wedge angles, beam profiles, and isodose distributions. The clinical advantages of using modified wedge filters (larger field size, larger transmission, and smaller weight) over standard large wedges is discussed	
2231	Analytic modeling of photon scatter from flattening filters in photon therapy beams	Eye, Head, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Sweden	Analytic models for calculation of scatter distributions from flattening filters in therapy photon beams are presented. It is shown that the amount of scatter with high atomic number filters can vary from 2% in 4-MV beams to 10% for 24-MV beams. The use of low atomic number filters can increase the amount of scatter by a factor of 2. The dependence on the opening angle of the primary collimator is quite large since a larger opening angle requires a thicker filter, which increases the scattered fraction of the filtered beam. The scatter makes the filter act as an extended source of extra-focal radiation. The source distribution for monomedia filters is shown to be almost triangular. Integration in the calculation-point's eye view over the visible part of the filter scatter source yields the scatter fraction of the total energy fluence incident upon the patient. The experimentally well-known "tilt" of dose profiles for asymmetrical fields is explained by the model. For complete modeling of head scatter distributions in treatment planning, the model presented must be combined with models also describing the scatter from the collimators, auxiliary modulators such as wedges and compensating filters, and collimator backscatter to the beam monitor	
2419	The Clatterbridge high-energy neutron therapy facility: specification and performance	Beryllium, Calibration, Equipment Design, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Head, Humans, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radioactivity, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Rotation, Water	A new high-energy neutron therapy facility has been installed at the Douglas Cyclotron Centre, Clatterbridge Hospital, Merseyside, in order to extend the clinical trials of fast neutrons initiated by the Medical Research Council. The neutron beam is produced by bombarding a beryllium target with 62 MeV protons. The target is isocentrically mounted with the potential for 360 degrees rotation and has a fully variable collimator. This gives a range of rectilinear field sizes from 5 cm x 5 cm to 30 cm x 30 cm. Basic neutron beam data including output, field flatness, penumbra and depth-dose data have been measured. For a 10 cm x 10 cm field, the 50% depth dose occurs at 16.2 cm in water and the output is 1.63 cGy microA-1 min-1 at the depth of dose maximum. The effectiveness of the target shielding and the neutron-induced radioactivity in the treatment head have also been measured. It is concluded that the equipment meets both the design specifications and also fully satisfies criticisms of earlier neutron therapy equipment. A full radiation survey of the centre was also carried out and it was found that radiation levels are low and present no significant hazard to staff	
4673	In-beam PET at high-energy photon beams: a feasibility study	Adipose Tissue/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Bone and Bones/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Carbon, Electrons, Feasibility Studies, Germany, Humans, Isotopes, Isotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Japan, Motion, Muscles/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Photons, Positron-Emission Tomography, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation	For radiation therapy with carbon ion beams, either for the stable isotope (12)C or for the radioactive one (11)C, it has been demonstrated that the beta(+)-activity distribution created or deposited, respectively, within the irradiated volume can be visualized by means of positron emission tomography (PET). The PET images provide valuable information for quality assurance and precision improvement of ion therapy. Dedicated PET scanners have been integrated into treatment sites at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator at Chiba (HIMAC), Japan, and the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Germany, to make PET imaging feasible during therapeutic irradiation (in-beam PET). A similar technique may be worthwhile for radiotherapy with high-energy bremsstrahlung. In addition to monitoring the dose delivery process which in-beam PET has been primarily developed for, it may be expected that radiation response of tissue can be detected by means of in-beam PET. We investigate the applicability of PET for treatment control in the case of using bremsstrahlung spectra produced by 15-50 MeV electrons. Target volume activation due to (gamma, n) reactions at energies above 20 MeV yields moderate beta(+)-activity levels, which can be employed for imaging. The radiation from positrons produced by pair production is not presently usable because the detectors are overloaded due to the low duty factor of medical electron linear accelerators. However, the degradation of images caused by positron motion between creation and annihilation seems to be tolerable	
3205	Calculating the angular standard deviation of electron beams using Fermi-Eyges theory	Air, Australia, Biophysics, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Knowledge, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Scattering,Radiation	Knowledge of the angular distribution of an electron beam at the applicator face is a necessary parameter in defining a beam when the Hogstrom pencil beam method of dose calculation is used. The angular spread can be found experimentally using penumbra widths measured at various distances from the applicator face. Using knowledge of the geometry and composition of the scattering foils of the linear accelerator, the angular standard deviation was calculated theoretically using Fermi-Eyges theory. The obtained angular spread values agree with experimentally derived values to within experimental error for electron energies from 6 to 21 MeV. The Fermi-Eyges calculation is fast, and can be used as a quick check to validate experimental angular spread values	
1524	Stereotactic synchrotron microbeam radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Equipment Design/mt [Methods], Equipment Design/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Head, Humans, Models,Biological, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity, Stereotaxic Techniques, Synchrotrons/is [Instrumentation]	Highly collimated synchrotron x-ray beams with high fluence rate may be used in stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumours. Several monochromatic x-ray beams having uniform microscopic thickness ie (microplanar beams) are directed to the center of the tumour from varying directions, delivering lethal dose to the target volume while sparing normal cells. This proposed technique takes advantage of the hypothesised repair mechanism of capillaries between closely spaced microplanar beam zones. The sharply dropping lateral dose profile of a microplanar beam provides low scattered dose to the off-target interbeam volume. In close proximity to the target volume, relatively high secondary electron doses close to the edge of the beams overlap and produce a high dose region between angled beams. This allows precise targeting and prevents gradual blurring of the higher and lower dose margins in the target volume. The advantages of stereotactic microplanar beam radiotherapy will be lost as the dose between microplanar beams exceeds the tolerance dose of the dose limiting tissues. Therefore to minimize the risks of delayed radiation damage it is essential to optimize the interbeam doses inside a human head phantom. The EGS4 Monte Carlo code is used to calculate the lateral dose profiles and depth dose of a 100 keV single microplanar beam in the phantom. A general equation for absorbed dose as a function of depth and lateral distances is derived for the single beam. Several microplanar beams are directed into the target volume at the center of the phantom. Using the equation, maximum dose on the beam axis (primary + total scattered dose) and the minimum interbeam dose (total scattered dose) are calculated at different depths and an isodose map of the phantom is obtained. A stereotactic microplanar beam radiotherapy model is proposed for a 10 mm diameter (approximately spherical) tumour at the center of the phantom

1867	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain following high-dose methotrexate treatment for childhood cancer	Adolescent, Adult, Antimetabolites,Antineoplastic/ae [Adverse Effects], Brain/de [Drug Effects], Brain/pa [Pathology], Case-Control Studies, Central Nervous System Diseases/et [Etiology], Central Nervous System Diseases/pa [Pathology], Central Nervous System Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Child, England, Female, Humans, Leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy], Leukemia/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methotrexate/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Time	BACKGROUND: To avoid the late sequelae associated with cranial radiation therapy in childhood, intermediate- or high-dose intravenous methotrexate (HDMTX) has found increasing application as a means of preventing the development of overt central nervous system disease in childhood acute leukaemia. However, acute and chronic neurotoxicity has been described following HDMTX therapy, and the long-term intellectual outcome in children treated in this way is inadequately documented. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain is a noninvasive, quantitative way of assessing aspects of cerebral metabolism, which has not previously been applied to the study of children undergoing central nervous system directed therapy. PROCEDURE: To evaluate the potential role of (1)H-MRS in the investigation of related neurotoxicity, 11 children who had received HDMTX (cumulative dose 6-96 g/m(2)) underwent localised (1)H-MRS, magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropsychological assessments were performed on the children who had more than 1 year of follow-up time since last methotrexate treatment. Control (1)H-MRS studies on 11 adult and 6 young volunteers were undertaken. Eight patients had spectra of adequate quality. Comparisons between (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios and normal controls were made. RESULTS: Patients had a low choline/water ratio compared to controls (P < 0.01). No differences between patient and control NAA/water, Cr/water, Naa/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios were seen. Overall, 3 patients had abnormal white matter changes on MRI. The mean IQ of the patients (104.1) was in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that choline depletion in the brains of these patients may reflect subclinical disturbances of myelin metabolism as a result of methotrexate therapy and may represent a possible avenue of treatment in patients with clinical chronic methotrexate-related neurotoxicity.

4667	Radiation therapy in the management of locally advanced prostate cancer. [Review] [37 refs]	Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Clinical Trials as Topic, Disease Progression, Humans, Male, Patients, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Risk, Universities, Washington	Locally advanced prostate cancer generally refers to those patients with clinical stages T3-4 disease. Patients with locally advanced cancer frequently are included in clinical trials that examine treatment for patients at high risk for relapse based on presenting prostate-specific antigen, high Gleason score, or advanced clinical stage. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that men with localized prostate cancer benefit from high-dose radiation therapy delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or proton beam therapy. Most importantly, neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy have significantly improved outcomes in men with locally advanced or high-risk prostate cancer. Although questions remain regarding the optimal timing and duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy, a combination of long-term androgen deprivation started before radiation therapy and continued for 2 years represents a North American standard of care for this patient population.

956	Raman spectroscopy of tissue samples irradiated by protons	Animals, Female, Humans, Mice, Neoplasm Transplantation, Protons, Radiation, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Spectrum Analysis,Raman, Swine, Transplantation,Heterologous	PURPOSE: Since the number of cancer patients treated by proton irradiation has increased in the last few years, it seems appropriate to study dose-dependent effects of proton irradiation on mammalian tissues in more detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples of normal skin of mouse and swine, of a human tumour model xenograph, and of normal skin and a skin tumour (basal cell carcinoma) of a human patient of about 1 mm thickness were irradiated by 24 MeV protons (uniform delivered doses of 1, 7 and 50 Gy: skin of mouse and a human tumour model xenograph, and 0.5, 5 and 50 Gy: swine and human skin). Raman spectra of non-irradiated and irradiated samples were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Amide I, P=O and C-O bond vibrations and aromatics were sensitive to the proton irradiation dose. In the C-H stretching region, the irradiation-mediated change of Raman spectra was significant only in the case of the skin tumour. CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that Raman spectroscopy is suited to assess the radiation damage done to biological samples by protons. Proteins of the human skin tumour seem to be more sensitive to proton irradiation than proteins of normal human skin	
2346	Man's sensitivity to bone marrow failure following whole body exposure to low LET ionising radiation: inferences to be drawn from animal experiments	Animals, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Dogs, Female, Goats, Haplorhini, Humans, Lethal Dose 50, Male, Mortality, Perissodactyla, Radiation, Sheep, Species Specificity, Swine, Time, Whole-Body Irradiation/ae [Adverse Effects]	Evidence concerning the sensitivity of man to bone marrow failure following exposure to brief but substantial doses of ionising radiation is sparse. There is, however, a relatively substantial body of information on such effects in large animals. Reported experiments on six species where exposure to low LET radiation was uniform to the whole body and of brief duration (exposure times of the order of one hour or less) have been reanalysed both in terms of exposure and of midline tissue dose. The results indicate a marked lack of homogeneity among values for LD50 within species thus questioning the applicability of LD50 as a species dependent constant. It is, however, suggested that on a purely empirical basis these large animal data suggest that the dose killing 'most' (where 'most' is between 90 and 95 per cent) is about twice that killing 'few' (where 'few' is between 5 and 10 per cent). For man, where there is evidence that the dose killing few is unlikely to be less than 3 Gy, this relationship might indicate a gradient of mortality with dose between 3 and 6 Gy	
743	Proton beam therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective review of 162 patients	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Palliative Care, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: We present results of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with proton beam therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed 162 patients having 192 HCCs treated from November 1985 to July 1998 by proton beam therapy with or without transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. The patients in the present series were considered unsuitable for surgery for various reasons, including hepatic dysfunction, multiple tumors, recurrence after surgical resection, and concomitant illnesses. The median total dose of proton irradiation was 72 Gy in 16 fractions over 29 days. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for all of the 162 patients was 23.5% at 5 years. The local control rate at 5 years was 86.9% for all 192 tumors among the 162 patients. The degree of impairment of hepatic functions attributable to coexisting liver cirrhosis and the number of tumors in the liver significantly affected patient survival. For 50 patients having least impaired hepatic functions and a solitary tumor, the survival rate at 5 years was 53.5%. The patients had very few acute reactions to treatments and a few late sequelae during and after the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC is effective, safe, well tolerable, and repeatable. It is the useful treatment mode for either cure or palliation for patients with HCC irrespective of tumor size, tumor location in the liver, insufficient feeding of the tumor with arteries, presence of vascular invasion, impaired hepatic functions, and coexisting intercurrent diseases

Examples are leaf motion in intensity modulated x-ray therapy, modulator wheel rotation in conventional proton therapy and variable magnet settings in proton beam scanning. Consequently, for Monte Carlo dose calculation the results of several independent simulations usually have to be combined. Depending on the complexity and the required accuracy this can become cumbersome. We present a technique to simulate time-dependent geometries within a single four-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo package. Results for proton therapy applications are shown

The system consists of a scintillating (fluorescent) screen, mounted at the beam-exit side of a phantom and it is observed by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The observed light distribution at the screen is equivalent to the two-dimensional (2D)-dose distribution at the screen position. It has been found that the dosimetric properties of the system, measured in a scanning proton beam, are equal to those measured in a proton beam broadened by a scattering system. Measurements of the transversal dose distribution of a single pencil beam are consistent with dose measurements as well as with dose calculations in clinically relevant fields made with multiple pencil beams. Measurements of inhomogeneous dose distributions have shown to be of sufficient accuracy to be suitable for the verification of dose calculation algorithms. The good sensitivity and sub-mm spatial resolution of the system allows for the detection of deviations of a few percent in dose from the expected (intended or calculated) dose distribution. Its dosimetric properties and the immediate availability of the data make this device a useful tool in the quality control of scanning proton beams

For each type of particle, operational and closed facilities are listed as well as planned new facilities. Improvements in clinical results have always been linked to technological developments and better physical selectivity of the irradiation. Exploring the benefit of further improvement in dose localization expected from protons and conformal therapy is the challenge for the coming years. The radiobiological rationale for high-LET radiation in cancer treatment, proposed in the fifties, is still valid and has not been contradicted by recent radiobiological findings. This justifies the planning of a therapy facility where protons and heavy ions (carbon ions) could be applied, under optimal physical and technical conditions. Appropriate selection between low- and high-LET radiation for a particular tumor is indeed a radiobiological problem, independent of technical development

However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. How we incorporate this effect into the classical models of risk assessment remains an open question. Here, the induction of bystander effect was studied by assessing DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation in situ with the rapid and sensitive gamma-H2AX focus formation assay. Utilising the Columbia University single-cell microbeam system to deliver 2 or 20 individual alpha particles to selected cell nuclei in a precisely known proportion of cells in a population, the induced DNA DSB incidences were quantified 30 min and 18 h post-IR. The increase in DNA DSB incidence in bystander cells lacked of a linear dose response indicating that neither the dose of irradiation nor proportion of irradiated cells in a population, is a critical parameter. This study confirms a binary all-or-nothing model of triggering the bystander response. The delay and persistence of the bystander response suggests a different mechanism of DSB induction in bystander cells than in directly irradiated cells

The convolution/superposition method of dose calculation using Monte-Carlo-generated homogeneous photon kernels is shown to be in error for exit dose calculation. Instead, photon kernels that incorporate modelling of the exit surface were generated, also using Monte Carlo, to analyse the problem, and the calculated dose fall-off using these kernels agrees well with measured data. In addition, the physics underlying the characteristics of the dose fall-off is analysed based on complete Monte Carlo modelling. Practical improvements to the convolution/superposition method are suggested

METHODS: Patients with invasive bladder cancer, stage T2-3N0M0, were included in the study. Intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed with three injections of methotrexate and cisplatin at 3-week intervals. Simultaneously, the patients underwent X-ray irradiation (40 Gy) of the small pelvic space. Where a post-treatment transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy showed no residual tumor, the tumor site was irradiated by a 30 Gy proton beam and the bladder was preserved. Where tumors remained, radical cystectomy was performed. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1996, 42 patients were treated according to this protocol. Post-treatment TUR biopsy and urine cytology showed no residual tumors in 39 of 42 cases (93%). The bladder was preserved in accordance with the study protocol in 36 cases. A median follow-up of 38 months showed 3-year non-recurrence in 72% of bladder-preserved patients and the rate of bladder preservation was 84%. The nine recurrences included eight cases of superficial bladder recurrence. One cancer death occurred among the bladder-preservation patients, giving 3-year survival and cause-specific survival rates of 84% and 100%, respectively. Although bladder function decreased slightly in compliance, bladder capacity was retained in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is useful for bladder preservation in T2-3 locally invasive bladder cancer. Information from more cases and the results of more long-term observations are needed, as is an evaluation of appropriate subject selection and factors associated with quality of life issues, particularly regarding bladder function	
3242	[Clinical investigation of indications in proton therapy]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities, Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The indications for curative treatment with proton therapy were investigated by the clinical results of 31 cancer patients treated with proton beams between 1983 and 1985 at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center of Tsukuba University. Many locally extended, radioresistant lesions, lesions with large volume and small radiocurable lesions in this series revealed sufficient improvement without definite late damage in the surrounding normal tissues. This clinical result suggests that proton beam treatment could be applied to lesions in a much wider range for curative purposes as compared with conventional radiotherapy. This study is to be continued further	
4349	Neoplastic diseases induced by chronic alpha-irradiation--epidemiological, biophysical and clinical results of the German Thorotrast Study	Adolescent, Adult, Alpha Particles, Bone Marrow, Child, Child,Preschool, Contrast Media, Contrast Media/ae [Adverse Effects], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany/ep [Epidemiology], Humans, Infant, Larynx, Liver, Lymphoma, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Sarcoma, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Women	The intravascular injection of the formerly used contrast medium Thorotrast--a colloidal suspension of thorium-dioxide--causes a chronic exposure to alpha-particles especially in the organs of the reticuloendothelial system. The German Thorotrast Study comprises 2326 Thorotrast patients and 1890 contemporary matched patients in the control group to be evaluated. 899 Thorotrast patients and 662 controls had clinical and biophysical follow-up examinations every two years since 1969. The recent most important results of the study are: A high excess rate of primary liver cancer (410/2) was observed beginning after the 15th year of exposure. 31% of the tumors are combined with cirrhosis and 6% with other neoplastic diseases. A clear (mean) dose rate effect relationship exists. The tumor frequency depends on the time of exposure or the cumulative dose to the liver respectively and not primarily on the age at injection. The lowest cumulative doses at 10 years before diagnosis of liver cancer were about 2 Gy. Risk estimates for liver cancer after 40 years of exposure are 500 malignant tumors per 10(4) person-Gy for men and 300 for women. A high excess rate exists also for leukaemias (excluding CLL) starting already 5 years after Thorotrast injection (39/4). The lowest cumulative doses to the red bone marrow at time of death were about 0.5 Gy. According to the present result, an excess rate can be expected for carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, oesophagus, larynx, as well as Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, bone sarcomas, plasmacytomas and mesotheliomas	
4681	In vitro studies of the genotoxicity of ionizing radiation in human G(0) T lymphocytes	Cell Division, Cell Proliferation, Cells,Cultured, Cesium Radioisotopes, Chromosome Painting, DNA, DNA Repair, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, G0 Phase/re [Radiation Effects], Gene Deletion, Humans, Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/ge [Genetics], Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/re [Radiation Effects], Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Mutagenicity Tests, Mutation, Radiation, Radiation,Ionizing, Radioisotopes, Radon, Research, T-Lymphocytes/cy [Cytology], T-Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Universities	In an effort to mimic human in vivo exposures to ionizing irradiation, G(0) phase T lymphocytes from human peripheral blood samples were utilized for in vitro studies of the genotoxic effects of (137)Cs low-LET irradiation and (222)Rn high-LET irradiation. Both types of radiation induced mutations in the HPRT gene in a dose-dependent manner, with a mutant frequency (MF) = 4.28 + 1.34x + 7.51x(2) for (137)Cs (R(2) = 0.95) and MF = 4.81 + 0.67x for (222)Rn (R(2) = 0.51). Post (137)Cs irradiation incubation in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, a reversible inhibitor of DNA repair, caused an increase in the MF over irradiation alone, consistent with a misrepair mechanism being involved in the mutagenicity of low-LET irradiation. The spectrum of (137)Cs irradiation-induced mutation displayed an increase in macro-deletions (in particular total gene deletions) and rearrangement events, some of which were further defined by either chromosome painting or direct DNA sequencing. The spectrum of (222)Rn irradiation-induced mutation was characterized by an increase in small alterations, especially multiple single base deletions/substitutions and micro-deletions. These studies define the specific response of human peripheral blood T cells to ionizing irradiation in vitro and form a basis for evaluating the genotoxic effects of human in vivo exposure	
705	Calculations of neutron dose equivalent exposures from range-modulated proton therapy beams	Cyclotrons, Humans, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation	Passive beam spreading techniques have been used for most proton therapy treatments worldwide. This delivery method employs static scattering foils to spread the beam laterally and a range modulating wheel or ridge filter to spread the high dose region in depth to provide a uniform radiation dose to the treatment volume. Neutrons produced by interactions of the treatment beam with nozzle components, such as the range modulation wheel, can account for a large portion of the secondary dose delivered to healthy tissue outside the treatment volume. Despite this fact, little is known about the effects of range modulation on the secondary neutron exposures around passively scattered proton treatment nozzles. In this work, the neutron dose equivalent spectra per incident proton (H(E)/p) and total neutron dose equivalent per therapeutic absorbed dose (H/D) were studied using Monte Carlo techniques for various values of range modulation at 54 locations around a passive scattering proton therapy treatment nozzle. As the range modulator wheel step thickness increased from 1.0 to 11.5 cm, the peak values of H(E)/p decreased from approximately 1 x 10(-17) mSv Gy(-1) to approximately 2 x 10(-18) mSv Gy(-1) at 50 cm from isocentre along the beam's central axis. In general, H/D increased with increasing range modulation at all locations studied, and the maximum H/D exposures shifted away from isocentre	
2794	[The improved determination of the dose rate in irregular photon fields]. [German]	Diaphragm, Head, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Time, Time Factors	A revised formula for calculation of dose per time or monitor unit ("dose rate") of irregular megavoltage photon beams is proposed. The formula considers additionally the shading by secondary shieldings of the plane source describing the scattered radiation in the head. Therefore, in addition to the primary output factor C(ac) as function of the equivalent square ac x ac of the collimator field size a secondary output factor S(as) is introduced denoted as function of the equivalent square as x as of the irregular field. S is determined using a satellite diaphragm formed of shielding blocks in combination with a totally opened collimator. In this definition, S includes both the effects of radiation scattered in tissue (phantom scatter factor PSF) and of missing photons from the plane source by the blocks (satellite diaphragm factor SAT). In the usual formula to calculate the "dose rate" (output) at reference point in depth t, PSF is replaced by S: D = D0 x C(ac) x [PSF(as)/PSF(ac)] x T x R(as,t). There T is representing the block tray factor and R(as,t) the tissue phantom ratio or relative depth dose, depending on the irradiation technique used. Thus the modified formula is given by D = D0 x C(ac) x [S(as)/S(ac)] x T x R(as,t). Measurements show that the revised formula provides an additional precision of up to 2% in the calculation of dose, depending on the type of accelerator respectively on the size of the plane source of scattered radiation

External audit on output calibration for photon beams	Belgium, Calibration, Cesium Radioisotopes, Cesium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Europe, Gamma Rays, Health Physics, Humans, Medical Audit, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Photons, Policy Making, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation Monitoring/st [Standards], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Reading, Research, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Universities, X-Rays	The EROPAQ project for TLD monitoring of photon beams started in June 1994 with the set-up of the TLD system: calibration, reading and evaluation procedures. The acceptance level of +/- 3% was set for the TLD intercomparisons. The policy of the project was to check all beams in 47 participating radiotherapy centres and to recheck all the beams in those centres, where a deviation exceeding +/- 3% occurred in one or more of the beams. Out of 129 beams checked, 100 beams (78%) were found within the +/- 3% limit. Eleven beams show deviations larger than +/- 6%, and immediate corrective action was undertaken. Out of 47 centres checked, 22 did not participate in any external audit in a preceding 5 years. In these centres 68% (34/50) of the total number of gamma and x-ray beams checked but only 59% (20/34) of gamma beams were within the acceptance level, while in the 25 centres, which participated in an external audit before, these figures were 84% (66/79) and 88% (35/40) respectively. The sources of discrepancies were thoroughly investigated, discussed with the participants and the errors corrected. Poor results were in several cases associated with very old design of radiotherapy units and old dosimetry systems, equipped with inadequate ionization chambers. In several centres, an insufficient training of the physicists in clinical dosimetry was observed. Thanks to the corrective action, a great improvement of calibration of the beams was achieved. Standard deviation of the distribution of the results for all x and gamma beams checked decreased from SD = 7.4% at the first check to SD = 2.5% at the second check	
136	Comparative treatment planning between proton and x-ray therapy in esophageal cancer	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage x-rays and protons for five patients with esophageal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of x-rays. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma	
3479	Radithor and the era of mild radium therapy.[see comment]	Alpha Particles, Boston, Drugs,Non-Prescription/hi [History], Europe, History,20th Century, Humans, Isotopes, Portraits as Topic, Radiation, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiotherapy/hi [History], Radium, Radium/po [Poisoning], Radium/tu [Therapeutic Use], United States, Water	Soon after the discovery of radium, a school of practitioners arose who were interested primarily in the physiological rather than the tumoricidal powers of this new radioactive element. This treatment philosophy was called "mild radium therapy" and involved the oral or parenteral administration of microgram quantities of radium and its daughter isotopes, often as cures for rheumatic diseases, hypertension, and metabolic disorders. Manufacturers of patent medicines responded to this market by producing a variety of over-the-counter radioactive preparations including pills, elixirs, and salves. One such nostrum was Radithor, a popular and expensive mixture of radium 226 and radium 228 in distilled water. Radithor was advertised as an effective treatment for over 150 "endocrinologic" diseases, especially lassitude and sexual impotence. Over 400,000 bottles, each containing over 2 muCi (74 kBq) of radium, were apparently marketed and sold worldwide between 1925 and 1930. The death of the Pittsburgh millionaire sportsman Eben M. Byers, who was an avid Radithor user, by radium poisoning in 1932 brought an end to this era and prompted the development of regulatory controls for all radiopharmaceuticals

108	A patient-specific Monte Carlo dose-calculation method for photon beams	Algorithms, Biophysics, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Technology,Radiologic, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	A patient-specific, CT-based, Monte Carlo dose-calculation method for photon beams has been developed to correctly account for inhomogeneity in the patient. The method employs the EGS4 system to sample the interaction of radiation in the medium. CT images are used to describe the patient geometry and to determine the density and atomic number in each voxel. The user code (MCPAT) provides the data describing the incident beams, and performs geometry checking and energy scoring in patient CT images. Several variance reduction techniques have been implemented to improve the computation efficiency. The method was verified with measured data and other calculations, both in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media. The method was also applied to a lung treatment, where significant differences in dose distributions, especially in the low-density region, were observed when compared with the results using an equivalent pathlength method. Comparison of the DVHs showed that the Monte Carlo calculated plan predicted an underdose of nearly 20% to the target, while the maximum doses to the cord and the heart were increased by 25% and 33%, respectively. These results suggested that the Monte Carlo method may have an impact on treatment designs, and also that it can be used as a benchmark to assess the accuracy of other dose calculation algorithms. The computation time for the lung case employing five 15-MV wedged beams, with an approximate field size of 13 X 13 cm and the dose grid size of 0.375 cm, was less than 14 h on a 175-MHz computer with a standard deviation of 1.5% in the high-dose region

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system	
4554	Optimisation of a secondary standard chamber for the measurement of the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), for low photon energies	Calibration, Equipment Design, European Union, Germany, Humans, Knowledge, Linear Energy Transfer, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection/st [Standards], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Research, Whole-Body Irradiation	A secondary standard ionisation chamber for photon radiation for measuring an ionisation current, which is directly proportional to the conventionally true value of the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), was optimised. The chamber was developed in the Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf and is used successfully worldwide by dosimetry laboratories. The chamber response with respect to H*(10) for photon energies from 40 to 1,250 keV is nearly constant. For lower photon energies the response is strongly energy-dependent and does not fulfil the requirements concerning the quality of a secondary standard given in ISO 4,037-2, i.e. for energies for which the determination of the conventionally true value of H*(10) is very difficult. Considering the dose limits defined in the Directive 96/29/Euratom, in the case of whole-body irradiation the knowledge of the personal dose equivalent is of importance down to energies of approximately 12 keV. For area dosimetry, this means that the knowledge of H*(10) for energies approximately >or=12 keV is necessary. To get one secondary standard chamber for H*(10) for the whole photon energy range and to close the gap for low energies in the dissemination of the conventionally true value of H*(10), the chamber was optimised for a flat response for energies from approximately 12 to 1,250 keV	
4150	Generation and use of measurement-based 3-D dose distributions for 3-D dose calculation verification	Film Dosimetry, Humans, Michigan, Models,Anatomic, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Time, Universities	A 3-D radiation therapy treatment planning system calculates dose to an entire volume of points and therefore requires a 3-D distribution of measured dose values for quality assurance and dose calculation verification. To measure such a volumetric distribution with a scanning ion chamber is prohibitively time consuming. A method is presented for the generation of a 3-D grid of dose values based on beam's-eye-view (BEV) film dosimetry. For each field configuration of interest, a set of BEV films at different depths is obtained and digitized, and the optical densities are converted to dose. To reduce inaccuracies associated with film measurement of megavoltage photon depth doses, doses on the different planes are normalized using an ion-chamber measurement of the depth dose. A 3-D grid of dose values is created by interpolation between BEV planes along divergent beam rays. This matrix of measurement-based dose values can then be compared to calculations over the entire volume of interest. This method is demonstrated for three different field configurations. Accuracy of the film-measured dose values is determined by 1-D and 2-D comparisons with ion chamber measurements. Film and ion chamber measurements agree within 2% in the central field regions and within 2.0 mm in the penumbral regions	
2152	Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Brain Stem, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Sex Factors, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Time	PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume

1591	Modulation of radiotherapy photon beam intensity using magnetic field	Electromagnetic Fields, Electrons, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Water, X-Rays	The purpose of this study was to explore the potential advantages of using strong magnetic fields to increase tumor dose and to decrease normal tissue dose in radiation therapy. Strong magnetic fields are capable of altering the trajectories of charged particles. A magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the X-ray beam forces the secondary electrons and positrons to spiral and produces a dose peak. The same magnetic field also prevents the electrons and positrons from traveling downstream and produces a lower dose region distal to the dose peak. The locations of these high- and low-dose regions are potentially adjustable to enhance the dose to the target volume and decrease the dose to normal tissues. We studied this effect using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. The EGS4 code was used to simulate the effect produced by a coil magnet currently under construction. The coil magnet is designed to support up to 350 A operating current and 15 T peak field on windings. Dose calculations in a water phantom show that the transverse magnetic field produces significant dose effects along the beam direction of radiation therapy X-rays. Depending on the beam orientation, the radiation dose at different depths along the beam can be increased or reduced. This dose effect varies with photon energy, field size, magnetic field strength, and relative magnet/beam geometry. The off-axis beam profiles also show considerable skewness under the influence of the magnetic field. The magnetic field-induced dose shift may result in high dose regions outside the geometrical boundary of the initial radiation beam. We have demonstrated that current or near-term magnet technology is capable of producing significant dose enhancement and reduction in radiation therapy photon beams. This technology should be further developed to improve our ability to deliver higher doses to the tumor and lower doses to normal tissues in radiation therapy. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc	
1692	[Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in treatment of breast carcinoma--a new therapeutic alternative within the scope of breast-saving therapy? Current status and future prospects. Report of experiences from the European Institute of Oncology (EIO), Mailand]. [German]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Fibrosis, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Italy, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Risk, Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy, Time	BACKGROUND: External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) represents an integral component of breast-conserving treatment. In published series it has been demonstrated that the external boost can be replaced by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) where irradiation at a single dose from 10 up to 15 Gy was safely delivered directly to the tumor bed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, we initiated a dose escalation study to investigate the feasibility of applying single doses of IORT from 10 Gy up to 22 Gy. A portable IORT equipment with different electron energies was used. From July to December 1999, a total of 65 patients with T1-2 (max. 2.5 cm) No-1 breast cancer, median age 58 years (range 33-80 years) was treated. Ten patients received 10 Gy, eight patients were treated with an IORT of 15 Gy, eight received 17 Gy, six had 19 Gy, and 33 were treated with 21-22 Gy. Patients with 10 and 15 Gy received an additional EBRT of 44 and 40 Gy, respectively. In all other patients IORT was the sole radiation treatment. RESULTS: No acute side effects or intermediate untoward effects after a follow-up from three to nine months related to IORT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Since the applicator can be safely placed under the control of the surgeon and radiotherapist IORT has the potential of accurately treating the tumor bed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis. With IORT single doses of 22 Gy being equivalent to a 60 Gy EBRT can safely be delivered. Even so the average time of operation was prolonged by around 20 minutes IORT application ultimately improves the quality of life of the patients in shortening overall treatment. Long-term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate whether large single doses of IORT might have the potential of sufficient local tumor control without major side effects. As a future perspective a randomized trial comparing EBRT with IORT as sole treatment will be performed	
600	Integrating respiratory gating into a megavoltage cone-beam CT system	Artifacts, Electrons, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiography,Thoracic/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	We have previously described a low-dose megavoltage cone beam computed tomography (MV CBCT) system capable of producing projection image using one beam pulse. In this study, we report on its integration with respiratory gating for gated radiotherapy. The respiratory gating system tracks a reflective marker on the patient's abdomen midway between the xiphoid and umbilicus, and disables radiation delivery when the marker position is outside predefined thresholds. We investigate two strategies for acquiring gated scans. In the continuous rotation-gated acquisition, the linear accelerator (LINAC) is set to the fixed x-ray mode and the gantry makes a 5 min, 360 degree continuous rotation, during which the gating system turns the radiation beam on and off, resulting in projection images with an uneven distribution of projection angles (e.g., in 70 arcs each covering 2 degrees). In the gated rotation-continuous acquisition, the LINAC is set to the dynamic arc mode, which suspends the gantry rotation when the gating system inhibits the beam, leading to a slightly longer (6-7 min) scan time, but yielding projection images with more evenly distributed projection angles (e.g., approximately 0.8 degrees between two consecutive projection angles). We have tested both data acquisition schemes on stationary (a contrast detail and a thoracic) phantoms and protocol lung patients. For stationary phantoms, a separate motion phantom not visible in the images is used to trigger the RPM system. Frame rate is adjusted so that approximately 450 images (13 MU) are acquired for each scan and three-dimensional tomographic images reconstructed using a Feldkamp filtered backprojection algorithm. The gated rotation-continuous acquisition yield reconstructions free of breathing artifacts. The tumor in parenchymal lung and normal tissues are easily discernible and the boundary between the diaphragm and the lung sharply defined. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) is not degraded relative to nongated scans of stationary phantoms. The continuous rotation-gated acquisition scan also yields tomographic images with discernible anatomic features; however, streak artifacts are observed and CNR is reduced by approximately a factor of 4. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a gated MV CBCT system to verify the patient positioning for gated radiotherapy	
2709	Comparison of multileaf collimation and shield alloy blocks on an irregular target volume	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Effects, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Turkey, Water	Multileaf collimation (MLC) is a crucial component dynamic conformal radiotherapy and can be used as a replacement for conventional blocks. The most appropriate volumetric approach for the lesion's shape is achieved by MLC by conforming the prescribed dose to the critical structure or normal tissue dose. In this study, the edge effects of dose profiles on an irregular radiation field obtained by MLC and shield alloy blocks drawn by a water-phantom system were compared. We used a SL25 linac machine with MLC consisting of 40 pairs of opposing leaves and conventional alloy block shielding on a water phantom system. We found no significant edge effect difference between MLC and conventional shielding, but MLC showed clear advantages over conventional blocks in terms of time-saving, repeatability, and reliability	
2684	Basic Treatment Equivalent (BTE): a new measure of linear accelerator workload	Australia, Efficiency, Hospital Departments/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization], Time, Workload	The measurement of linear accelerator workload in radiation oncology departments is usually based on the number of fields treated per unit time. However, this approach ignores variations in treatment complexity. This prospective study, was designed to measure treatment workload directly, taking into account the variations in complexity of different treatment techniques. From this, a model was to be developed, which would be simple to apply and reproducible, both within and between radiation oncology departments in Australasia. It would provide a realistic basis for assessing treatment costs and enable the comparison of patient throughput between departments. This paper describes the derivation of the model. Over a 4-week period in the Radiation Oncology Department of Westmead Hospital, all fractions of radiotherapy were timed. The data collected included: tumour site; treatment intent; number of fields; number of wedges, compensators and shielding blocks; fraction number; patient age; performance status; and need for general anaesthesia. Multivariate modelling was performed to identify factors that significantly affected fraction duration, so that these could be used to develop a model of resource utilization. The durations of 2371 fractions were measured in 219 patients. Seventy-five per cent of fractions were given with radical intent. The factors found to influence fraction duration on multivariate modelling were: number of fields; number of shielding blocks; first treatment fraction; need for anaesthesia; and performance status. The number of wedges and compensators were also found to be significant but were not included in the model in order to maintain simplicity. This was felt to be necessary if the model is to be applied to the widest possible variety of machines. A model of resources utilization called 'Basic Treatment Equivalent' (BTE) was derived, which incorporated these factors. When tested at Westmead Hospital, this model accurately reflected the predicted BTE value over a further 1-week study period. This model of linear accelerator use, which incorporates complexity has been derived and evaluated in one radiation oncology department. This requires further prospective testing before its widespread use. The model appears to reflect linear accelerator workload better than previous measures. An Australasian study to validate the model further will be undertaken.

1787	High- and low-LET induced chromosome damage in human lymphocytes: a time-course of aberrations in metaphase and interphase	Biophysics, Bisbenzimide/pd [Pharmacology], Cell Cycle, Cells,Cultured, DNA Damage, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Enzyme Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology], Fluorescent Dyes, Gamma Rays, Humans, In Situ Hybridization,Fluorescence, Interphase, Interphase/re [Radiation Effects], Iron, Iron/me [Metabolism], Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Metaphase, Metaphase/re [Radiation Effects], Mitosis, Neon, Neon/me [Metabolism], Oxazoles, Oxazoles/pd [Pharmacology], Radiation, Research, Time, Time Factors	PURPOSE: To investigate how cell-cycle delays in human peripheral lymphocytes affect the expression of complex chromosome damage in metaphase following high- and low-LET radiation exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole blood was irradiated in vitro with a low and a high dose of 1 GeV u(-1) iron particles, 400MeV u(-1) neon particles or y-rays. Lymphocytes were cultured and metaphase cells were collected at different time points after 48-84h in culture. Interphase chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin-A, either 48 or 72 h after exposure to iron particles or gamma-rays. Cells in first division were analysed using a combination of FISH whole-chromosome painting and DAPI/ Hoechst 33258 harlequin staining. RESULTS: There was a delay in expression of chromosome damage in metaphase that was LET- and dose-dependant. This delay was mostly related to the late emergence of complex-type damage into metaphase. Yields of damage in PCC collected 48 h after irradiation with iron particles were similar to values obtained from cells undergoing mitosis after prolonged incubation. CONCLUSION: The yield of high-LET radiation-induced complex chromosome damage could be underestimated when analysing metaphase cells collected at one time point after irradiation. Chemically induced PCC is a more accurate technique since problems with complicated cell-cycle delays are avoided

N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR AMS. since 1983 using the synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. A "piercing" method with a proton beam of 12 mm in diameter (in one case 10 mm) was employed. Nine patients had unilateral anastomoses with the blood supply from branches of the internal and/or external carotid arteries, and one patient had a bilateral anastomosis. Irradiation was given in 2 fractions, in 2-3 days, the maximum total dose was 50-60 Gy. Regression of ophthalmological symptoms was noted 2-3 months after irradiation. Convalescence was noted in 8 patients, a follow-up period in 2 patients was insufficient. Of 7 patients examined by angiography complete thrombosis of the anastomosis was noted in 4, considerable reduction of the blood flow was noted in 3

Cell growth curves of each experiment were used to calculate an apparent cell survival after irradiation. Uptake measurements provided the data needed to calculate the average number of 211At decays per cell in the cell suspension. The results from each experiment were then fit to a mono-exponential function. From the exponential fit, an average of 35 +/- 2 (SD) astatine-211 decays per cell are required for 37% apparent cell survival (D0)	
1326	Comparison of the radiotoxicity of two alpha-particle-emitting immunoconjugates, terbium-149 and bismuth-213, directed against a tumor-specific, exon 9 deleted (d9) E-cadherin adhesion protein	Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Binding Sites, Bismuth, Bismuth/tu [Therapeutic Use], Breast, Cadherins/ge [Genetics], Cadherins/im [Immunology], Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Exons, Flow Cytometry, Gene Deletion, Germany, Humans, Immunoconjugates, Mutation, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radioimmunotherapy, Research, Survival, Suspensions, Terbium/tu [Therapeutic Use]	We investigated the effects of the alpha-particle emitters (149)Tb and (213)Bi coupled to a tumor-specific antibody targeting the mutated delta 9 E-cadherin (d9 E-Cad) on single cells and cell pellets. The d9 mutation of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin is found in 10% of diffuse-type gastric cancers and is not expressed in normal tissue. Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435S) transfected with d9 E-Cad or the wild-type E-cadherin gene were used to study the effects of anti-d9 E-Cad MAb coupled to (149)Tb and (213)Bi ((149)Tb-d9 MAb and (213)Bi-d9 MAb). The density of binding sites determined on transfected MDA tumor cells by Scatchard analysis and flow cytometry varied from 4 x 10(4) to 6 x 10(4) antigens per cell. Internalization of radioimmunoconjugates by cells expressing d9 E-Cad was less than 10% of bound antibody within 240 min. The effect of the radioimmunoconjugates on cell suspensions and cell pellets was quantified by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and the dose to the cell nuclei was determined using microdosimetric calculations. (149)Tb and (213)Bi immunoconjugates affected cells in suspension similarly. Significant differences in the proliferation capacity of d9 E-cadherin- and wild-type E-cadherin-expressing cells were observed at activity concentrations around 185 kBq/ml, corresponding to antibody concentrations between 200 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml. Proliferation after incubation with (213)Bi-d9 MAb was 50% greater in pelleted wild-type E-Cad-expressing cells compared to wild-type E-Cad cells in suspension. In contrast, the proliferation of pelleted d9 E-Cad cells was similar to that of d9 E-Cad cells in suspension. For (149)Tb-d9 MAb, no significant difference was found between pelleted cells and cells in suspension for low activity concentrations. However, at high activity concentrations, (149)Tb-d9 MAb had only a small effect on pelleted cells. These in vitro studies demonstrate different effects of (149)Tb and (213)Bi conjugated to a tumor-specific antibody toward single cells and tumor cell pellets. Microdosimetric simulation of single cell survival after alpha-particle irradiation modeled the experimental results with reasonable accuracy

In order to quantify and avoid these problems, a heterogeneity number H(i) as a method to quantify lateral tissue heterogeneities of single beam spot i is introduced. To evaluate this new concept, two kinds of potential errors were investigated for single beam spots: First, the dose calculation error has been obtained by comparing the dose distribution computed by a simple pencil beam algorithm to more accurate Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting error is clearly correlated with H(i). Second, the analysis of the sensitivity to setup errors of single beam spots also showed a dependence on H(i). From this data it is concluded that H(i) can be used as a criterion to assess the risks of a compromised delivered dose due to lateral tissue heterogeneities. Furthermore, a method how to incorporate this information into the inverse planning process for intensity modulated proton therapy is presented. By suppressing beam spots with a high value of H(i), the unfavorable impact of lateral tissue heterogeneities can be reduced, leading to treatment plans which are more robust to dose calculation errors of the pencil beam algorithm. Additional possibilities to use the information of H(i) are outlined in the discussion

METHODS: The radiation-induced primary DNA damage and repair were detected by the comet assay in CNE-1 and 973 cell lines. The tail moment was used as the end point, to quantitate the primary DNA damage and subsequent repair ability. The cell-survival curve was plotted by the classical colony assay, to detect the D(0) value and Dq value. The results from the above two assays were compared. RESULTS: 1. With the increment of irradiation doses, under the same experimental condition, the radiation-induced primary DNA damage was more severe in CNE-1 cells than in 973 cells (P < 0.01). From the cell-survival curves, the D(0) value was 1.631 and 1.822 in CNE-1 and CNE-1 973 cells respectively, indicating that CNE-1 cells were more sensitive to irradiation than 973 cells. The radiosensitivity detected by comet assay and by colony assay in the two cell lines tended to be consistent. 2. The half-repair time of 973 and CNE-1 cell line was 33 min and 41 min detected by comet assay, which indicats that the ability of DNA damage and repair in CNE-1 cells was weaker than in 973 cells. The Dq value of the cell survival curve was 2.152 for 973 and 0.626 for CNE-1 cell line detected by the colony assay, which indicates that the sublethal damage repair in 973 cells being much faster than in CNE-1 cells. The repair ability reflected by the results in the two cell lines was consistent. CONCLUSION: The radiosensitivities reflected by the results of the primary DNA damage and repair detected by both comet assay and colony assay in CNE-1 and 973 cells are consistent. It suggests that comet assay is a good method for detecting the radiosensitivity of tumor cells	
1399	Monte Carlo calculation of depth doses for small field of CyberKnife	Head, Humans, Japan, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation Dosage, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy	PURPOSE: A Monte Carlo (MC) model of CyberKnife was developed as a quality assurance tool. The percentage depth dose (%dd) was verified by using this model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An MC model was developed with Electron Gamma Shower version 4 (EGS4) in two steps: (1) a model of the CyberKnife treatment head and (2) a model of the collimator and phantom. The bremsstrahlung spectrum was calculated using the first model, and this spectrum was then used to calculate %dds with the second model. The calculated %dds for a large field (60 mm diameter) and three small fields (30, 15, and 5 mm diameter) were compared with those measured with a diamond detector. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The MC-calculated and measured %dd-curves for the 60 mm diameter field were in excellent agreement (<1.85%), thus confirming the validity of the model. Discrepancies between the calculated and measured %dd-curves increased with decreasing field size, with considerable discrepancy (11.62%) for the 5 mm diameter field due to lateral electron disequilibrium. Accurate dose can be determined with MC even in small fields. CONCLUSION: The MC technique can provide reliable standard data for accurate dose delivery with high-technology radiotherapies using small beams

Comparison of reactions of the body as a whole and its specific systems shortly after acute irradiation revealed the character of the relationship of RBE coefficients to LET. These data are essential for more careful estimation of radiation risk during space missions when, in parallel with chronic exposure to determinant sources, i.e. GCR and ERB, crew members may be also subjected to comparatively brief SCR attacks, particularly during solar proton events with high fluences.

Respiratory motion, however, induces artifacts in CBCT, while the respiratory correlated procedures, developed to reduce motion artifacts in axial and helical CT are not suitable for such CBCT scanners. We have developed an alternative respiratory correlated procedure for CBCT and evaluated its performance. This respiratory correlated CBCT procedure consists of retrospective sorting in projection space, yielding subsets of projections that each corresponds to a certain breathing phase. Subsequently, these subsets are reconstructed into a four-dimensional (4D) CBCT dataset. The breathing signal, required for respiratory correlation, was directly extracted from the 2D projection data, removing the need for an additional respiratory monitor system. Due to the reduced number of projections per phase, the contrast-to-noise ratio in a 4D scan reduced by a factor 2.6-3.7 compared to a 3D scan based on all projections. Projection data of a spherical phantom moving with a 3 and 5 s period with and without simulated breathing irregularities were acquired and reconstructed into 3D and 4D CBCT datasets. The positional deviations of the phantoms center of gravity between 4D CBCT and fluoroscopy were small: 0.13 +/- 0.09 mm for the regular motion and 0.39 +/- 0.24 mm for the irregular motion. Motion artifacts, clearly present in the 3D CBCT datasets, were substantially reduced in the 4D datasets, even in the presence of breathing irregularities, such that the shape of the moving structures could be identified more accurately. Moreover, the 4D CBCT dataset provided information on the 3D trajectory of the moving structures, absent in the 3D data. Considerable breathing irregularities, however, substantially reduces the image quality. Data presented for three different lung cancer patients were in line with the results obtained from the phantom study. In conclusion, we have successfully implemented a respiratory correlated CBCT procedure yielding a 4D dataset. With respiratory correlated CBCT on a linear accelerator, the mean position, trajectory, and shape of a moving tumor can be verified just prior to treatment. Such verification reduces respiration induced geometrical uncertainties, enabling safe delivery of 4D radiotherapy such as gated radiotherapy with small margins

All the patients were in complete remission at the time of irradiation. Shielding of the kidneys was effected at the start of treatment and the right lobe of the liver was shielded after a dose of 20 Gy was delivered. As of January 1982, 17 of the patients were alive and free of disease with a follow-up ranging from 6 to 32 months (mean follow-up of 18.5 months). Two patients were dead from their disease. Alterations in liver chemistry were observed in 5 patients, clinical jaundice or transient hepatomegaly along with changes in liver chemistry in 4 patients, classical veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients and 7 of the patients did not develop any complication. No death from complications were observed.

We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor; perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact. All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Another patient had progressive enhancement and low relative cerebral blood volume and flow; biopsy showed necrosis and inflammation. One patient had progressive enhancement and high choline levels (proved anaplastic astrocytoma). In another, T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis); enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up). CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor	
213	Experimental investigation of the response of an amorphous silicon EPID to intensity modulated radiotherapy beams	Calibration, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electronics, Equipment Design, Humans, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Scattering,Radiation, Silicon/ch [Chemistry], Software, Water	The aim of this work was to experimentally determine the difference in response of an amorphous silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging device (EPID) to the open and multileaf collimator (MLC) transmitted beam components of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) beams. EPID dose response curves were measured for open and MLC transmitted (MLCtr) 10 x 10 cm2 beams at central axis and with off axis distance using a shifting field technique. The EPID signal was obtained by replacing the flood-field correction with a pixel sensitivity variation matrix correction. This signal, which includes energy-dependent response, was then compared to ion-chamber measurements. An EPID calibration method to remove the effect of beam energy variations on EPID response was developed for IMRT beams. This method uses the component of open and MLCtr fluence to an EPID pixel calculated from the MLC delivery file and applies separate radially dependent calibration factors for each component. The calibration procedure does not correct for scatter differences between ion chamber in water measurements and EPID response; these must be accounted for separately with a kernel-based approach or similar method. The EPID response at central axis for the open beam was found to be 1.28 +/- 0.03 of the response for the MLCtr beam, with the ratio increasing to 1.39 at 12.5 cm off axis. The EPID response to MLCtr radiation did not change with off-axis distance. Filtering the beam with copper plates to reduce the beam energy difference between open and MLCtr beams was investigated; however, these were not effective at reducing EPID response differences. The change in EPID response for uniform sliding window IMRT beams with MLCtr dose components from 0.3% to 69% was predicted to within 2.3% using the separate EPID response calibration factors for each dose component. A clinical IMRT image calibrated with this method differed by nearly 30% in high MLCtr regions from an image calibrated with an open beam calibration factor only. Accounting for the difference in EPID response to open and MLCtr radiation should improve IMRT dosimetry with a-Si EPIDs

There was no AR after prior exposure of the cells in S phase to secondary irradiation from 70 GeV protons. The AR was not observed after preliminary X-irradiation of the lymphocytes in G0 and G1 and 'challenge' irradiation in G1. Cells from 6 patients with Down's syndrome were tested. At least 5 of them did not show the AR. The AR is considered to be a phenomenon of the antimutagenic aftereffect

It is shown that using this equation provides dose estimates on the central axis in a clinical electron beam that are accurate to within 1% of dose maximum for all 24 clinical beams investigated except very close to the surface in swept beams. In contrast, the error in the dose as a percentage of the local dose is much higher for values of the depth/R50 greater than 1.2

2044	The phase I/II clinical study of carbon ion therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix	Adenocarcinoma, Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Heavy Ions/ae [Adverse Effects], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Pelvis, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The phase I/II clinical study of carbon beam therapy was undertaken for 31 cases of advanced cervical cancer of stages IIIB and IVA from June 1995 to November 1997. The main purpose was to determine clinically useful fraction doses without severe acute reaction of normal tissues and to assess tumor control dose levels achievable without significant normal tissue toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment was given with four fixed fractions per week (24 fractions over 6 weeks) and was initiated with a fraction dose of 2.2 Gray equivalent (GyE), and the dose was increased as 2.4 GyE, 2.6 GyE, 2.8 GyE, and 3.0 GyE. Consequently, the total dose initiated was 52.8 GyE, to increase up to 72.0 GyE in 4.8-GyE increments in the dose-escalation fashion. Thirty patients with eligible advanced cervical cancers consisting of 27 squamous cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas were analyzed. RESULTS: Acute response of normal tissues was less than with photon treatment until fraction doses of 2.8 GyE were administered, and patients finished treatment with comfortable conditions. Severe late complications occurred in the two patients who received more than 67.2 GyE. The 2-year cumulative survival rate and the local control rate of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were 61.5% and 59.3%, respectively. According to stages, the 2-year survival rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 54.4% and 75.0%, respectively. The 2-year local control rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 52.6% and 75.0%, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results indicated that the disease control seems to be relatively better for very advanced disease and with dose escalation treatment. Local control was not significantly correlated with total dose and tumor volume. The results of the present study, despite small numbers and short observation, suggest that an adequate fraction dose for pelvis fields is 2.8 to 3.0 GyE and that the carbon beam therapy might be advantageous for advanced cervical cancer	
106	A light localizer for use at large distances from a radiation source	Biophysics, Cyclotrons/is [Instrumentation], Equipment Design, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Fiber Optics/is [Instrumentation], Humans, Light, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Optics/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic	In the superconducting cyclotron used for neutron therapy at Harper Hospital, space limitations prevented the use of a simple conventional light localizing system, employing a single mirror and a light source. The superconducting magnet coil is close to the neutron producing target and the vacuum window separating the acceleration chamber from atmospheric pressure is situated approximately 56 cm from this target. Therefore, the light localizing system must be designed to incorporate lenses, mirrors, an optical fiber light pipe and adjustment motors, in order to make the system compact enough to fit in the available space and to allow easy access for adjustment and alignment. The design of the light localizing system is explained in detail

Most cases occur in cirrhotic livers. Management decisions should not be based on the stage of the tumour extension but rather on the functional situation of the liver. The first therapeutic option which should be considered is surgical resection if the case presents with a single tumour (or less than 4 tumours for some teams) without detectable metastasis nor intraportal thrombosis and if the liver remaining after surgery will be sufficient for normal hepatic functions. The disadvantage of resection is the high risk of recurrence in the long term. Liver transplantation cannot be proposed if the hepatocellular carcinoma has produced clinical signs but it can be a possibility in case of a resectable tumour in the framework of a prospective protocol comparing transplantation and resection. Intra-arterial injection of 131-iodine linked lipiodol is the only effective treatment in case of portal thrombosis. Chemoembolization of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma has led to spectacular tumour response but its effect on survival has not been demonstrated by randomized studies. For tumours less than 3 cm in diameter, even multifocal alcoholization has proved encouraging results. Although a randomized study of questionable quality suggested tamoxifen could be effective, there is no current indication for this drug. External radiotherapy may be a possibility in the future, especially with proton irradiation. Thus the current management of hepatocellular carcinoma is in a difficult, even paradoxical, situation since there is a wide therapeutic choice (resection, alcoholization, transplantation) for the rare cases with small tumours but almost no possibilities for the more severe cases most frequently encountered.

1982	Compatibility of Varian 2100C gated operations with enhanced dynamic wedge and IMRT dose delivery	California, Film Dosimetry, Humans, Jaw, Models,Theoretical, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Software, Time Factors	An enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) is one of the latest technical innovations frequently used in the radiotherapy department. Its usage is enthusiastically supported by radiation therapists. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the other, which has become popular within the past several years. Its usage is not as straightforward as the EDW. However, its ability to further increase dose conformity to the target and to spare the surrounding normal tissues has been evidenced. Both of these treatment modalities demand sophisticated software, which controls precision motion and speed of jaws or multileaf collimators as well as dose rate. This paper deals with the question of how accurately the EDW profiles and IMRT dose distributions be maintained when the additional constraint of linear accelerator gating is invoked. For this, square pulses mimicking breathing were used in gated and nongated modes for film dosimetry and ion chamber measurements using the Varian 2100C linear accelerator. The results show no observable difference between gated and nongated EDW profiles and IMRT dose distribution regardless of the machine repetition rate. Also studied in this paper are the "fuzzy" dose distributions caused by realistic finite gate window settings	
3468	Characteristics of the high-energy photon beam of a 25-MeV accelerator	California, Californium, Electrons, Humans, Lead, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Steel, Tungsten, Universities	The CGR Saturne 25 is an isocentrically mounted standing wave medical linear accelerator that produces dual-energy photon beams and a scanned electron beam with six selectable energies between 4 and 25 MeV. The highest energy photon beam is nominally referred to as 23 MV. For this beam the mean energy of the accelerated electron beam on the 1.3 radiation length (4 mm) tungsten x-ray target is found to be approximately 21 MeV, with the energy acceptance stated to be +/- 5%. The electron beam traverses a 270 degrees bending magnet upstream of the x-ray production target. The resulting bremsstrahlung beam passes through a combination steel and lead flattening filter, 4-cm maximum thickness. Dosimetric data for the 23-MV beam are presented with respect to rectangular field output factor, depth of maximum dose as a function of field size, surface and buildup dose, central axis percent depth dose, tissue-phantom ratios, beam profile, applicability of inverse square, and block transmission. Some data are also presented on the effect of different flattening filter designs on apparent beam energy

The characteristic organophosphate metabolites of suspected uveal melanomas before proton beam irradiation were determined qualitatively by phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo using a three-turn surface coil. Spectra of choroidal hemangioma, osteoma, and metastasis were also obtained in vivo and compared with those of uveal melanomas. Analysis of spectra performed at 1.5 T showed significant peaks of phosphomonoesters, inorganic phosphate, phosphodiesters, phosphocreatine, and adenosine 5'-triphosphates. The unusually high concentration of phosphodiesters may be considered as a marker for uveal melanomas and other choroidal tumors. By analyzing the ratio of phosphocreatine to phosphodiesters spectral area values, we interpreted qualitatively spectra of intraocular tumors to differentiate malignant tumors from benign lesions. Nevertheless, the main limitation of interpreting the spectra was their contamination by signals from surrounding tissues	
858	The fast neutron component in treatment irradiations with 12C beam	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Water	Using 12C beams of 200 AMeV kinetic energy the production of secondary fragments from nuclear reactions in a thick water absorber (12.78 cm) was investigated. Fast neutrons and energetic charged particles (p-, d-, t-, a-particles) emitted in the forward hemisphere were identified by a BaF2/plastic-scintillation detector telescope. Neutron energy spectra were recorded at various angles using time-of-flight techniques. The neutron emission is forward peaked and the energy spectrum shows a broad maximum about half the energy per nucleon of the primary 12C ions. The total yield of fast neutrons emitted into the forward hemisphere integrated over the energy range of 25 to 500 MeV was found to be 0.43 +/- 0.1 per primary ion. The dose contribution of fast neutrons in patient treatments with carbon ions is estimated to be less than 1% of the total treatment dose	
4522	Scattered photons from wedges in high-energy x-ray beams	Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Universities	The presence of a wedge increases the fraction of "head-scattered" photons in a high-energy x-ray beam. We have compared internal and external wedges for x-ray beam energies between 6 and 25 MV by determining their SPRw, i.e., the ratio of the dose contribution from photons scattered by the wedge and photons either coming directly from the target or scattered by other structures, including the flattening filter. Marked differences were observed. First, SPRw for the thickest external wedge (60 degrees) was 1.8% at a field size of 10 x 10 cm2 and mildly dependent on the photon energy, while SPRw for internal wedges for this field size varied between 4.4% and 5.4% depending mostly on the location and size of the wedge and marginally on the photon energy. Second, the variation of SPRw with the collimator setting c x c was different for the internal and external wedges. SPRw for the internal wedge approached a limiting value at large c and could be fitted with an error function, while SPRw for the external wedge increased quadratically with c. As a result, the difference in SPRw (c) for internal and external wedges is reduced for large fields	
4483	Dose optimization of proton and heavy ion therapy using generalized sampled pattern matching	Humans, Japan, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Water	We have proposed a new dose optimization method for proton and heavy ion therapy using generalized sampled pattern matching, where an optimal beam weight distribution for scanning is obtained as a solution. Using water phantom models, one-dimensional lateral and depth dose distributions were separately optimized, each resulting in a uniform dose distribution within a target region and minimum dose fall-off to minimize undesired irradiation onto neighbouring tissues. Subsequently, we have applied the technique to broad beam three-dimensional proton therapy, leading to a homogeneous dose distribution inside a target and minimized distal and lateral dose fall-off for most convex tumour shapes

Twenty-three eyes have been enucleated because of complications and five eyes have been obtained at autopsy. We have evaluated 27 of these eyes. Neovascular glaucoma (10 eyes), painful keratitis (6 eyes), continued tumor growth (4 eyes), and vitreous hemorrhage (2 eyes) were the major complications of treatment that led to enucleation. The degree of tumor necrosis correlated with the size, pigmentation, and anterior extent of the tumor. It did not correlate with the interval from irradiation or with the amount of tumor shrinkage. Mitotic figures were extremely rare in treated tumors, suggesting that the tumor cells have lost their ability to cycle

To this end, lung fibroblast IMR-90 cultures were exposed either to external beam gamma-radiation or to internal irradiation from decay of (125)I-labeled deoxyuridine ((125)IUdR) incorporated into the cellular DNA. A relatively small dose of 1 Gy of gamma-radiation was delivered to cell cultures either at a high dose-rate (HDR, 1 Gy, 1 min) or at a low dose-rate (LDR, 1 Gy, 22 h). More than 41,000 transcripts were assayed by oligo DNA microarray featuring all known and predicted genes in human genome. Gene expression profiles following gamma-radiation and decays of high-linear energy transfer (LET)-like (125)I share the majority of genes in common, indicating the involvement of similar pathways in signal transduction after IR exposures of different modalities. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism of nt, protein kinase cascade and cell cycle are among the up-regulated biological processes mostly affected by gamma-radiation in IMR-90 cells. The translational elongation, negative regulation of cell growth, antigen processing and protein targeting are down-regulated following IR exposures. About one-third of genes differentially expressed following either HDR or LDR gamma-radiation exposures in the same absorbed dose were different, indicating the involvement of distinct transcriptional programs in cellular response to irradiation delivered with the different dose rates

These include the potential neutron dose to the patient, the special shielding requirements and the neutron activation of the accelerator and its surroundings. The results of the structural protection survey are described. In particular, the methods recommended by the NCRP for predicting the neutron dose equivalent at the end of a maze are shown to be reliable. Dose rates due to activation of the treatment room and various parts of the accelerator were measured, and potential doses to staff were assessed. Neutron dose equivalents were measured in the specified two metre diameter patient plane using the standard NRPB neutron badges and also with the recently developed CR-39 dosimeters. The latter appear to give sensible results

In this work, a prostate carcinoma spheroid model was used to evaluate the feasibility of targeting micrometastatic clusters of tumor cells using 213Bi-labeled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody, J591. In prostate cancer, vascular dissemination of tumor cells or tumor cell clusters to the marrow constitutes an important step in the progression of this disease to widespread skeletal involvement, an incurable state. Such prevascularized clusters are ideal targets for radiolabeled antibodies because the barriers to antibody penetration that are associated with the capillary basal lamina have not yet formed. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides such as 131I, which are widely used in radioimmunotherapy, are not expected to be effective when targeting single cells or small cell clusters. This is because the range of the emissions is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the target size, and the energy deposited per traversal is insufficient to produce any significant radiobiological effect. Spheroids of the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP-LN3, were used as a model of prevascularized micrometastases; their response to an anti-PSMA antibody, J591, radiolabeled with the alpha-particle emitter 213Bi (T(1/2), 45.6 min.) has been measured. The time course of spheroid volume reductions was found to be sensitive to the initial spheroid volume. J591 labeled with 0.9 MBq/ml 213Bi resulted in a 3-log reduction in spheroid volume on day 33, relative to control, for spheroids with an initial diameter of 130 microm; 1.8 MBq/ml were required to achieve a similar response for spheroids with an initial diameter of 180 microm. Equivalent spheroid responses were observed after 12 Gy of acute external beam photon irradiation. Monte Carlo-based microdosimetric analyses of the 213Bi decay distribution in individual spheroids of 130-microm diameter yielded an average alpha-particle dose of 3.7 Gy to the spheroids, resulting in a relative biological effectiveness factor of 3.2 over photon irradiation. The activity concentrations used in the experiments were clinically relevant, and this work supports the possibility of using 213Bi-labeled antibodies not only for disseminated single tumor cells, as found in patients with leukemia, but also for micrometastatic tumor deposits up to 180 microm in diameter (1200 cells)

[Italian]	Electrons, Great Britain, Humans, London, Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Physics, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	The features of the electron beam that make it a unique therapeutic tool, are related to physical characteristic rather than to any special biological effectiveness. The advantages of the dose distribution pattern are greatest at low energies (under 20 MeV), suggesting the use of electrons for irradiation of superficial tumors with the sparing of underlying tissues. Modern clinical electron practice demands electron treatment beams offering a high degree of purity, uniformity and the steepest possible fall-off of dose beyond the treatment volume. There are approximately 135 Linacs installed in UK, and approximately half of them have electron capacity with range of energy between 4 and 15/20 MeV. Compared to photon beams, 10% of treatment load is for electrons with a maximum of 15% in very specialised centres

Immunohistochemical overexpression of cyclin D1 was determined in paraffin-embedded specimens from diagnostic biopsies of 89 primary cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), using a polyclonal antiserum. The tumor response rates were estimated after curative treatment (i.e. surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Patients whose tumors were overexpressing cyclin D1 showed complete or partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-FU. In addition, a majority of cyclin D1 negative tumors did not respond at all to this treatment (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). This study indicates that immunohistochemical assessment of cyclin D1 expression in SCCHN could be a new predictive marker to select a subgroup of patients that will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy

Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues	
2598	Linear accelerator radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: current status	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cerebral Angiography, Child, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Complications, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Risk, Time	228 patients affected by cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 100 months (mean 42 months). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 47% of treated patients at one year and 80% at 2 years. 17 haemorrhages were observed after treatment and 6 patients died from them. No bleeding took place after complete angiographic obliteration. 11 patients suffered for radionecrosis. In 6 patients complete recovery was obtained with corticoid medication. The aim of this study is to present our results and to evaluate the effect of irradiation on the risk of bleeding after radiosurgery. Patients were considered at risk in the time lapse after irradiation and before angiographic obliteration or other definitive treatment or death. Patients were followed from the date of radiosurgery and the number of haemorrhages were recorded every six months. In our series the bleeding risk in patients harbouring incompletely obliterated AVMs decreases from 8% in the first year after radiosurgery to 0% starting from the 24th month of the follow-up

Proton radiation therapy has potential to reduce the risk of adverse events compared with conventional radiation, but it is associated with a higher treatment cost. The objective of the current study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of proton therapy compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma. METHODS: The consequences of radiation therapy were evaluated using a Markov simulation model. Children age 5 years with medulloblastoma were followed. The patients were at risk of several types of adverse events, including hearing loss, intelligence quotient (IQ) loss, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), osteoporosis, cardiac disease, and secondary malignancies. The patients also were at risk of death and were divided into risk groups for normal death, death due to tumor recurrence, treatment-related cardiac death, treatment-related subsequent tumor death, or treatment-related other death. A review of the literature was conducted to estimate the parameters in the model. RESULTS: The base-case results showed that proton therapy was associated with 23,600 in cost savings and 0.68 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The analyses showed that reductions in IQ loss and GHD contributed to the greatest part of the cost savings and were the most important parameters for cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated that proton radiation therapy can be cost-effective and cost-saving compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of children with medulloblastoma if the appropriate patients are selected for the therapy. However, there have been few long-term follow-up studies, and more much information on the long-term consequences of radiation therapy is needed. Copyright (c) 2005 American Cancer Society

In the former case, aneurysm and large AVM in the left visual tuber were causes of 4 hemorrhages. In the latter, AVM of subcortical nodes and internal capsule were responsible for single hemorrhage. The patients underwent intraoperative embolization of the anterior ciliary artery followed by its clipping. This allowed the authors to exclude aneurysm and to achieve obliteration of the bulk of AVM. Operation were performed under intraoperative guidance of motor and speech functions. Residual AVM were exposed to proton beam radiation. The outcomes of treatment were good. After 4 months of surgery, the male had no neurological disorders; in the female motor and speech disorders were associated with prior hemorrhage. [References: 10]

1668	The efficiency and tolerance of half-body irradiation (HBI) in patients with multiple metastases. The Krakow experience	Adult, Aged, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Bone Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Breast Neoplasms, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Metastasis/pp [Physiopathology], Neoplasm Metastasis/rt [Radiotherapy], Pain, Pain/et [Etiology], Pain/pc [Prevention & Control], Palliative Care, Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Poland, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy Dosage, Survival, Time Factors	AIM: To present our experience regarding the efficiency and tolerance of half-body irradiation in patients with multiple cancer metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 1997, 102 patients with multiple cancer metastases received half-body irradiation (HBI) at the Center of Oncology--Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute in Krakow. Most of the patients (93/102) had bone metastases (Table 1). The HBI was performed with 9 MV photon beam from linear accelerator. In 88 patients only one region (upper, mid or lower) was treated, and 14 patients received upper and lower HBI (13 patients), or upper and mid HBI (one patient) (Table 2). The mean doses were: 6 Gy in upper HBI, 8 Gy in mid HBI, and 9 Gy in lower HBI (Table 3). RESULTS: The positive palliative effect (complete or partial pain relief) was observed in 77 (75.5%) patients (Table 4). Complete pain relief was higher in patients with prostate cancer, and in patients who received mid or lower HBI. During follow-up 47 (46.1%) patients developed pain progression after treatment (Table 5). The probability of survival without pain progression was higher in patients who developed complete pain relief (86.7% at 6 months, 69.3% at 12 and 24 months) than in patients with partial response (52.9% at 6 months, 32.8% at 12 months, and 5.5% at 24 months) (Figure 1). In most of the patients (74/102, 72.5%) the tolerance was good. CONCLUSIONS: HBI is an efficient method for palliation in patients with multiple painful metastases	
609	Number of patients potentially eligible for proton therapy	Brachytherapy, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology/td [Trends], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Sweden, Treatment Outcome	A group of Swedish radiation oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy in a facility where one of the principal aims is to facilitate randomized and other studies in which the advantage of protons can be shown and the magnitude of the differences compared with optimally administered conventional radiation treatment, also including intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and brachytherapy, can be shown. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence in Sweden, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours together with information on normal tissue complication rates. In Sweden, it is assessed that between 2200 and 2500 patients annually are eligible for proton beam therapy, and that for these patients the potential therapeutic benefit is so great as to justify the additional expense of proton therapy. This constitutes between 14-15% of all irradiated patients annually	
1776	A higher micronucleus yield in B-versus T-cells after low-dose gamma-irradiation is not linked with defective Ku86 protein	Adult, Anatomy, Antigens,Nuclear, B-Lymphocytes/me [Metabolism], B-Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], B-Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Extracts, Cell Nucleus/pa [Pathology], Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Separation, Cells,Cultured, Chromosome Breakage, DNA Helicases, DNA Repair/re [Radiation Effects], DNA-Binding Proteins, DNA-Binding Proteins/me [Metabolism], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Gamma Rays, Humans, Immunomagnetic Separation, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/cy [Cytology], Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Micronucleus Tests, Middle Aged, Neutrons, Nuclear Proteins, Nuclear Proteins/me [Metabolism], Physics, Radiation, Research, T-Lymphocytes/me [Metabolism], T-Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], T-Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Universities	PURPOSE: To elaborate the B-cell micronucleus (MN) response in the low-dose region in detail and to investigate the postulated deficiency in DNA-PK in B-cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphocytes of five healthy volunteers were irradiated with low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons with doses ranging between 0.01 and 2 Gy. After post-irradiation incubation, B- and T-cells were isolated via CD3 and CD19 immunomagnetic microbeads. MN were analysed in both subpopulations. To study the underlying mechanism of chromosomal radiosensitivity, cell extracts prepared from purified B- and T-cells were subjected to SDS-electrophoresis and electroblotting using antibodies directed against the DNA-PK repair enzymes Ku70/86 and DNA-PKcs. Activity measurements were performed using the SignaTECT DNA-dependent protein kinase assay. DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and rejoining was determined using constant-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: For low LET gamma-rays a higher MN yield was observed in B-cells than in T-cells, but only in those samples exposed to doses < 1 Gy. For 1 Gy, the MN yields were comparable and for 2Gy even lower in B-cells compared with T-cells. After high LET neutron irradiation no significant differences in MN yields were observed between both subsets. The results of the DNA-PK experiments demonstrate that there is no difference between T- and B-cells in the basal expression and activity of DNA-PK repair proteins. No differences in DNA DSB induction and rejoining were found between T- and B-cells using constant-field gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: From the results, it was concluded that the enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity in B-cells is restricted to low doses (<1 Gy) of low LET radiation and that the chromosomal behaviour of B-cells to low LET radiation cannot be attributed to aberrant forms of the DNA-PK components. A type of chromosomal induced radioresistance (IRR) may be a possible explanation for the observed effect

Management remains controversial, but if there is progression, chemotherapy is preferred for young patients. Stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy and proton beam radiotherapy allow smaller, more precise doses of radiation to be administered and can be considered in older children with progressive disease. A mouse model of NF-1 with optic pathway gliomas has the potential to provide important insights into the development of gliomas as well as serving as a model for their effective treatment.

To take advantage of this effect, techniques have been developed that combine existing hyperthermia devices with a linear accelerator. This allows concomitant delivery of either ultrasound or microwave hyperthermia with photon radiation therapy. Two techniques have been used clinically: the orthogonal technique, in which the microwave or ultrasound beam and the radiation beam are orthogonal to one another, and the en face technique, in which the ultrasound or microwave beam and the radiation beam travel into the tumour through the same treatment window. The en face technique has necessitated the development of special attachments so that the hyperthermia device can be mounted to the linear accelerator and so that non-uniform portions of the hyperthermia device can be removed from the radiation beam. For microwave therapy, applicators are mounted onto the linear accelerator using the compensating filter tray holder. For ultrasound, special reflector devices are mounted to a frame that is mounted onto the compensating filter tray holder of the linear accelerator. Because the linear accelerator is an isocentric device, the height of the radiation source is fixed, and this has necessitated specially designed devices so that the ultrasound support system is compatible with the linear accelerator. The treatment setups for both the en face technique and the orthogonal technique require the interaction of both hyperthermia and radiation therapy personnel and equipment. The dosimetry and day-to-day operations for each technique are unique. The simulation for the en face technique is much different from the simulation of a normal radiation treatment and requires the presence of a hyperthermia physicist. Also, for the en face technique, the attenuation of the microwave applicator and the thickness and attenuation of the ultrasound reflector system are taken into account for radiation dosimetry. This paper presents details of the dosimetry and logistics of the techniques for simultaneous thermoradiotherapy based on 7 years of experience treating more than 50 patients	
132	Treatment of brain tumors in children is associated with abnormal MR spectroscopic ratios in brain tissue remote from the tumor site.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Humans, Lactic Acid/me [Metabolism], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Radiotherapy, Research	PURPOSE: Children who have brain tumors are at risk for a variety of treatment-related sequelae, including neuropsychological and cognitive impairment, neurologic deficits, and neuroendocrinologic disturbances. We sought to determine the value of proton MR spectroscopy in assessing brain tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child's treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: In children with brain tumors, MR spectroscopy of brain tissue remote from the tumor reveals treatment-related biochemical changes	
2006	Evaluation of polymer gels and MRI as a 3-D dosimeter for intensity-modulated radiation therapy	Biophysics, Calibration, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Film Dosimetry, Gels, Germany, Glass, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Polymers, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Time	BANG gel (MGS Research, Inc., Guilford, CT) has been evaluated for measuring intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose distributions. Treatment plans with target doses of 1500 cGy were generated by the Peacock IMRT system (NOMOS Corp., Sewickley, PA) using test target volumes. The gels were enclosed in 13 cm outer diameter cylindrical glass vessels. Dose calibration was conducted using seven smaller (4 cm diameter) cylindrical glass vessels irradiated to 0-1800 cGy in 300 cGy increments. Three-dimensional maps of the proton relaxation rate R2 were obtained using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) and correlated with dose. A Hahn spin echo sequence was used with TR = 3 s, TE = 20 and 100 ms, NEX = 1, using 1 x 1 x 3 mm3 voxels. The MRI measurements were repeated weekly to identify the gel-aging characteristics. Ionization chamber, thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD), and film dosimetry measurements of the IMRT dose distributions were obtained to compare against the gel results. The other dosimeters were used in a phantom with the same external cross-section as the gel phantom. The irradiated R2 values of the large vessels did not precisely track the smaller vessels, so the ionization chamber measurements were used to normalize the gel dose distributions. The point-to-point standard deviation of the gel dose measurements was 7.0 cGy. When compared with the ionization chamber measurements averaged over the chamber volume, 1% agreement was obtained. Comparisons against radiographic film dose distribution measurements and the treatment planning dose distribution calculation were used to determine the spatial localization accuracy of the gel and MRI. Spatial localization was better than 2 mm, and the dose was accurately determined by the gel both within and outside the target. The TLD chips were placed throughout the phantom to determine gel measurement precision in high- and low-dose regions. A multidimensional dose comparison tool that simultaneously examines the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement was used to evaluate the gel in both low-and high-dose gradient regions. When 3% and 3 mm criteria were used for the comparisons, more than 90% of the TLD measurements agreed with the gel, with the worst of 309 TLD chip measurements disagreeing by 40% of the criteria. All four MRI measurement session gel-measured dose distributions were compared to evaluate the time behavior of the gel. The low-dose regions were evaluated by comparison with TLD measurements at selected points, while high-dose regions were evaluated by directly comparing measured dose distributions. Tests using the multidimensional comparison tool showed detectable degradation beyond one week postirradiation, but all low-dose measurements passed relative to the test criteria and the dose distributions showed few regions that failed

The neutrons are produced by bombarding beryllium targets with protons and deuterons from our K = 32 negative ion cyclotron. The dose rate in air 1 m distance from the thick target within a 13 x 13 cm2 field amounts to about 50 cGy/min at 30 microA of 32 MeV protons

Treatment relies on a fixation system that permits a precise use of the coordinates estimated at stereotactic angiography or stereotactic computed tomography. The field of treatment can be exactly outlined in the CT images during repeat examinations, thus facilitating the recognition of changes induced by radiation. The system also allows the extent of the arteriovenous malformation, as seen at angiography, to be accurately traced in the CT sections thus enabling evaluation of possible radiation damage to surrounding brain structures. The precision of the method as well as its hypothetical merits and disadvantages are discussed. The number of patients treated is still small and the follow-up time is too short in the majority of cases to allow definite conclusions. Examples of preliminary results are given

This can be useful during commissioning of electron beams from a linac and in clinical practice where irregular fields are also encountered. The Monte Carlo code BEAM/EGS4 was used to model electron beams (6-20 MeV) from a Varian 2100C linear accelerator. After optimization of the Monte Carlo simulation model, agreement within 1% to 2% was obtained between calculated and measured (with a Si diode) lateral and depth dose distributions or within 1 mm in the penumbral regions. Output factors for square, rectangular, and circular fields were measured using two different plane-parallel ion chambers (Markus and NACP) and compared to MC simulations. The agreement was usually within 1% to 2%. This study was not primarily concerned with minimizing the simulation time required to obtain output factors but some considerations with respect to this are presented. It would be particularly useful if the MC model could also be used to calculate output factors for other, similar linacs. To see if this was possible, the primary electron energies in the MC model were retuned to model a recently commissioned similar linac. Good agreement between calculated and measured output factors was obtained for most field sizes for this second accelerator

A flexible software environment is being created that allows planning radiation treatment for these new modalities and combining different forms of radiation treatment with consideration of biological effects. The system uses common input interfaces, medical image sets for definition of patient geometry and dose reporting protocols. Previously, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Montana State University (MSU) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) had accrued experience in the development and application of Monte Carlo based, three-dimensional, computational dosimetry and treatment planning tools for radiotherapy in several specialized areas. In particular, INEEL and MSU have developed computational dosimetry systems for neutron radiotherapy and neutron capture therapy, while LLNL has developed the PEREGRINE computational system for external beam photon-electron therapy. Building on that experience, the INEEL and MSU are developing the MINERVA (modality inclusive environment for radiotherapeutic variable analysis) software system as a general framework for computational dosimetry and treatment planning for a variety of emerging forms of radiotherapy. In collaboration with this development, LLNL has extended its PEREGRINE code to accommodate internal sources for molecular targeted radiotherapy (MTR), and has interfaced it with the plugin architecture of MINERVA. Results from the extended PEREGRINE code have been compared to published data from other codes, and found to be in general agreement (EGS4-2%, MCNP-10%) (Descalle et al 2003 Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 18 71-9). The code is currently being benchmarked against experimental data. The interpatient variability of the drug pharmacokinetics in MTR can only be properly accounted for by image-based, patient-specific treatment planning, as has been common in external beam radiation therapy for many years. MINERVA offers 3D Monte Carlo-based MTR treatment planning as its first integrated operational capability. The new MINERVA system will ultimately incorporate capabilities for a comprehensive list of radiation therapies. In progress are modules for external beam photon-electron therapy and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Brachytherapy and proton therapy are planned. Through the open application programming interface (API), other groups can add their own modules and share them with the community

These include: 130 patients treated for definitive radiation therapy of choroidal melanoma; 17 patients treated for tumors of the base of skull, cervical spine and cranium, which abut structures of the central nervous system (CNS); 23 patients treated for sarcomas of soft tissue and bone; 65 patients treated for carcinoma of the prostate; 14 patients treated for carcinoma of the rectum and anus; and 23 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the oral cavity and oro-pharynx. Data on causes of failure and morbidity of treatment are presented. Overall the results are judged to be extremely encouraging. In particular, the treatment of the choroidal melanomas and sarcomas abutting CNS structures have clear clinical value, and the treatment of prostatic tumors and tumors of the head and neck are thought to be promising	
3011	Radiation dose heterogeneity in receptor and antigen mediated boron neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Computer Simulation, Helium, Humans, Ions, Isotopes, Lithium, Methods, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Nitrogen, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Software, Sweden, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities	Boron neutron capture therapy, BNCT, might be a valuable tumour therapeutical modality for the treatment of cells that are difficult to handle with conventional methods such as surgery or external radiotherapy. The principle is that tumour associated 10B atoms capture thermal neutrons and thereby forms high-LET helium and lithium ions as reaction products. An interesting development is to conjugate 10B atoms to macromolecules that bind to tumour cells with over-expressed receptors or specific antigens. The targeting macromolecules might be receptor-ligands, antibodies or antibody-fragments containing 10B. The present study deals with the limitations of such an approach. One problem is the background dose from capture of neutrons in physiologically occurring elements, especially nitrogen. We showed, with computer simulations, that the background specific energy (the stochastic analogy of dose) in the cell nuclei, due to captures in nitrogen, had a wide spread and could be rather high, up to 3 Gy in some cells, when relevant neutron fluencies were applied. The maximal amount of 10B that can be delivered to single tumour cells due to receptor-ligand, receptor-antibody or antigen-antibody mediated binding is probably in the range 10(8)-10(10) atoms/cell. Our calculations showed that the tumour cells had to contain about 10(9) 10B/cell to give a therapeutically interesting dose to the nuclei of the targeted cells. The doses were highest when the boron was in the cell nucleus. There was also a wide spread of specific energy absorbed by the nuclei after neutron capture in 10B. When, for example, 10(8) 10(10)B/nucleus were applied the specific energy to the analysed nuclei varied from 0 Gy up to about 7 Gy. These variations were due to the stochastic nature of the capture processes. Some helium or lithium ion tracks passed through the centre of the cell nuclei delivering a lot of energy, some passed through only a smaller part delivering small amounts of energy and sometimes the nuclei escaped without any hits at all. The results were obtained when relevant neutron fluencies (2-5 x 10(12) n/cm2) were applied. Increased neutron fluencies gave higher doses both due to capture in boron and in nitrogen but in order to improve the ratio between the dose to targeted tumour cells and the dose to normal cells, the number of 10B atoms in the targeted cells had to be increased and/or the boron placed in the cell nuclei	
3121	Convenient 77Kr production method for medical use	Cerebrovascular Circulation, Humans, Krypton, Krypton/du [Diagnostic Use], Methods, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/du [Diagnostic Use]	A convenient method of 77Kr production has been developed for its routine medical use in cerebral blood flow measurement. An aqueous solution of NaBr (40 wt%) was used as the target and 77Kr produced by the 79Br(p, 3n)77Kr reaction was rapidly recovered from the target under a He stream. The optimal target thickness was determined to be 5 approximately 6 mm by investigating radionuclidic purity and proton current effect on the yield. About 740 MBq (20 mCi) of 77Kr with a radionuclidic purity of 92% was obtained within 5 min after a 5 microA-20 min irradiation. The present method has been demonstrated to be suitable for routine 77Kr production

Respiratory gating should be applied to avoid the use of a large target volume margin that results in a substantial dose to the surrounding normal tissue. Precise respiratory gating requires the exact spatial position of the tumor to be determined in real time during treatment. Usually, fiducial markers are implanted inside or next to the tumor to provide both accurate patient setup and real-time tumor tracking. However, current tumor tracking systems require either substantial x-ray exposure to the patient or large fiducial markers that limit the value of their application for pulmonary tumors. We propose a real-time tumor tracking system using implanted positron emission markers (PeTrack). Each marker will be labeled with low activity positron emitting isotopes, such as 124I, 74As, or 84Rb. These isotopes have half-lives comparable to the duration of radiation therapy (from a few days to a few weeks). The size of the proposed PeTrack marker will be 0.5-0.8 mm, which is approximately one-half the size of markers currently employed in other techniques. By detecting annihilation gammas using position-sensitive detectors, multiple positron emission markers can be tracked in real time. A multimarker localization algorithm was developed using an Expectation-Maximization clustering technique. A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed for the PeTrack system. Patient dose, detector sensitivity, and scatter fraction were evaluated. Depending on the isotope, the lifetime dose from a 3.7 MBq PeTrack marker was determined to be 0.7-5.0 Gy at 10 mm from the marker. At the center of the field of view (FOV), the sensitivity of the PeTrack system was 240-320 counts/s per 1 MBq marker activity within a 30 cm thick patient. The sensitivity was reduced by 45% when the marker was near the edge of the FOV. The scatter fraction ranged from 12% (124I, 74As) to 16% (84Rb). In addition, four markers (labeled with 124I) inside a 30 cm diameter water phantom were simulated to evaluate the feasibility of the multimarker localization algorithm. Localization was considered successful if a marker was localized to within 2 mm from its true location. The success rate of marker localization was found to depend on the number of annihilation events used and the error in the initial estimate of the marker position. By detecting 250 positron annihilation events from 4 markers (average of 62 events per marker), the marker success rates for initial errors of +/-5, +/-10, and +/-15 mm were 99.9%, 99.6%, and 92.4%, respectively. Moreover, the average localization error was 0.55 (+/-0.27) mm, which was independent of initial error. The computing time for localizing four markers was less than 20 ms (Pentium 4, 2.8 GHz processor, 512 MB memory). In conclusion, preliminary results demonstrate that the PeTrack technique can potentially provide real-time tumor tracking with low doses associated with the marker's activity. Furthermore, the small size of PeTrack markers is expected to facilitate implantation and reduce patient risk

Thirty-eight had major surgery before or after irradiation. Major complications (fistula formation, carotid artery exposure or blowout requiring ligation, or major wound breakdown) occurred in 37%. The complication rates associated with surgery prior to irradiation, planned surgery following irradiation, and salvage surgery following irradiation were 0/12, 4/5, and 10/21, respectively. The complication rate for surgery following neutron irradiation alone was 73%; for surgery following mixed-beam irradiation it was 20%. The age of the patient and the interval between surgery and irradiation had no influence on the complication rate

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. Besides sarcomas of the base of skull, which are classical sites for proton beam therapy, it is estimated that about 40 patients yearly in Sweden with sarcomas at other sites are candidates for proton beam therapy. About 20 patients each with malignant lymphomas, chiefly in the mediastinum, and thymomas are also candidates to decrease doses to surrounding heart and lungs. [References: 39]

1130	Advantage of protons compared to conventional X-ray or IMRT in the treatment of a pediatric patient with medulloblastoma	Boston, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Feasibility Studies, Hearing, Heart, Humans, Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Massachusetts, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To compare treatment plans from standard photon therapy to intensity modulated X-rays (IMRT) and protons for craniospinal axis irradiation and posterior fossa boost in a patient with medulloblastoma. METHODS: Proton planning was accomplished using an in-house 3D planning system. IMRT plans were developed using the KonRad treatment planning system with 6-MV photons. RESULTS: Substantial normal-tissue dose sparing was realized with IMRT and proton treatment of the posterior fossa and spinal column. For example, the dose to 90% of the cochlea was reduced from 101.2% of the prescribed posterior fossa boost dose from conventional X-rays to 33.4% and 2.4% from IMRT and protons, respectively. Dose to 50% of the heart volume was reduced from 72.2% for conventional X-rays to 29.5% for IMRT and 0.5% for protons. Long-term toxicity with emphasis on hearing and endocrine and cardiac function should be substantially improved secondary to nontarget tissue sparing achieved with protons. CONCLUSION: The present study clearly demonstrates the advantage of conformal radiation methods for the treatment of posterior fossa and spinal column in children with medulloblastoma, when compared to conventional X-rays. Of the two conformal treatment methods evaluated, protons were found to be superior to IMRT	
2160	Dependence of linac output on the switch rate of an intensity-modulated tomotherapy collimator	Boston, England, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Time, Travel, Universities	The electro-mechanical, multivane intensity modulated collimator ("MIMiC") slit collimator with 40 vanes has been applied in the delivery of inversely planned sequential tomotherapy to over 4,000 patients. The collimator is binary in that each vane switches between fully open or closed status. Resulting beamlet patterns provide the intensity distributions imparting dose to the patient. The bouncing and damping of vanes at the two ends of their travel cause transient dose perturbations near and at the borders of the treatment field. These perturbations are not explicitly modeled by the planning system. Clinical beamlet profiles and output factors may then differ from those in the planning system and as a function of the vane switch period. A mechanical model of vane switching was developed to describe this dependency. Dose output and distribution of seven simple vane patterns with different switch times were measured with ionization chambers and radiographic films in polystyrene and anthropomorphic phantoms. Linac output dependence on switch time relative to vane open time was determined for four intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) patients from measurements of an ionization chamber embedded in a cylindrical polystyrene phantom. Results demonstrate output dependence on switch time and, accordingly, on the servo mechanism for monitor units, arc length, dose rate, and gantry speed. In conclusion, the output dependence borders on clinical significance-improvements to collimator, dose calculation, commissioning, and quality assurance (QA) are suggested	
4367	Precise positioning of patients for radiation therapy	Casts,Surgical, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Immobilization, Movement, Neck, Posture, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Supine Position	We have developed a number of immobilization schemes which permit precise daily positioning of patients for radiation therapy. Pretreatment and post-treatment radiographs have been taken with the patient in the treatment position and analyzed to determine the amount of intratreatment movement. Studies of patients in the supine, seated and decubitus positions indicate mean movements of less than 1 mm with a standard deviation of less than 1mm. Patients immobilized in the seated position with a bite block and a mask have a mean movement of about 0.5 mm +/- 0.3 mm (s.d.), and patients immobilized in the supine position with their necks hyperextended for submental therapy evidence a mean movement of about 1.4 mm +/- 0.9 mm (s.d.). With the exception of those used for the decubitus position, the immobilization devices are simply fabricated out of thermoplastic casting materials readily available from orthopedic supply houses. A study of day-to-day reproducibility of patient position using laser alignment and pretreatment radiographs for final verification of position indicates that the initial laser alignment can be used to position a patient within 2.2 mm +/- 1.4 mm (s.d.) of the intended position. These results indicate that rigid immobilization devices can improve the precision of radiotherapy, which would be advantageous with respect to both tumor and normal tissue coverage in certain situations

This study used the Monte Carlo code MCNPX to determine mean absorbed doses to the embryo and foetus when the mother is exposed to proton fields. Monoenergetic protons ranging from 100 MeV to 100 GeV were considered. The irradiation geometries include antero-posterior (AP), postero-anterior (PA), lateral (LAT), rotational (ROT) and isotropic (ISO). At each of these standard irradiation geometries, absorbed doses to the foetal brain and body were calculated for the embryo of 8 weeks and the foetus of 3, 6 or 9 months. Proton fluence-to-absorbed dose conversion coefficients were derived for the four prenatal ages

The spatial resolution of depth dose distribution in the clinically applied beam intensity is estimated about 3 mm by means of TOF measurement. The dependence of the acoustic signal intensity on the temperature of medium was examined. Proportionality of acoustic pulse intensity to absorbed dose per pulse was confirmed as well. These results suggest the possibility of clinical application to monitor dose distribution in the patient's body during irradiation of pulsed proton beam

Less known is the influence of such diagnostic findings on decisions of the therapist. An analysis of this influence might help to compare the value of CT and MRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 104 treated patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx (n = 54) and the paranasal sinuses (n = 50). The study analyzed the influence of CT on primary tumor diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment decision, therapy planning, detection and time of recurrences and retreatment of relapses. RESULTS: Tumors of the nasopharynx: The value of CT for tumor staging was 76% but there was no influence on treatment decision. Radiotherapy planning was influenced in 37% of cases. CT for follow-up was done in 22% of cases. Most relapses occurred within the first 2 years. Paranasal sinus tumors: There was no influence of CT on primary diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor staging was influenced by CT in 94%, treatment decision in 44% and radiotherapy planning in 60%. CT control immediately after therapy was of value in 40%. Most relapses were found within 3 years but some in the 4th and 5th year. Some patients survived 3 to 9 years after retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In tumors of the nasopharynx there is less influence of CT on therapy strategies than diagnostic radiologists might think. No CT is needed for treatment decision since radiotherapy is the only choice of treatment. CT influenced radiotherapy planning however, in about 1/3 of our cases answering sufficiently the 2 main questions: tumor spread into the anterior half of the facial skull or involvement of the base of skull. The retreatment of recurrences detected by CT showed poor results. Late recurrences seem to have better prognosis. We recommend therefore routinely 1 basic CT 6 months after primary treatment followed by 1 CT yearly from the 3rd to 5th year. MRT might offer more diagnostic details than CT. However, at present therapy is not influenced much by this. Since CT is cheaper and faster, MRT could be discussed as additional procedure when CT presents equivocal findings and this fact could be decisive for therapy planning. Paranasal sinus tumors: The influence of CT on tumor-staging and treatment decision is high and convincing. CT helps also at radiotherapy planning and control of tumor response after therapy. CT has high value in detecting recurrences. Retreatment could control disease in some of our patients for 3 to 9 years. Better results could be achieved possibly with earlier diagnosis of recurrence. We propose therefore a basic-CT 6 months after first treatment and 1 CT routinely from the 2nd to 5th year. From the therapist's point of view we recommend CT as first imaging procedure in sinonasal tumors. MRT, more time- and cost consuming, should be applied when CT is equivocal and treatment decision could be influenced

The results reported were obtained in 16 different centres and concern 23 accelerators, 14 cobalt units and 14 simulators. In general, the deviations observed for accelerators and simulators are smaller than for cobalt units. A single score, based on the deviations observed for the mechanical checks, is attributed to each centre

2052	Intensity modulated radiotherapy with charged particle beams: studies of inverse treatment planning for rotation therapy	Biophysics, Germany, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Rotation	The optimization of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for charged particle beams is a necessary prerequisite to evaluate the clinical potential of this treatment modality in comparison to IMRT with high energy photons. A theoretical study for IMRT with charged particle beams delivered by rotation therapy is presented. First, the inverse problem for two-dimensional rotation therapy with arbitrary depth dose curves is formulated. Then a numerical strategy is devised to calculate fluence profiles for the simplified case of arbitrary rotationally invariant dose distributions. This mathematical framework is applied to study various aspects of charged particle IMRT. A central topic of the investigation is the evaluation of dose delivery, based on distal edge tracking (DET) and intensity modulation. The potential of DET-IMRT with charged particle beams is studied in comparison to an optimal, conventional dose delivery technique, which employs the concept of a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). Moreover, a comparison to photon IMRT is provided for simple geometric dose patterns. The technique of DET-IMRT for the delivery of a homogeneous target dose is only feasible for targets up to a critical radius, depending on the individual shape of the employed Bragg peak. The irradiation of larger targets requires energy modulation in addition to the range modulation for DET. The accurate placement of the Bragg peak with respect to the target edge is found to be of potential importance. Comparing dose delivery via DET-IMRT with the optimal SOBP technique revealed a significant advantage of DET-IMRT, especially a saved integral dose in target-adjacent healthy tissues of up to 30%, and a reduction of the penumbra at the target edge by almost 50%. A saving in integral dose to healthy tissues by a factor of 2-3 was observed for DET-IMRT in comparison to IMRT with high energy photons

By one-dimensional and two-dimensional homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy of the complex of the ras(L61/1-171) protein and GDP, the ribose H1', H2', H3', and H4' proton resonances of the bound GDP were identified. The guanine H8 proton resonance of the bound GDP was identified by substituting [8-2H]GDP for GDP. The dependences of the H1' and H8 proton resonance intensities on the duration of irradiation of the H1', H2', H3', and H8 protons were measured. By numerical simulation of these time-dependent NOE profiles, the conformation of the protein-bound GDP was elucidated; the guanosine moiety takes the anti form about the N-glycosidic bond with a dihedral angle of chi = -124 +/- 2 degrees and the ribose ring takes the C2'-endo form. Such an analysis of the conformation of a guanine nucleotide as bound to a GTP-binding protein will be useful for further studies on the molecular mechanism of the conformational activation of ras proteins on ligand substitution of GDP with GTP

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases	
4186	Double strand breaks induced by low doses of gamma rays or heavy ions: quantitation in nonradioactive human DNA	Cell Line,Transformed, Cesium Radioisotopes, Deoxyribonucleases,Type II Site-Specific/me [Metabolism], DNA, DNA Damage, DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Electrophoresis, Electrophoresis,Gel,Pulsed-Field, Electrophoresis/mt [Methods], Gamma Rays, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Iron, Methods, Radioisotopes, Research	We have developed a method of quantitating low frequencies (0-30 sites/10(9) base pairs) of double strand breaks in approximately 1 microgram of nonradioactive human DNA. Unirradiated or irradiated DNA is digested with the restriction endonuclease NotI, producing cleavage fragments that include a major group centered at approximately 1.2-1.3 Mbp. The DNA molecules are separated as a function of size by transverse alternating field electrophoresis. The frequency of double strand breaks is computed directly from the decrease in number average molecular length induced in the 1.2- to 1. 3-Mbp cleavage fragment group by 137Cs gamma or Fe26+ (1.1 GeV/nucleon) irradiation vs the corresponding unirradiated DNA samples. The double strand break frequency can be quantitated easily in the dose range of 0-10 cGy of gamma rays. The frequency of breaks per unit dose calculated for gamma irradiation of DNA in human cells (approximately 4.6 double strand breaks/10(9) bp/Gy) is within the range of values obtained by others (2-8 sites/10(9) bp/Gy) who used methods requiring higher doses	
1822	Characterization of the output for helical delivery of intensity modulated slit beams	Algorithms, Energy Transfer, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Sensitivity and Specificity	The UW tomotherapy workbench utilizes a convolution/superposition based dose calculation and optimization program. It specifies the energy fluence that must be delivered from each leaf for each phantom projection angle. This requires that the spectrum of the radiation emitted from the one-dimensional MLC (multileaf collimator) attached to the linear accelerator be determined. The steps involved in that process are described. The spectrum along the central axis of the slit beam was determined, as well as the softening with off-axis position. Moreover, the magnitude of the energy-fluence output had to be quantified on a per MU (monitor unit) basis. This was done for a single leaf along the central axis of the beam. Factors, which modify that energy-fluence output, were investigated. The output increases with off-axis position due to the horns of the beam. The output for a leaf of interest will also increase if additional leaves are open due to the absence of the tongue-and-groove effect and penumbra blurring. The energy-fluence increase per leaf increase by 4.9% if an adjacent leaf is open. No other factors related to the state of additional leaves were found to significantly increase the energy-fluence output for an individual leaf

Tissue phantom ratios (TRP's) and percent depth dose data are given; for a 10 x 10 cm field, the percent depth dose at a depth of 10 cm is 78.5 (SSD 100 cm). The relative dose factors (RDF'S) are given and are analyzed to elucidate the relative contributions from phantom scatter, collimator scatter, and backscatter from the top of the collimators into the monitor chambers. The effect of field size and depth on the penumbra is described. Crossplots of the beam at a depth of 5 cm indicate that the flattening filter could be improved; there are hot spots of 108% near the corners of 40 x 40 fields

[Italian]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Care, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time, Wound Healing	We evaluated the tolerance of a single dose of 800-1500 cGy, delivered with an electron beam from an IOERT-dedicated linear accelerator to the tumour bed in patients with breast cancer undergoing conservative treatment, instead of the traditional boost. We enrolled 27 patients (cT1-2, cN0). The first 6 received a dose of 800 cGy, 6 1000 cGy, 10 1200 cGy and 5 1500 cGy. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with a conventional schedule, 4000 cGy total dose, was performed after wound healing. The median gap between IOERT and EBRT was 8 weeks. Three patients with adverse prognostic factors undergoing chemotherapy, including doxorubicin or taxanes, received EBRT after completion of chemotherapy. One patient with a prosthesis implant had yielding of the surgical scar 8 months after IOERT (after 4 cycles of doxorubicin and 4 cycles of CMF complicated by frequent mastitis). Another patient with a large serum collection in the axilla manifested delayed scar formation. In the others no significant increase in healing time or surgery-related morbidity was observed. Another 4 patients developed mastitis. The cosmetic outcome was good in 26/27 patients. This treatment is well tolerated at all IOERT doses delivered. In the follow-up, to date, there have been no local relapses

(1) At least two kinds of free radical signals, a narrow signal and a broad one, were detected at around g = 2.004. The latter is similar to that observed upon irradiation of a model solution containing both tryptophan and cysteine. (2) Two spin adducts were detected upon irradiation of canine lens in the presence of a spin trapping reagent (DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide), i.e. a spin adduct of sulphur-centered radical (most likely glutathione thiyl radical) and the protonated adduct of solvated electron (presumably due to photo-ionization of tryptophan). (3) A tentative and simplified reaction mechanism of UV-induced damage is discussed on the basis of these observations

Among these 86 cases were admitted primarily with view of treatment. Within the period conception of therapy was changed drastically. Where as in former time treatment consists in excision of the tumour with following conventional X-ray therapy, since 1973 therapy of choice was radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphonodectomy. Based on these facts a retrospective comparison of the survival rates in possible, particularly distribution of stages is likely the same in the two groups. The group treated since 1973 has essential better survival rates. This can be attributed to the conception of radical operative treatment preferred in literature predominantly. Mortality rate is below 5 per cent which will be favourable in the geriatric clientele. To make the results of treatment comparable internationally a postoperative classification should be proposed like in breast cancer. The question of the position of an additional postoperative irradiation is to be answered only with aid of a prospective multicenter study

Eight patients (seven males and one female) were suffering from over-irradiation syndrome as a result of treatments from a malfunctioning linear electron accelerator. The mean accidental estimated dose was 136 Gy delivered to the "open-neck" (seven cases) and to the thoracic wall (one case), during a mean of 5.4 sessions (range 1-9 sessions). Paresthesia and weakness in the upper extremities were the earliest symptoms (87.5 %), with evolution to paralysis in all patients. No patient is alive (mean survival time 64 days). In all cases MRI was negative for neurologic lesions in the acute phase ( < 90 days from irradiation; Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system). Late signs of radiation myelitis manifested as high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images in three patients, and as Gd-DTPA enhancement of T1-weighted images in one case. Autopsies performed on four patients who died in acute phase showed morphologic alterations in white matter: edema in 75 %, and necrosis and glial reaction as well as obliterative vasculitis in all cases. In cases of over-irradiation, MRI may be normal in acute phase even if the patients have severe neurologic deficit, as positive MRI findings appear only in delayed radiation myelitis

1274	Radiation therapy for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma	Aged, Biopsy,Needle, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/su [Surgery], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hepatectomy/mt [Methods], Humans, Japan, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk Assessment, Sampling Studies, Survival, Survival Analysis, Time, Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

2899	Dosimetry of centrally shielded electron beams	Canada, Electrons, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Universities	In electron beams, the dose in phantom under the central shielding depends on electron-beam energy, depth in phantom, and shield area and thickness. In our experiments, all shield thicknesses were larger than the range of electrons in the shield material. At a given depth, the dose under the shield never exceeds the open field value; however, it can attain quite a large proportion of the open field value despite a shield thickness which exceeds the range of electrons in the shield material. The effects of shield area on the dose under the central shields were studied in detail and dose distributions are given as a function of shield lateral dimensions and electron-beam energy. It is shown that in clinical use of central shielding, the best approach to dose estimation under the shield is direct measurement in phantom under conditions of the actual clinical setup	
1413	Drinking beer reduces radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes	Adult, Beer, Carbon, Chromosome Aberrations, Drinking, Female, Humans, Ions, Japan, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/ph [Physiology], Mitotic Index, Radiation, Research, X-Rays	We here investigated and reported the effects of beer drinking on radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in blood lymphocytes. Human blood that was collected either before or after drinking a 700 ml beer was in vitro irradiated with 200 kVp X rays or 50 keV/microm carbon ions. The relation between the radiation dose and the aberration frequencies (fragments and dicentrics) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower for lymphocytes collected 3 h after beer drinking than those before drinking. Fitting the dose response to a linear quadratic model showed that the alpha term of carbon ions was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by beer drinking. A decrease of dicentric formation was detected as early as 0.5 h after beer drinking, and lasted not shorter than 4.5 h. The mitotic index of lymphocytes was higher after beer drinking than before, indicating that a division delay would not be responsible for the low aberrations induced by beer drinking. An in vitro treatment of normal lymphocytes with 0.1 M ethanol, which corresponded to a concentration of 6-times higher than the maximum ethanol concentration in the blood after beer drinking, reduced the dicentric formation caused by X-ray irradiation, but not by carbonion irradiation. The beer-induced reduction of dicentric formation was not affected by serum. It is concluded that beer could contain non-ethanol elements that reduce the chromosome damage of lymphocytes induced by high-LET radiation	
4146	Results of neutron radiosurgery for inoperable arteriovenous malformations of the brain	Adult, Brain, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ep [Epidemiology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Research, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Washington	Twenty patients with inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain were treated with neutron radiosurgery. A 50 MeV cyclotron was used to deliver 9 Gy in a single fraction through 7 to 14 isocentric portals. The size and shape of the portals were customized to each treatment site. Nineteen patients have been followed for a median duration of 24 months following neutron radiosurgery. A radiographically demonstrable partial response was seen in 8 patients (42%). No complete responses were observed. There has been one post-treatment hemorrhage, no fatalities, and no evidence of radiation toxicity. The low response rate and absence of toxicity suggest that the appropriate dose for neutron radiosurgical treatment of AVMs is higher than the dose of 9 Gy at isocenter used in this initial study

The incidence of side effects has been low. Only 30 patients, 8.6%, have died, most of preexisting cardiovascular complications. Heavy particle therapy provides a form of treatment with no mortality and extremely low morbidity, and its use in treating pituitary disorders has resulted in dramatic improvement in the signs and symptoms of patients with acromegaly and Cushing disease	
3799	New compensator design options for charged-particle radiotherapy	California, Californium, Equipment Design, Humans, Motion, Movement, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skull Base, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods], Universities	The purpose of this investigation is to propose new compensator design strategies for protons and heavier particles which are based on pencil-beam (PB) dose calculations and which significantly reduce the dose to tissues downstream from the target, yet provide acceptable target coverage under conditions of patient motion. Averaging and expansion operations are provided to improve the target coverage if the patient moves slightly during treatment, and a structure-sparing option is provided to protect critical structures lying downstream from the target. The new compensator design options were evaluated for two patients who had skull-base tumours. When the patient and compensator were perfectly aligned, the new PB compensator designs provided target coverage comparable to, if not better than, standard compensator designs for both patients. Furthermore, the volume of normal tissue distal to the target which received in excess of 95% of the prescription dose was roughly a factor of two lower for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In the event of patient motion, on average, the volume of the target receiving 95% or more of the prescribed dose was 3% less for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In conclusion, the new compensator design options evaluated in this investigation provide better protection for normal tissues distal to the target volume than standard compensator designs, with only a modest decrease in target volume coverage in the event of patient motion	
756	Cancer radioimmunotherapy with alpha-emitting nuclides. [Review] [142 refs]	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Animals, Clinical Trials as Topic, France, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/mt [Methods], Radioimmunotherapy/td [Trends], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/tu [Therapeutic Use]	In lymphoid malignancies and in certain solid cancers such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, somewhat mixed success has been achieved when applying radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters for the treatment of refractory cases. The development of novel RIT with alpha-emitters has created new opportunities and theoretical advantages due to the high linear energy transfer (LET) and the short path length in biological tissue of alpha-particles. These physical properties offer the prospect of achieving selective tumoural cell killing. Thus, RIT with alpha-emitters appears particularly suited for the elimination of circulating single cells or cell clusters or for the treatment of micrometastases at an early stage. However, to avoid non-specific irradiation of healthy tissues, it is necessary to identify accessible tumoural targets easily and rapidly. For this purpose, a small number of alpha-emitters have been investigated, among which only a few have been used for in vivo preclinical studies. Another problem is the availability and cost of these radionuclides; for instance, the low cost and the development of a reliable actinium-225/bismuth-213 generator were probably determining elements in the choice of bismuth-213 in the only human trial of RIT with an alpha-emitter. This article reviews the literature concerning monoclonal antibodies radiolabelled with alpha-emitters that have been developed for possible RIT in cancer patients. The principal radio-immunoconjugates are considered, starting with physical and chemical properties of alpha-emitters, their mode of production, the possibilities and difficulties of labelling, in vitro studies and finally, when available, in vivo preclinical and clinical studies.

3150	Hypersensitivity to very-low single radiation doses: its relationship to the adaptive response and induced radioresistance. [Review] [71 refs]	Adaptation,Physiological/re [Radiation Effects], Animals, Apoptosis, Cell Cycle, Cell Death/re [Radiation Effects], Chlamydomonas/re [Radiation Effects], Cricetinae, DNA, DNA Repair, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Hydrogen, Mammals, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects]	There is now little doubt of the existence of radioprotective mechanisms, or stress responses, that are upregulated in response to exposure to small doses of ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging agents. Phenomenologically, there are two ways in which these induced mechanisms operate. First, a small conditioning dose (generally below 30 cGy) may protect against a subsequent, separate, exposure to radiation that may be substantially larger than the initial dose. This has been termed the adaptive response. Second, the response to single doses may itself be dose-dependent so that small acute radiation exposures, or exposures at very low dose rates, are more effective per unit dose than larger exposures above the threshold where the induced radioprotection is triggered. This combination has been termed low-dose hypersensitivity (HRS) and induced radioresistance (IRR) as the dose increases. Both the adaptive response and HRS/IRR have been well documented in studies with yeast, bacteria, protozoa, algae, higher plant cells, insect cells, mammalian and human cells in vitro, and in studies on animal models in vivo. There is indirect evidence that the HRS/IRR phenomenon in response to single doses is a manifestation of the same underlying mechanism that determines the adaptive response in the two-dose case and that it can be triggered by high and low LET radiations as well as a variety of other stress-inducing agents such as hydrogen peroxide and chemotherapeutic agents although exact homology remains to be tested. Little is currently known about the precise nature of this underlying mechanism, but there is evidence that it operates by increasing the amount and rate of DNA repair, rather than by indirect mechanisms such as modulation of cell-cycle progression or apoptosis. Changed expression of some genes, only in response to low and not high doses, may occur within a few hours of irradiation and this would be rapid enough to explain the phenomenon of induced radioresistance although its specific molecular components have yet to be identified.

572	Influence of alpha and gamma radiations and non-radiation risk factors on the incidence of malignant liver tumors among Mayak PA workers	Alpha Particles, Biophysics, Body Burden, Case-Control Studies, Cohort Studies, Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Incidence, Liver Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Nuclear Reactors/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Occupational Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Occupational Exposure/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Russia/ep [Epidemiology]	This Mayak worker-based study focuses on evaluating possible associations between malignant liver cancers and chronic alpha irradiation, chronic gamma irradiation, and non-radiation risk factors (alcohol consumption, smoking, viral hepatitis, chemical exposure, and chronic digestive diseases). This is the first multivariate study related to liver cancer among Mayak workers. The study was performed using the nested, case-control approach and includes 44 cases of malignant liver tumors diagnosed from 1972 to 1999, and 111 matched controls. Adjusted odds ratio (OR(ad)) was evaluated relative to a group of workers with alpha radiation doses to liver (D(alpha)) < 2.0 Gy. Dose estimates of D(alpha) > 2.0 Gy (corresponding (239)Pu body burden estimates >20.4 kBq) were significantly associated (p < 0.003) with the occurrence of hemangiosarcomas (HAS) but only marginal significance (0.05 < p < 0.1) was found for hepatocellular cancers (HCC). The ORad for HAS was 41.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6, 333] for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-5.0 Gy and was 62.5 (7.4, 500) for a group with D(alpha) > 5.0-16.9 Gy. The attributable risk (AR) was calculated as 82%. For HCC, O(Rad) was estimated as 8.4 (0.8, 85.3; p < 0.07) for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-9.3 Gy. For the indicated group, the AR was 14%. An association with high external gamma-ray doses (D(gamma)) to the total body was revealed for both HCC and for combined liver cancers when dose was treated as a continuous variable. However, we find no evidence that chronic low doses of gamma rays are associated with liver cancer occurrence. Cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) was not associated with either alpha- or gamma-ray exposure. As expected, an association between alcohol abuse and HCC was inferred [O(Rad) = 3.3 (1.2, 9); AR = 41%] but not for CHC or HAS

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects

In such patients, breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by breast irradiation is generally considered contraindicated owing to the high cumulative radiation dose. Mastectomy is therefore recommended as the first option treatment in these women. METHODS: Six patients affected by early breast cancer previously treated with mantle radiation for HD underwent BCS associated with full-dose intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT). RESULTS: A total dose of 21 Gy (prescribed at 90% isodose) in five cases and 17 Gy (at 100% isodose) in one case were delivered directly to the mammary gland without acute complications and with good cosmetic results. After an average of 30.8 months of follow up, no late sequelae were observed and the patients are free of disease. CONCLUSION: In patients previously irradiated for HD, ELIOT can avoid repeat irradiation of the whole breast, permit BCS and decrease the number of avoidable mastectomies

The NIRS (National Institute For Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan) was the first dedicated medical centre for cancer with more than 1200 patients exclusively treated with carbon ion from 1994. A three-year 70 to 100% local control was reported for radio-resistant cancers, supporting the use of high LET particles. Hypo-fractionation was particularly explored for lung cancers and hepatocarcinoma (4 sessions only). Dose escalation studies demonstrated a tumour dose-effect and permitted to precise dose constraints for healthy tissues especially for the rectum. More than 140 patients were treated with carbon ion exclusively or associated with photons since 1997 in the GSI laboratory Gesellschaft Fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany). A very high local control was also obtained for radioresistant cancer of the base of the skull. Preliminary clinical data seem to confirm the expected therapeutic gain with light ions, due to their ballistic and radio-biological properties, and justify the European projects for the construction of dedicated medical facilities for cancers. The French "Etoile" project will be integrated in the European hadrontherapy network "Enlight", with the objectives to coordinate technologic, medical and economic features	
4750	Proton beam radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma: the Liverpool-Clatterbridge experience	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Choroid Neoplasms, Cyclotrons, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, pathology, Patients, Prospective Studies, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Safety, surgery, Survival Analysis, Treatment Failure, Universities, Vision, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: To report on outcomes after proton beam radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma using a 62-MeV cyclotron in patients considered unsuitable for other forms of conservative therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location	
2057	Evaluation of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other tremors: survival of neurons adjacent to the thalamic lesion after gamma thalamotomy	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neurologic Examination, Parkinson Disease/di [Diagnosis], Parkinson Disease/su [Surgery], Radiation, Radiosurgery, Survival, Thalamus/pa [Pathology], Thalamus/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome, Tremor/di [Diagnosis], Tremor/su [Surgery], Ventral Thalamic Nuclei/pa [Pathology], Ventral Thalamic Nuclei/su [Surgery]	OBJECT: The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. METHODS: Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T2-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases	
2533	DNA cell cycle studies in uveal melanoma	Aged, Biopsy, Bromodeoxyuridine/me [Metabolism], California, Californium, Cell Cycle, Cell Cycle/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Separation, Cells,Cultured, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Ciliary Body, DNA, DNA/me [Metabolism], Flow Cytometry, Helium, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Radiation, Research, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	We analyzed the cell cycling status of a group of irradiated and nonirradiated uveal melanomas using BrdUrd techniques. These data demonstrate that melanomas are relatively slow-growing tumors with a few cells actively cycling at a given time. Radiation has a profound effect on the number of cycling cells (P less than .0001). After treatment with either 20 Gy of pre-enucleation photon or 60 Gy or more of helium ion irradiation, virtually no cells are detected in the synthesis phase of the DNA cell cycle. It is unclear whether the absence of cycling cells after 20 Gy of photon irradiation is permanent or represents a transient cell cycle block, since these tumors were studied within 48 hours after irradiation. In contrast, all melanomas treated with helium ion had been irradiated several months prior to enucleation (mean, 2 years). In the latter group of tumors, the length of time between treatment and cell cycle analysis suggests that these cells had lost their reproductive integrity. These data were substantiated by tissue culture studies. Growth of tumor explants was significantly less (P less than .007) in irradiated than in nonirradiated melanomas. The optimum technology used for measurement of cell cycle status remains to be determined. Measurement of BrdUrd uptake using immunofluorescent microscopy on either standard sections or fine-needle biopsies can be performed. In general, flow cytometric analysis yields similar results. It is difficult with the latter technique to be certain that nontumor cells are not artifactitiously counted in the cell cycle studies. The incorporation of BrdUrd cell cycle analysis with fine-needle biopsy may be useful in the clinical management of irradiated melanomas that have questionable growth after treatment. In a few cases studied, results appeared to correlate with tumor growth activity

This dose is often limited by the tolerance of normal organs (rectum, bladder). Conformal beam therapy takes advantage of the unique depth dose characteristics of heavy charged particles (the Bragg Peak) to escalate the radiation dose delivered to the prostate while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. METHOD: 643 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons alone or a combination of protons and photons. All treatment was planned on a 3-D planning system and all received doses between 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE/day. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response to treatment. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates for the entire group are 89 and 79% respectively. A statistically significant difference in biochemical disease-free survival was seen between patients in the "early" (T1b-2b, PSA < 15) and "advanced" (T1b-2b, PSA > 15 or T2c-T4, PSA < 50) subgroups (89% vs. 68% at 4.5 years, p < 0.001). A PSA nadir of less than 0.51 ng/ml predicted for the highest chance of freedom from biochemical recurrence. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton beams therapy produced high rates of response and minimal toxicity. A phase III dose escalation trial is in progress to help define the optimum radiation dose for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer	
153	Apoptosis induced by heavy ion (carbon) irradiation of two human tumours with different radiosensitivities in vivo: relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon beam	Animals, Apoptosis, Apoptosis/re [Radiation Effects], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Ependymoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Incidence, Ions, Mice, Mice,Inbred BALB C, Neoplasm Transplantation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time Factors, Transplantation,Heterologous, X-Rays	The effect of heavy ion (carbon beam) on apoptosis in vivo was studied. The human brain tumors xenografts of different radiosensitivities were used. The results demonstrated that the effect of carbon beam on apoptosis was similar to photon in radiosensitive tumors; however, carbon beam had the advantage on apoptosis in radioresistant tumors. In ependymoblastoma, a radiosensitive tumor, the incidence of apoptosis induced by photon and by carbon at 6 hours after irradiation were 34.5 +/- 7.85% and 32.5 +/- 7.04%, respectively. In glioblastoma (radioresistant tumor), the incidence of apoptosis induced by photon and by carbon at 6 hours after irradiation were 1.35 +/- 1.68% and 4.4 +/- 2.47%, respectively. Therefore, the incidence of apoptosis was increased more than 3-fold (RBE 3.0) at 6 hours after irradiation in glioblastoma. The heavy ion (carbon) beam is effective in radioresistant tumors in vivo	
380	Survival after primary enucleation for choroidal melanoma: changes induced by the introduction of conservative therapies	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Eye Enucleation/mo [Mortality], Female, Humans, Knowledge, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: Most uveal melanomas are currently treated by eye-preserving radiotherapies. However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling	
797	The effect of irradiation modification and RGD sequence adsorption on the response of human osteoblasts to polycaprolactone	Adsorption, Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects], Cell Size/de [Drug Effects], Cell Survival/de [Drug Effects], Cells,Cultured, Coated Materials,Biocompatible/ch [Chemistry], Coated Materials,Biocompatible/pd [Pharmacology], Coated Materials,Biocompatible/re [Radiation Effects], Cytoskeleton/de [Drug Effects], Cytoskeleton/ul [Ultrastructure], Heavy Ions, Humans, Italy, Materials Testing, Oligopeptides/ch [Chemistry], Oligopeptides/pd [Pharmacology], Osteoblasts/cy [Cytology], Osteoblasts/de [Drug Effects], Osteoblasts/ph [Physiology], Polyesters/an [Analysis], Polyesters/ch [Chemistry], Polyesters/re [Radiation Effects], Protein Binding, Research, Surface Properties, Time	Using techniques of tissue engineering, synthetic substitutes can be applied for the repair and regeneration of damaged bone. It has been found that material surface properties are crucial for cell adhesion and spreading, i.e. cell activities that are related directly to the ability of osteoblasts to proliferate. This fact has promoted the strategy of creating an ECM-like layer onto materials, so as to influence the cell response. In this study human bone-derived osteoblasts have been used to test the effects of surface modification by low energy ion beams of a poly epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) substrate and subsequent RGD adsorption. Osteoblasts were seeded and grown onto untreated and irradiated poly epsilon-caprolactone films, with or without RGD-adsorption step, and viability, morphology, and spreading of the osteoblasts were studied at different time endpoints. Differences were observed in the organization of cytoskeleton within cells: stress fibers were more evident in irradiated samples vs. untreated and total cell adhesion was higher. Surface characterization by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, and surface free energy measurements showed that the polar character of PCL, i.e., the acid-base term, was increased following irradiation treatment. Moreover the irradiated PCL had a nano-sized topography, which also could improve osteoblasts adhesion. We found that the treatment of the surface with ion beam is per se improving osteoblasts adhesion and spreading onto PCL. Furthermore, also if a significant RGD adsorption was obtained for irradiated PCL surfaces, it was found that in the investigated conditions it seems to have only a minor effect on the cell response. This study suggests that new strategies involving irradiation-based treatments can be adopted to promote the initial steps of bone deposition onto synthetic surfaces, exploiting the surface-induced reorganization of the ECM matrix	
3669	Two cases of proton MR spectroscopy of the brain after irradiation	Aged, Brain, Brain Chemistry, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Radiation, Universities	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is thought to be more sensitive to radiation damage of the brain than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We presented performed 1H-MRS using the stimulated echo acquisition method (STEAM) for non-tumor sites in 2 patients who received radiation therapy for their brain tumors. In the first case up to 45 days after radiation, we could observe a normal spectra presented three major peaks of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline (Cho). In the second case who had radiation necrosis 1 year after radiation, the spectra showed a decrease in the all peaks beneath the noise level	
3349	Neutron energies in medical electron accelerator rooms	Electrons, Head, Humans, India, Lead, Mathematics, Methods, Microclimate, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Polyethylene, Radiation, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation]	Two experimental methods are described for obtaining average energies of neutron spectra produced by an electron accelerator in a medical treatment room. In the first method, the dose equivalent is measured by means of indium activation foils in an Andersson-Braun moderator. Fluences are determined by the usual activation foil techniques. These data lead to the conversion factor, neutrons/(cm2s) per mrem/h, which uniquely defines the effective energy of the unknown spectrum. In the second method, the fast neutron broad-beam attenuation in polyethylene is obtained from measurement of the thermalized fluence versus depth curve, whose slope in the exponential region parallels that of the fast neutron spectrum. It was found for a 24-MV linear accelerator that the effective energy varied from 0.28 MeV at the isocenter under closed collimators to 0.016-0.024 MeV in the entrance maze. These results compare favorably with other measurements and calculations. It is concluded that the dose equivalent can be measured to within +/- 50% with an activation foil in an Andersson-Braun moderator and that the characteristic energy obtained by attenuation at the isocenter closely approximates the average energy of the neutron spectrum escaping the treatment head

DESIGN: Randomized dose-ranging clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with angiographic evidence of classic choroidal neovascularization resulting from AMD and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better. METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 16-cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) or 24-CGE proton radiation in 2 equal fractions. Visual acuity was measured using standardized protocol refraction. Complete ophthalmological examinations, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of eyes losing 3 or more lines of vision from baseline. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare cumulative rates of vision loss between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS: At 12 months after treatment, 36 eyes (42%) and 27 eyes (35%) lost 3 or more lines of vision in the 16-CGE and 24-CGE groups, respectively. Rates increased to 62% in the 16-CGE group and 53% in the 24-CGE group by 24 months after treatment (P = 0.40). Radiation complications developed in 15.7% of patients receiving 16 CGE and 14.8% of patients receiving 24 CGE. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in rates of visual loss were found between the 2 dose groups. Proton radiation may be useful as an adjuvant therapy or as an alternative for patients who decline or are not appropriate for approved therapies

METHODS: Between 1993 and 2001, 42 patients with meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery at our institution. A mean radiation dose of 14 Gy was delivered to the tumor margin. The median tumor volume was 8.2 cm3 (mean, 8.4 cm3). Median follow-up was 36 months (mean, 38 mo). RESULTS: Control of tumor growth was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. There was no mortality or permanent extraocular motor or pituitary dysfunction. Treatment-related complications included new trigeminal neuropathy in 4.7% and a new visual field defect in 2.8%. Two patients required shunt placement after developing hydrocephalus. One patient with symptomatic temporal lobe edema underwent partial excision of the tumor. Improvement of existing cranial neuropathies was noted in 29% of affected trigeminal nerves, in 22% of oculomotor nerves, and in 13% of Cranial Nerves IV and VI. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that linear accelerator radiosurgery can achieve a high control rate of meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus with no mortality and a low incidence of morbidity	
3141	Second-order multiple-scattering theory for charged-particle teletherapy beams	Electrons, Humans, Mathematics, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Travel	The Fermi-Eyges theory of multiple scattering, applicable to charged-particle teletherapy beams, has been generalized to second order in small quantities representing deviations from the particles' initial lines of travel and direction. The second-order multiple-scattering theory provides increased accuracy, and in particular it takes into account the skewness of the particles' paths, in calculating dose. Only the assumptions and certain results of the second-order theory are presented in this communication, for the immediate use of other investigators. An application to rectangular fields shows that the second-order theory predicts one component of the buildup of electron central axis depth dose, which the (first-order) Fermi-Eyges theory cannot do. (The other major component of buildup, which is not yet incorporated into this theoretical work, is due to high-energy secondary electrons). Various approximate calculations of electron central axis depth dose are compared with the second-order calculation	
788	Biomedical applications of 10B and 11B NMR. [Review] [47 refs]	Animals, Biomedical Engineering/mt [Methods], Biomedical Engineering/td [Trends], Boron, Boron Compounds/me [Metabolism], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Humans, Isotopes, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Metabolic Clearance Rate, Mice, Neutrons, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Time, Tissue Distribution	This review focuses mainly on the detection and investigation of molecules used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) by 10B and 11B NMR. In this binary radiation treatment, boron-containing molecules (also called 'BNCT agents') enriched in the 10B isotope, are targeted to the tumor, and irradiated with thermal or epithermal neutrons. Capture of these neutrons by 10B nuclei generates cell-damaging radiation, confined to single cell dimensions. NMR research efforts have primarily been applied in two directions: first, to investigate the metabolism and pharmaco-kinetics of BNCT agents in-vivo, and second, to use localized NMR spectroscopy and/or MRI for non-invasive mapping of the administered molecules in treated animals or patients. While the first goal can be pursued using 11B NMR for natural-abundance samples (80% 11B / 20% 10B), molecules used in the actual treatment are > 95% enriched in 10B, and must therefore be detected by 10B NMR. Both 10B (spin 3) and 11B (spin 3/2) are quadrupolar nuclei, and their typical relaxation times, in common BNCT agents in biological environments, are rather short. This poses some technical challenges, particularly for MRI, which will be reviewed, along with possible solutions. The first attempts at 11B NMR and MRI detection of BNCT agents in biological tissue were conducted over a decade ago. Since then, results from 11B MRI in laboratory animals and in humans have been reported, and 11B NMR spectroscopy provided interesting and unique information about the metabolism of some BNCT agents in cultured cells. 10B NMR was applied either 'indirectly' (in double-resonance experiments involving coupled protons), but also by direct 10B MRI in mice. However, no results involving the NMR detection of 10B-enriched compounds in treated patients have been reported yet. Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [References: 47]

In 1992 the TERA Foundation was created with the purpose of forming and employing people fully devoted to the design, promotion and construction of hadrontherapy centres in Italy and in Europe. This contribution reviews the present status of therapy with ion beams and describes the main TERA project CNAO (Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica) based on the optimised medical synchrotron designed in the framework of the "Proton Ion Medical Machine Study" (PIMMS) carried out at CERN from 1996 to 1999 with CERN, the Med-AUSTRO project, GSI, Oncology 2000 (Prague) and TERA as partners

2322	Forty years' experience with a special, non-tumorous application of radiotherapy for the eye. [Review] [17 refs]	Eye, Eye Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Inflammation, Macular Degeneration, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Switzerland, Visual Acuity, X-Rays	This paper recapitulates experience made over 40 years with a special nontumorous radiotherapy for the eye. Following a review of the development of therapy, which began with the pendular convergence x-ray machine and later changed to the linear accelerator, an overview is presented of the most important indications for the safe use of x-rays in exudative inflammatory processes in the posterior segment of the eye. We show that in many cases radiotherapy can achieve a permanent improvement for years or at least the preservation of the status quo, while also protecting the important visual cells, especially if it is administered at the earliest possible stage alone. However, it is even more effective in combination with retrobulbar injection therapy that is adjusted individually. Statistics on the results in cases of disciform macular degeneration, doubtlessly the most frequent indication for non-tumorous radiotherapy in the eye, exemplify its efficacy. [References: 17]

Regression analysis of the daily decrement (DD) and the diameter (D) of a tumor mass in each CT observation interval, DD = a*Db, showed that the exponent b was 3.0 or larger in early periods and 2.0 or smaller in late periods. This suggests that the clearance depends initially on the tumor volume, subsequently on the tumor surface area, and then it becomes much more moderate, possibly due to radiation damage to the parenchymal tissues

Since 1972, the aim of my team has been to synthesize tumor-seeking 10B-compounds possessing selective affinity for specific metabolic activity of the target cancer cells. Once the melanoma takes up these 10B compounds, thermal neutrons, which cause insignificant cell damage, are easily absorbed by nonradioactive 10B, inducing the 10B(n, alpha)7Li reaction and releasing the high LET particles to 14 mu melanoma cell diameter, destroying the tumor without damaging surrounding tissue. Radiobiological and preclinical studies culminated in the first successful human NCT treatment, with no recurrence of the treated melanoma since July, 1987. [References: 23]

This work considered several contributing factors, quantified the artefacts, monitored their reproducibility and investigated the effects of repeated gantry rotations. Unflatness of up to 5% was found. A correction technique was devised using nonlinear regression of a three-variable sinusoidal modulation. Comparison with two existing techniques found our method to be the most effective, providing a flatness well within 2%. This improved accuracy is expected to benefit more accurate dosimetric studies in particular. The post-acquisition correction process required no change in imaging protocols. Applicability of the new technique was demonstrated on images acquired on different days and with different beam sizes. Since the artefacts compromise both accurate dosimetry and image quality, their successful removal should benefit a broad range of SLIC EPID applications

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function

All patients referred to radiotherapy were treated by electron beam (10-15 MeV) and followed for more than 5 years. Postoperative radiotherapy after radical operation, with no macroscopic disease, was performed in 18 patients, 7 of whom were treated by radical re-operation and radiation of a recurrent parotid neoplasm. In these groups, the local recurrence rate was 4/18 (22%) and 2/7 (29%), the 5-year survival rate was 9/18 (50%) and 5/7 (71%). In 17 patients, radiotherapy started with gross tumor left behind. This group showed a local recurrence rate of 10/17 (59%) and a 5-year survival of 7/17 (41%). Treatment was well tolerated with no major sequelae. Local tumor control and its impact on survival is discussed

They are slow-growing and usually cause symptoms only when they compress a cranial nerve. RECENT FINDINGS: The MRI will show the lesion with irregular uptake of gadolinium. The only way to define the diagnosis is with tissue, and there are two primary pathologic forms of the disease. Resection approaches vary with extent of disease, surgeon preference, and critical structures involved. SUMMARY: There is building evidence that proton beam therapy improves survival and duration of a disease-free state. [References: 16]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to low LET-irradiation at: (1) low-dose rate (LDR, 1-3 Gy, 0.024 Gy h[-1]) in order to minimize genotoxic stress; (2) high dose rate (HDR, 1-3 Gy, 45 Gy h[-1]) followed by immediate mitogen stimulation; and (3) HDR followed by a recovery period of 5 days before mitogen stimulation. Subsequent analyses included cell viability and clonogenic cell survival, chromosome aberrations at the first post-irradiation mitosis, and karyotype analysis of long term cultured cells, 11-57 days after mitogen stimulation. RESULTS: Dose (1-3 Gy) and dose rate (LDR and HDR) effects on the frequency of dicentric chromosomes at the first post-irradiation mitosis were in agreement with published data, with a pronounced dose rate effect of 2 and 3 Gy exposures. G-handed karyotypes after 11 days of growth in vitro showed increased frequencies of chromosome breaks and rearrangements in all irradiated cell cultures. Clones with complex karyotype abnormalities and increased frequencies of de novo aberrations developed in the irradiated cultures during extended growth for 22-57 days. These results show that: (1) LDR-irradiation induces chromosomal instability in primary human lymphocytes; (2) mitogen stimulation rescues HDR-irradiated cells from death at the expense of an increased level of chromosome aberrations; and (3) HDR-irradiated cells that are allowed 5 days of recovery before mitogen stimulation develop chromosomal instability during subsequent long-term proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the acute genotoxic stress of HDR-irradiation compared with LDR-irradiation, nor the hypothesized conflict between mitogen-induced growth stimulation and irradiation-induced growth arrest, seem to be critical conditions for the development of chromosomal instability in primary human T lymphocytes. Post-irradiation incubation allowing apoptotic processes to remove damaged cells does not prevent the subsequent development of chromosomal instability during long-term cell proliferation	
117	Calculation of absorbed dose distributions from dynamic wedges	Algorithms, Biophysics, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Movement, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Netherlands, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Technology,Radiologic	In radiotherapy with photon beams, the use of dynamic wedges, which are obtained by the movement of one of the jaws, offers an increasing flexibility relative to the traditional use of metal wedges. But it is a disadvantage for the measurement of absorbed dose distributions, because the absorbed dose at each measurement point can only be obtained after a complete movement of the jaw. Consequently, for radiotherapy planning, an algorithm should be available that does not require measurements for any specific dynamically wedged beam, but is based on only a modest number of measurements. In this paper, an algorithm for the calculation of the dose distribution from dynamic wedges is described. This algorithm uses the convolution of pencil beam kernels with a non-uniform field function. These pencil beam kernels are derived from empirical data resulting from measurements of the open beam only

Calculations were based on depth dose data in water obtained from EGS4 based DOSXYZ Monte Carlo simulations. Depth dose data were calculated using different compensator materials as attenuators of variable thickness. The absorbed dose varied exponentially as a function of absorber thickness at any depth in water on the beam axis for all materials. The effective attenuation coefficient data were compared with measurements for wax, aluminum and brass with values from the literature. Theoretical narrow beam linear attenuation coefficients were calculated and compared with the Monte Carlo data. The effective attenuation coefficient data for all materials were parametrized as functions of field size and depth in water. The effective attenuation coefficient was also parametrized as a function of atomic number. It was found that the effective attenuation coefficients calculated from the DOSXYZ data using a simple source model correspond to measured data for wax, aluminum and brass and published data for lead	
2940	Biophysical analysis of the dose-dependent overdispersion and the restricted linear energy transfer dependence expressed in dicentric chromosome data from alpha-irradiated human lymphocytes	Alpha Particles, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Germany, Humans, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Neutrons, Poisson Distribution, Protons	Experimental data for the induction of dicentric chromosomes in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human T lymphocytes by 241Am alpha-particles obtained by Schmid et al. have been analyzed in the light of biophysical theory. As usual in experiments with alpha-particles, the relative variance of the intercellular distribution of the number of aberrations per cell exceeds unity, and the multiplicity of the aberrations per particle traversal through the cell is understood as the basic effect causing this overdispersion. However, the clearly expressed dose dependence of the relative variance differs from the dose-independent relative variance predicted by the multiplicity effect alone. Since such dose dependence is often observed in experiments with alpha-particles, protons, and high-energy neutrons, the interpretation of the overdispersion needs to be supplemented. In a new, more general statistical model, the distribution function of the number of aberrations is interpreted as resulting from the convolution of a Poisson distribution for the spontaneous aberrations with the overdispersed distributions for the aberrations caused by intratrack or intertrack lesion interaction, and the fluctuation of the cross-sectional area of the cellular chromatin must also be considered. Using a suitable mathematical formulation of the resulting dose-dependent over-dispersion, the mean number lambda 1 of the aberrations produced by a single particle traversal through the cell nucleus and the mean number lambda 2 of the aberrations per pairwise approach between two alpha-particle tracks could be estimated. Coefficient alpha of the dose-proportional yield component, when compared between 241Am alpha-particle irradiation and 137Cs gamma-ray exposure, is found to increase approximately in proportion to dose-mean restricted linear energy transfer, which indicates an underlying pairwise molecular lesion interaction on the nanometer scale	
3827	Physical aspects of dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery	Canada, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Rotation, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities	Dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery is a radiosurgical technique based on a medium-energy isocentric linear accelerator and a stereotactic frame. The technique uses concurrent and continuous rotations of both the gantry (300 degrees, from 30 to 330 degrees) and the couch (150 degrees, from 75 to -75 degrees). It gives a uniform dose (+/- 5%) within the target volume and dose fall-offs outside the target volume comparable to those obtained from presently known radiosurgical techniques

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human normal fibroblasts (GM05389) were irradiated with 4.047 (CaK-P), 4.026 (CaK-L) and 4.067 (CaK-H) keV X-rays (corresponding to the resonance absorption edge of the Ca K-shell and slightly below and slightly above the edge, respectively) using synchrotron radiation at the photon factory (PF) of the High Energy Accelerator Organization located in Tsukuba. Chromosomal aberrations induced by the irradiation were analyzed by the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) method using calyculin A. The dependency of the chromosomal aberrations on the incubation time post 2 Gy irradiation was observed for each energy. Irradiation using 200 kVp conventional X-rays was also examined as a reference to CaK irradiation. RESULTS: (1) Soon after irradiation with 2Gy, the enhancement ratios of CaK-H X-rays to CaK-L X-rays were 1.21, 1.51 and 2.70 for breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, respectively. The enhancement ratios of CaK-P X-rays to CaK-L X-rays were 1.82, 0.98 and 6.30, for breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, respectively. (2) After a 6-hr incubation treatment post 2 Gy irradiation, the enhancement ratios of CaK-H X-rays to CaK-L X-rays were 1.59, 2.03 and 2.14 for breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, respectively. The enhancement ratios of CaK-P X-rays to CaK-L X-rays were 1.69, 1.66 and 2.00 for breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, respectively. (3) Soon after irradiation, the ratios of the efficiencies of CaK-P X-rays to those of 200 kVp X-rays were 1.74, 1.29 and 2.51 for breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, respectively. And after a 6-hr incubation treatment, the ratios were 5.50, 1.93 and 1.81 for breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An effective enhancement of chromosomal aberrations, such as breaks/gaps, isochromatid breaks and exchanges, was caused by Ca K-shell ionization or excitation. Auger electrons emitted by Ca atoms in irradiated cells appear to have an important role in causing this enhancement. Comparing these efficiencies of chromosomal aberrations with those produced by 200 kVp conventional X-rays suggests un-repaired and complicated damage is induced by the X-rays around the Ca K-shell resonance absorption edge	
863	General principles for prescribing, recording and reporting a therapeutic irradiation	Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk	Exchange of clinical information is essential for the development and progress in radiation oncology. This goal can be achieved only through a general harmonization on methods of reporting. The ICRU has been involved for several decades in a continuous effort to harmonize reporting of dose and to standardize methods used to determine the doses and points or volumes where these doses are delivered. Requirements for reporting proton and ion beam therapy should, in principle, be as similar as possible to reporting the current radiation therapy modalities. However, proton and ion therapy have their own clinical and technical uniqueness: in particular, they require definition of new clinical, radiobiological and technical concepts, and strict quality assurance programmes for efficient and safe clinical application. The current ICRU definitions of volumes are reviewed: Gross Tumour Volume (GTV), Clinical Target Volume (CTV), Planning Target Volume (PTV), Organs At Risk (OAR), Planning organ at Risk Volume (PRV), treated volume and reference volume. The irradiation conditions and the absorbed dose should always be reported together with the point(s) and/or volume(s) where the dose is delivered. In addition, the weighting factor W(RBE) introduced to take into account the RBE, and the related weighted dose D(RBE) have to be reported

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. With 1H-MRS imaging, high choline with low citrate signal was observed in the prostate, and in the lymph node a signal of choline-containing compounds was identified. The tissue level of the compounds in the enlarged lymph node was estimated to be 8.1 mmol/kg water. Subsequent histopathological analysis of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and computed tomography-guided biopsy of the lymph node confirmed the presence of prostate cancer in both

Ideally, the particle selected to deliver ionizing radiation for routine therapy should control the disease, cause minimal side effects, and be affordable. Two major properties for judging the utility of a particle, physical controllability and selective cell destruction, influence the decision for selection. The proton, at present, has the best combination of capabilities for routine radiation therapy. Heavier ions require further study to determine their role in patient treatment

An attenuator was placed in central beam axis and also in an off-axis geometry. The study was made with a Co-60 radiation and with photons generated by 10 and 23 MV Linac at depths, in phantom, from 5 to 30 cm. To obtain the calculated values of dose-rates; the contributions of the three components to the total dose-rate were measured. The calculated dose-rate distributions agree well with the measured data in case of 10 MV and 23 MV radiation

The melanomas measured 7 to 15 mm at the tumor base and 2 t0 5 mm thick. First, photocoagulation using the green argon laser was aimed at closing the choroidal vascular supply of the tumor. In a second stage, tumor tissue was destroyed using the red krypton laser for confluent burns of long duration. Such treatment was supplemented by cryotherapy in peripherally located tumors or whenever photocoagulation alone did not result in tumor regression. Photocoagulation alone was used in ten eyes and combined wih cryotherapy in seven. After an average follow-up of 42 months, marked tumor regression was achieved in 12 eyes and some tumor regression in two. Tow eyes ultimately required proton beam irradiation, and one eye was enucleated. No metastasis occurred during follow-up

IORT has been recently used in early stage cancer as an exclusive radiation modality, rather than as a boost, especially for breast tumours, in particular at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, where the technique has been called electron intraoperative therapy (ELIOT). Our studies on more than 1000 patients have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique and it is expected that its application will become more widespread in the immediate future. It is important to emphasise that ELIOT relies not only on new technological developments, but also on a multidisciplinary team with clear roles and responsibilities, the establishment of a programme of quality assurance with appropriate guidelines and a comprehensive staff development programme	
1561	Reconstruction of biologically equivalent dose distribution on CT-image from measured physical dose distribution of therapeutic beam in water phantom	Carbon, Humans, Japan, Models,Statistical, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Software, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods], Water	From the standpoint of quality assurance in radiotherapy, it is very important to compare the dose distributions realized by an irradiation system with the distribution planned by a treatment planning system. To compare the two dose distributions, it is necessary to convert the dose distributions on CT images to distributions in a water phantom or convert the measured dose distributions to distributions on CT images. Especially in heavy-ion radiotherapy, it is reasonable to show the biologically equivalent dose distribution on the CT images. We developed tools for the visualization and comparison of these distributions in order to check the therapeutic beam for each patient at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS). To estimate the distribution in a patient, the dose is derived from the measurement by mapping it on a CT-image. Fitting the depth-dose curve to the calculated SOBP curve also gives biologically equivalent dose distributions in the case of a carbon beam. Once calculated, dose distribution information can be easily handled to make a comparison with the planned distribution and display it on a grey-scale CT-image. Quantitative comparisons of dose distributions can be made with anatomical information, which also gives a verification of the irradiation system in a very straightforward way

The microchamber sensitive volume has a diameter of 2 mm, which is smaller than the gamma knife beams, and a length of 5 mm. The chamber was mounted in a custom cassette in a spherical plastic phantom, supplied by Elekta, and oriented in a sagittal plane with the 2-mm dimension at right angles to the transverse plane. The phantom was manually moved across the beam, using the gamma knife x-coordinate trunnions, to measure the profiles. Profiles were also measured with V-film placed in a cassette mounted in the spherical plastic phantom. The films were scanned with a Scanditronix film scanner and converted to dose with a density to dose calibration curve. The results were superimposed for comparison. The beam width at the 50% intensity was measured from the film profiles to give the dimensions of the beams in the orthagonal planes. The ion chamber measurements are compared with the film results for the transverse, x profiles. Good agreement between the film and ion chamber transverse profiles is observed

Differences in intrinsic radiosensitivity and the presence of hypoxic cells are considered to be the main factors which can cause values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for responses of tumours to be larger than RBE values for normal tissue tolerance. Clinical studies on lung metastases irradiated with single doses of 15 MeV neutrons indicate that RBE values for tumour growth delay can vary between 1.2 and 4.0, while RBE values for damage to several normal tissues are estimated from data on a few animal tissues to be approximately 2.5

It decays by the emission of 6.8 MeV mean energy alpha-particles, which from a radiobiological viewpoint are of near optimal therapeutic LET. This paper reviews developments in the possible application of [211At]astato-labelled molecules as potential anti-tumour agents. Additionally, radio-dosimetric evidence is presented, and its implications for human cancer therapy are discussed. [References: 99]

Computer-controlled conformal radiation therapy using asymmetric collimator jaw settings necessitates stable symmetric treatment beams. Long term beam symmetry measurements have been performed on a Philips SL20 dual energy computer-controlled linear accelerator. Symmetry in both the radial and transverse axis of each x-ray beam was monitored for eight gantry positions. These measurements were undertaken to determine the effectiveness of the SL20 beam steering system during dose delivery of 50 monitor units (MU) per field. Evaluation of the data shows that careful beam steering setup procedures result in x-ray beams in which fluctuations in symmetry as a function of gantry angle are within +/- 1.5%. Day to day instabilities produce a total overall variation in beam symmetry on the order of +/- 2.0%. Results suggest the measurement of symmetry as a function of gantry position become a routine quality assurance procedure for this accelerator

The patient maintained good vision until 18 months after therapy, when she developed neovascular glaucoma. This complication required multiple therapeutic procedures, including topical anti-inflammatory and antiglaucomatous drops, 360 degrees peripheral panretinal cryoblation, and a single 180 degrees application of inferior cyclocryotherapy over a 2 1/2-year period. Four weeks after the cyclocryotherapy, inflammation was noted in both eyes, and, one month later, enucleation of the left sympathogenic eye was performed. Serial histopathologic sections showed a full-thickness, fibrovascular, scleral scar and tantalum marker ring suture without uveal incarceration. Penetrating surgical trauma, a uveal melanoma, and multiple nonpenetrating treatments resulted in the development of sympathetic ophthalmia

In spite of the most aggressive therapies, the control of metastatic prostate cancer remains an elusive objective and many patients die of secondary disease. Targeted alpha-therapy is an emerging therapeutic modality whereby a labeled protein selectively targets cancer cells and delivers a lethal payload, which can kill cancer cells in transit or preangiogenic cell clusters. Recent studies show that targeted alpha-therapy is highly cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells in vitro and can inhibit tumor growth in animal models. This review will consider alpha-emitting radionuclides and current in vitro and in vivo studies with alpha-radioconjugates, and will focus on cell-surface target antigens and targeting vectors for the treatment of prostate cancer.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective longitudinal study of 485 low back pain patients was carried. We assess the type of pain and its irradiation, evolution in time, duration of the episodes, timetable, intensity and morning stiffness. A complete physical examination with specific tests for sacroiliac joints and neurologic examination was carried. We carried out a study of absolute and relative frequencies; calculating the rates with the chi 2 Pearson test and having a confidence of 95%. RESULTS: We found a significant relation (p < 0.0001) between the type of pain and the diagnosis groups. Proximal irradiation with functional disorders (p < 0.01) and metabolic bone diseases (p < 0.0001); the radicular irradiation and the disorders by physical agents (p < 0.001). The flare-up back pain with disorders by physical agents and metabolic bone diseases (p < 0.001). The morning stiffness was exclusive in the inflammatory diseases. In the physical examination, was found a significant relation (p < 0.0001) between the different tests with the diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: The history and the physical examination provide us symptoms and signs which let us direct towards the above diagnostic. The type of pain with its characteristics and the referred pain as a main symptoms, give us some information, which complemented with the physical examination tests, providing the base on which we support our diagnostic hypothesis, allow us the first classification of the patients; at the same time we understand as a low back pain patients suffer its problem

[Review] [19 refs] [Italian]	Electromagnetic Fields, Humans, Kinetics, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/ae [Adverse Effects], Magnetics/ae [Adverse Effects], Occupational Diseases/et [Etiology], Occupational Exposure, Risk, Risk Factors	It was observed that "medical diagnosis utilizing Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanners may be one of the first modalities in which there is more risk for the operator of the equipment than for the patient" (Young, 1984). Despite this statement, only a few studies have been devoted to the assessment of occupational hazard in MR imaging personnel. The principal features associated with MR systems are: static magnetic fields, time-varying magnetic fields, and radiofrequency irradiation. Potential medical effects related to these hazards are reviewed. Static magnetic fields are known to induce in vitro changes in enzyme kinetics, orientation changes of macromolecules and subcellular components, distortion of ion currents and magnetohydrodynamic effects. Possible mechanisms for static magnetic field bioeffects include the exertion of magnetic forces, the induction of voltages, and other mechanisms (proton tunneling, ion cyclotron resonance) that are yet scarcely known. Human epidemiological studies on static magnetic fields are mainly based on subjective observations, and lack adequate control for confounding factors. Time-varying magnetic fields in the extremely-low frequency range have been associated with both occupational and non-occupational adverse health effects. Exposure to electromagnetic fields in office workers has been related to an increased rate of abortion; the vast majority of studies in this field, however, did not reach any significant result. Many literature reports support the evidence of an elevation of cancer risk in subjects exposed to residential and occupational ELF fields. Although such observations are not yet proved, the alleged occupational risk in magnetic fields exposure should induce to optimize exposure in MR imaging workers. [References: 19]

Until radiation therapy gained wide acceptance in the 1980s, enucleation was the standard treatment for the tumor. Long-term results after proton beam irradiation are now available. METHODS: We developed risk score equations to estimate probabilities of the 4 principal treatment outcomes-local tumor recurrence, death from metastasis, retention of the treated eye, and vision loss-based on an analysis of 2069 patients treated with proton beam radiation for intraocular melanoma between July 10, 1975, and December 31, 1997. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 9.4 years. RESULTS: Tumor regrowth occurred in 60 patients, and 95% of tumors (95% confidence interval, 93%-96%) were controlled locally at 15 years. Risk scores were developed for the other 3 outcomes studied. Overall, the treated eye was retained by 84% of patients (95% confidence interval, 80%-87%) at 15 years. The probabilities for vision loss (visual acuity worse than 20/200) ranged from 100% to 20% at 10 years and for death from tumor metastases from 95% to 35% at 15 years, depending on the risk group. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose radiation treatment was highly effective in achieving local control of intraocular melanomas. In most cases, the eye was salvaged, and functional vision was retained in many patients. The mortality rate was high in an identifiable subset of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapies directed at microscopic liver metastases	
986	Feasibility of synchronization of real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy from viewpoint of excessive dose from fluoroscopy	Air, Calibration, Feasibility Studies, Fluoroscopy, Humans, Japan, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Synchronization of the techniques in real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is expected to be useful for the treatment of tumors in motion. Our goal was to estimate the feasibility of the synchronization from the viewpoint of excessive dose resulting from the use of fluoroscopy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using an ionization chamber for diagnostic X-rays, we measured the air kerma rate, surface dose with backscatter, and dose distribution in depth in a solid phantom from a fluoroscopic RTRT system. A nominal 50-120 kilovoltage peak (kVp) of X-ray energy and a nominal 1-4 ms of pulse width were used in the measurements. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD air kerma rate from one fluoroscope was 238.8 +/- 0.54 mGy/h for a nominal pulse width of 2.0 ms and nominal 100 kVp of X-ray energy at the isocenter of the linear accelerator. The air kerma rate increased steeply with the increase in the X-ray beam energy. The surface dose was 28-980 mGy/h. The absorbed dose at a 5.0-cm depth in the phantom was 37-58% of the peak dose. The estimated skin surface dose from one fluoroscope in RTRT was 29-1182 mGy/h and was strongly dependent on the kilovoltage peak and pulse width of the fluoroscope and slightly dependent on the distance between the skin and isocenter. CONCLUSION: The skin surface dose and absorbed depth dose resulting from fluoroscopy during RTRT can be significant if RTRT is synchronized with IMRT using a multileaf collimator. Precise estimation of the absorbed dose from fluoroscopy during RT and approaches to reduce the amount of exposure are mandatory

Recent results from many laboratories using a variety of cells and cytogenetic end points show that this phenotype can be induced by low as well as high LET irradiation. A typical feature of chromosomal instability in primary human G0-lymphocytes exposed to gamma-irradiation at both high dose rate (45 Gy h-1) and low dose rate (0.024 Gy h-1) is the appearance of novel aberrations in the clonal progeny of the irradiated cell, many generations after the exposure. The same phenotype was observed in lymphocytes that were allowed to recover for 5 days in G0 after the radiation exposure, as well as in hprt-mutant T cell clones. These results demonstrate that neither the acute genotoxic stress caused by high dose rate as compared to low dose rate irradiation, nor a hypothesized conflict between mitogen induced growth stimulation and growth arrest due to radiation damage, seem to be critical conditions for the development chromosomal instability in these cells. In contrast to observations in other cells, no evidence of a persistent decrease of cloning ability was observed in the progeny of radiation-exposed human lymphocytes, and no alteration was observed in their sensitivity to a second radiation exposure. Furthermore, the frequency of CA-repeat length variation at three loci was not increased in the progeny of X-irradiated T cells as compared to non-irradiated cells, which indicates that microsatellite instability is not part of the chromosomal instability phenotype in human T-lymphocytes.

We also examined microsatellite instability in human mammary cells transformed to various stages of carcinogenesis, such as normal, growth variant and tumorigenic, using microsatellite marker D5S177 on the chromosome 5 and CYl7 on the Chromosome 10. Microsatellite instabilities were detected in the tumorigenic stage. These results suggest that microsatellite instability may play a role in the progression of tumorigenecity. The cause of the genomic instability has been suggested as abnormalities of DNA-repair systems which may be due to one of the three reasons: 1) alterations of cell cycle regulating genes. 2) mutations in any of the DNA mismatch repair genes, 3) mutation in any of the DNA strand breaks repair genes. No abnormality of these genes and encoded proteins, however was found in the present studies. These studies thus suggest that the microsatellite instability is induced by an alternative mechanism

114	The equivalent square concept for the head scatter factor based on scatter from flattening filter	Biophysics, Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Scattering,Radiation, Technology,Radiologic	The equivalent field relationship between square and circular fields for the head scatter factor was evaluated at the source plane. The method was based on integrating the head scatter parameter for projected shaped fields in the source plane and finding a field that produced the same ratio of head scatter to primary dose on the central axis. A value of sigma/R approximately equal to 0.9 was obtained, where sigma was one-half of the side length of the equivalent square and R was the radius of the circular field. The assumptions were that the equivalent field relationship for head scatter depends primarily on the characteristics of scatter from the flattening filter, and that the differential scatter-to-primary ratio of scatter from the flattening filter decreases linearly with the radius, within the physical radius of the flattening filter. Lam and co-workers showed empirically that the area-to-perimeter ratio formula, when applied to an equivalent square formula at the flattening filter plane, gave an accurate prediction of the head scatter factor. We have analytically investigated the validity of the area-to-perimeter ratio formula. Our results support the fact that the area-to-perimeter ratio formula can also be used as the equivalent field formula for head scatter at the source plane. The equivalent field relationships for wedge and tertiary collimator scatter were also evaluated	
101	A solution for the treatment of small lesions using electron beams from a Saturne linear accelerator with continuous variable trimmers; dosimetrical aspects	Electrons, Humans, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	For treatment of superficial lesions with ionizing radiation, a number of treatment techniques can be used. We use a standardized technique by applying electron beams from GE-MS Saturne-41 linear accelerators; this also works in cases where very small target areas have to be irradiated. In our institute linear accelerators of this type are equipped with continuous variable trimmer systems. Very small electron fields show specific dosimetric problems, which in general necessitates performing measurements for each individual patient. A solution is presented, using a specially designed set of 17 templates, which can be placed on the skin of a patient. The trimmers are set to a predefined field size. Output factors, profiles, percentage depth dose (PDD) and dose outside the template are determined for each combination of template and beam energy. Look-up tables are produced, which can be used by the radiation oncologist and in a monitor unit calculation program	
4362	Is there a need for a revised table of equivalent square fields for the determination of phantom scatter correction factors?	Calibration, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Electrons, Head, Humans, Methods, Models,Theoretical, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation	The use of the British Journal of Radiology (BJR) (supplement 17) tables of equivalent square fields for dose calculations is widespread. A revised version of the supplement was published recently, with a more elaborate discussion, but without changes in data given in these tables (Br. J. Radiol. suppl 25). The tables were generated for use in dose calculations, with relative beam data such as PDD, BSF, PSF, all with d(max) as the reference depth. However, the current philosophy in dose calculational methods is based on quantities defined at a reference depth, d(ref) = 10 cm, on a separation of phantom and head scatter, and on the use of the relative depth-dose or tissue-phantom ratios normalized at d(ref). By using these quantities as a starting point, problems at shallow depths related to the influence of contaminating electrons in the beam can be eliminated. Recently, a comprehensive set of phantom scatter factor data with d(ref) = 10 cm has been published for a set of square field sizes and a wide range of photon beam energies, showing that phantom scatter is a smoothly varying function of field size and quality index. It is not a priori evident that the conventional concept of equivalent squares for rectangular fields is also fully applicable for phantom scatter factors and phantom scatter related quantities at a depth of 10 cm. It was questioned whether or not new tables of equivalent square fields are needed for this purpose. In this paper, new tables have been constructed for four photon beam energies in the range of Co-60 to 25 MV (quality index from 0.572 to 0.783). The small differences between the outcome of these new tables allowed the construction of one averaged table of equivalent square fields. Phantom scatter factors were calculated for rectangular fields based on the use of the BJR table and on the use of the newly constructed tables and the differences were quantified. For Co-60 no improvements could be shown when using the new averaged table, but for beam energies of 6 to 10 MV small improvements of the order of 0.5 to 1.0% were found. For a higher beam energy of 25 MV the improvement is smaller. Deviations resulting from the BJR table are within the limits of accuracy as stated by the authors. Therefore, for clinical use, the continued use of the BJR table of equivalent squares for phantom scatter factors and phantom scatter related quantities of rectangular fields is justified, irrespective of photon beam energy

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies

The purposes of this study is to review results of RS for these large cerebral arteriovenous malformations and to study recent methods which can allow to improve results. PATIENTS: and method. From our series, 112 patients had cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 30 mm or 10 cc at time of the radiosurgery. Revelation mode was hemorrhage in 47%, seizures in 42%, headaches in 16%, and progressive neurological deficits in 7%. Discovery was fortuitous in 2.7% of cases. Before radiosurgery, 57% were embolized, 5% were operated, 4.5% were reirradiated and 1.8% were operated and embolized. Distribution according to Spetzler & Martin's grade was following: 0% in grade I, 12% in grade II, 41% in grade III and 46% in grade IV. No patient was in grade V. RESULTS: Global obliteration rate was 39% for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations. In multivariate analysis, only recovering (positive correlation), and previous embolization (negative correlation) were correlated with obliteration rate. CONCLUSION: Current procedures of radiosurgery allow obliteration in a limited number of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated. Other strategies as fractioned irradiation, multileaf microcollimators with single isocenter, radiosurgery before surgery or radiosurgery with protons should improve obliteration rate.

1421	[Comparison with dose-volume histograms of two conformal irradiation techniques used for the treatment of T2N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer, one with association of photons and protons and another with photons alone]. [French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them	
1536	Induction and disappearance of G2 chromatid breaks in lymphocytes after low doses of low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET fast neutrons	Adult, Anatomy, Chromatids/ge [Genetics], Chromatids/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosome Breakage, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/ae [Adverse Effects], Female, G2 Phase, Gamma Rays, Gamma Rays/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Kinetics, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/cy [Cytology], Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Micronucleus Tests, Models,Biological, Neutrons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance/ge [Genetics], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time	PURPOSE: To determine by means of the G2 assay the number of chromatid breaks induced by low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons, and to compare the kinetics of chromatid break rejoining for radiations of different quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The G2 assay was performed on blood samples of four healthy donors who were irradiated with low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons. In a first set of experiments a dose-response curve for the formation of chromatid breaks was carried out for gamma-rays and neutrons with doses ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 Gy. In a second set of experiments, the kinetics of chromatid break formation and disappearance were investigated after a dose of 0.5 Gy using post-irradiation times ranging between 0.5 and 3.5 h. For the highest dose of 0.5 Gy, the number of isochromatid breaks was also scored. RESULTS: No significant differences in the number of chromatid breaks were observed between low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons for the four donors at any of the doses given. The dose-response curves for the formation of chromatid breaks are linear for both radiation qualities and RBEs = 1 were obtained. Scoring of isochromatid breaks at the highest dose of 0.5 Gy revealed that high-LET neutrons were, however, more effective at inducing isochromatid breaks (RBE = 6.2). The rejoining experiments further showed that the kinetics of disappearance of chromatid breaks following irradiation with low-LET gamma-rays or high-LET neutrons were not significantly different. Half-times of 0.92 h for gamma-rays and 0.84 h for neutrons were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the G2 assay, the results demonstrate that at low doses of irradiation, the induction as well as the disappearance of chromatid breaks is independent of the LET of the radiation qualities used (0.24 keV x microm(-1) 60Co gamma-rays and 20 keV x microm(-1) fast neutrons). As these radiation qualities produce the same initial number of double-strand breaks, the results support the signal model that proposes that chromatid breaks are the result of an exchange process which is triggered by a single double-strand break

Characteristics explored included leaf bank set-up, penumbra width (80-20%) as a function of leaf position, leaf positioning reproducibility, interleaf leakage and leaf transmission. The penumbra values for leaf ends were measured to be between 4.2 and 4.8 mm for various large rectangular fields studied using Kodak X-omat V film at isocentre (1.5 cm deep). Similar films were taken with a standard 1 cm width multi-leaf collimator (MLC) and the penumbra for leaf ends was found to range from 4.3 to 5.2 mm. Other results showed that the rounded leaf tip provided tight control of the penumbra across the leaves' full range of travel. The positioning of the leaves was within a 0.5 mm range when approaching from the same direction. The maximum interleaf leakage was found to be 1.7% and the average leaf transmission less than 1.0%. No major differences were observed in leakage and transmission with changing gantry angle

The value of radiotherapy is discussed, reviewing retrospectively the treatment results obtained in 41 patients irradiated for orbital NHL between 1958 and 1966. All were histologically verified. There were 15 lymphomas of low and nine of high malignancy according to the Kiel classification. Among the 17 remaining patients, 15 cases had been classified as reticulum cell sarcoma and two as lymphosarcoma. Fourteen cases were in stage IE, 19 in stage IIE, and eight in stage IIIE/IVE. After surgical biopsy (n = 25) or resection (n = 5), megavoltage irradiation was delivered in conventional fractionation from 20 Gy up to a total dose of 50 Gy. During the last decade treatment has been based on CT scans and corresponding computer assisted treatment planning. Clinically, complete remission was achieved in 13 out of 14 patients (93%) with stage IE, in 17 out of 19 patients (90%) with stage IIE, and in five out of eight patients (63%) with stage IIIE/IVE. The nonrecurrence rate is 65% (10 out of 14) for stage IE and 75% (13 out of 17) for stage IIE after a mean follow-up time of 36 months. As regards lymphomas of low and high malignancy, the nonrecurrence rate is 89% and 43% respectively. Recurrence (n = 8) and dissemination (n = 6) occurred only twice more than two years after radiotherapy had been discontinued. The incidence of side effects was low. Two patients developed a "dry eye." In two eyes the lens had to be removed because of progressive cataract. Radiotherapy with individual treatment planning based on CT scans is the curative treatment of choice fo localized orbital NHL

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different cell lines and mutation assays were used. Exponentially growing SV40-transformed human fibroblasts were exposed to graded doses of mammography (29 kVp, tungsten anode, 50 microm Rh filter) or conventional X-rays and the frequency of 6-thioguanine-resistent HPRT-deficient mutants was determined. Exponentially growing hamster A(L) cells, which contain a single human chromosome 11 conferring the expression of the human surface protein CD59, were subjected to magnetic cell separation (MACS) in order to remove spontaneous mutants before irradiation with low-filtered 30 kVp (tungsten anode, 0.5 mm Al filter) or conventional X-rays. Fractions of radiation-induced CD59- mutants were quantified by flow-cytometry after immunofluorescence labelling of CD59 proteins. RESULTS: Mammography X-rays were more effective than conventional X-rays at inducing killing of human fibroblasts, whereas 30 kVp X-rays and conventional X-rays were about equally effective at killing Al. cells. Mutant frequencies were linearly related to dose in both mutation assays. An RBE = 2.7 was calculated for the yield of HPRT mutants in human fibroblasts exposed to mammography relative to conventional X-rays and an RBE = 2.4 was obtained for the CD59 mutant frequency in A(L) cells irradiated with low-filtered 30 kVp relative to conventional X-rays. CONCLUSIONS: Both low-filtered 30 kVp and mammography X-rays are mutagenic in mammalian cells in vitro. It is unknown if and how the enhanced mutagenicity of mammography X-rays measured in human cells in vitro translates into breast cancer risk for predisposed women with an enhanced inherited risk for breast cancer. Although the ICRP guidelines attribute the same relative biological effectiveness to all radiations of low LET, including X- and gamma-radiations of all energies for radiobiological protection purposes including the assessment of risks in general terms, they also state that 'for the estimation of the likely consequences of an exposure of a known population, it will sometimes be better to use absorbed dose and specific data relating to the relative biological effectiveness of the radiations concerned and the probability coefficients relating to the exposed population' (ICRP 1991: 32). This latter statement may apply for the population of familial predisposed women. We hope that the presented data on the enhanced mutagenicity of mammography X-rays may stimulate a re-evaluation of the risk assessment of mammography for familial predisposed women. In the meantime, one should be cautious and avoid early and frequent mammography exposure of predisposed women. Alternative examination methods should be applied for these women with an inherited increased risk for breast cancer

The described irradiation technique using special shielding blocks extends the dose distribution till to the region of paraaortic nodes in an extended field. The extended irradiation field is used on the basis of lymphographic examination. In the region of pelvis minor, sufficiently uniform dose distribution is attained with lethal tumor effect.

Although different types of accelerators, photon energies, field sizes and SSD are employed, similar dose distributions along the beam axis have been obtained in both centers. In order to explain this unexpected good agreement, the influence of the geometrical conditions of irradiation on the build-up and depth-dose distribution has been studied in detail for five photon beams (8 MV-25 MV) of three types of accelerators

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 53 intracranial AVMs treated between 1991-1998. HFSR was selected for 26 AVMs with a maximum diameter > or 2.5 cm or at eloquent area. Twenty-seven patients were treated with SRS (18 AVMs < 2.5 cm at non-eloquent area, nine patients who were unfit for prolonged ring-wearing). The most frequent minimum dose (Dmin) was 20 Gy for SRS and 28 Gy for HFSR in four fractions. The mean follow-up duration was 34.6 months for SRS and 35.4 months for HFSR. RESULTS: As a whole, the 3 and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 64 and 92%. Age <20 years old (P=0.02) and a maximum diameter <2 cm were favorable factors (P=0.05). A difference in the distribution of patients was observed in size (> or =2.5 cm or not) (P<0.001) and location (eloquent or not) (P<0.001) between SRS and HFSR due to the treatment selection. However, no significant differences were observed in the actuarial rates of obliteration and transient increased signals with T2-weighted MR images between SRS and HFSR. Radiation necrosis occurred in two patients treated with SRS and in none with HFSR. Intracranial hemorrhage after treatment happened in two treated with SRS and three with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: HFSR appears to be at least as effective as SRS in achieving complete obliteration of intracranial AVM, although its definitive role remains to be investigated

Specific examples of these interface perturbations are encountered during irradiation of body cavities and soft tissue adjacent to bone or metallic implants and irradiation of cells in monolayer on the bottom of culture dishes. Another example is the build-up of CPE at air-tissue interfaces, referred to in radiotherapy as the skin sparing effect. For photon irradiation excess production of secondary electrons in high-Z materials, such as glass, bone or gold, will induce appreciably higher doses and decreased cell survival compared to the equilibrium situation. The energy dissipation of fast neutrons in biological materials occurs through recoil protons, heavy recoil nuclei and products of nuclear reactions. Owing to the large contribution from recoil protons to the neutron kerma, the hydrogen content of the biological material mainly determines the energy deposition. For neutron irradiation of cells in monolayer, CPE can be established or deliberately avoided by mounting tissue-equivalent plastic or carbon discs in front of the cells, respectively. This approach makes it possible to distinguish the biological effects of the low- and high-LET radiation components. [References: 21]

The presence of a three-peak complex was also confirmed near 140 K; spectral emission of this peak consists of two bands whose maxima occur at 290 and 420 nm. TSEE glow curves above 300 K similar to those of TL were observed. The behaviour of TSEE and TL peak 5 following an X ray exposure from 33 to 500 Gy was studied: its intensity is a linear function of air kerma in both cases	
2591	Stereotactic radiosurgery utilizing a linear accelerator	Adolescent, Adult, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	The authors have developed a radiosurgical technique based on multiple arc irradiations. The target is fixed to the rotational isocenter of a Varian 4 MV linear accelerator. The first irradiation is carried out while the radiating source is rotating on a 100-140 degrees arc. The patient is then rotated around a vertical axis passing through the target, and arc irradiations are repeated in different angular positions. By this technique it is possible to obtain very steep dose gradients at the borders of the target volume. High doses are usually delivered in two shots. 47 patients have been treated so far in a clinical trial that started in November 1982. The paper deals with the preliminary results (more than 6 months' follow-up) obtained in patients affected by nonresectable brain tumors and AVMs	
60	[Point of view of the neurosurgeon]. [French]	Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods]	Stereotactic radiosurgery, a term introduced by Leksell, was born more than 40 years ago, but has made great strides for the last 15 years. There is no consensus among neurosurgeons as to the best device (gamma knife, linear accelerator), the treatment doses, and the clinical indications of stereotactic radiosurgery. Therefore, this report is the viewpoint of one neurosurgical team only. In the radiosurgery literature, there is no clear evidence of better results with the gamma-knife or the linear accelerators. With regard to clinical applications, cerebral arteriovenous malformations are the more widely accepted indications of radiosurgery, since a cerebral angiography can confirm the disappearance of the nidus of an arteriovenous malformation treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Usually, small and deep arteriovenous malformations can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery only. Nevertheless, the treatment of the other arteriovenous malformations more often require procedures including one or several of the following treatment methods: microneurosurgery, interventional neuradiology, stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery in acoustic schwannomas, skull base meningiomas, especially those involving the cavernous sinus, brain metastases, and pituitary tumors seem attractive. Contrary to arteriovenous malformations, the lack of criteria for cure requires a long follow-up and carefully controlled trials to confirm the efficiency of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors. On the other hand, experience of stereotactic radiosurgery for astrocytomas and glioblastomas is limited, and few publications are available. Furthermore, because of the infiltrating growth, a major impact of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors is presumably not to be expected. Lastly, a close multidisciplinary approach seems absolutely necessary to define the best indications of stereotactic radiosurgery and to improve its clinical results

To revisit the mechanism of carcinogenesis by Thorotrast (THR), we examined the tissue distribution of THR granules and two-dimensional distribution of radioactivity in the organs of Thorotrastosis patients and studied their spatial relationship to histopathological changes. The high radioactivity in the patients' organ was predominantly derived from decay of Thorium series and showed unique distribution, while the far lower natural radioactivity was mainly from Uranium series decay and fairly evenly distributed. It was found that a large majority of THR granules were phagocytized by macrophages and were embedded in extensive fibrosis. Cancer was rarely in the center of THR deposition but rather at a distance from the deposits. These observations may indicate that the predominant feature of THR deposition is the tissue damage by direct hit of alpha-particles and subsequent fibrosis. The effect of THR resembles action of toxic chemical agents, as several authors have pointed out. We therefore assume that carcinogenesis in Thorotrastosis is a combination of events, such as regeneration of liver tissue after radiation damage, emission of secondary electrons, ionization of the surrounding tissue, and beta- or gamma-ray from daughter nuclei of Thorium (Th). In this context, the role of alpha-particle is important but more intriguing

The lymphocyte count was reduced to approximately 40 per cent at termination of treatment and remained below the pre-treatment level during a follow-up period of 18 months. The relative spontaneous cytotoxicity for 51Cr-labelled K562 cells, derived from a human myeloid leukemia, increased at completion of irradiation and remained elevated during the entire observation period. The relative cytotoxicity against Chang cells, derived from human liver, also seemed to increase but not to the same extent. The increments were probably due to an increased proportion of spontaneously cytotoxic cells bearing Fc-receptors for IgG which were significantly elevated after treatment. It was concluded that the changes differ from those occurring after local irradiation for breast carcinoma. The proportion of lymphoid tissue in relation to the blood volume which is included in the irradiated field may determine the changes of the blood lymphocyte population	
1663	Radiation therapy vault shielding calculational methods when IMRT and TBI procedures contribute	Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Universities, Whole-Body Irradiation/mt [Methods]	The additional intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and total body irradiation (TBI) to conventional treatment clinical treatment procedures can significantly increase the contribution of accelerator head leakage radiation. Previously recommended procedures by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) for vault design, specifically calculations of primary and secondary barrier thicknesses, are not valid when leakage radiation significantly exceeds direct radiation. Use factor distributions are also influenced by IMRT and TBI procedures. Methods are proposed to extend the NCRP barrier design formulas to resolve these problems. The medical accelerator (weekly) workload is separately determined for the direct, leakage, and scatter radiation components. Applications of the formulas to the calculation of primary and secondary barriers are discussed. The addition of IMRT to the shielding design is explored as a function of the fraction patients receiving IMRT and the MU to dose ratio. Secondary barrier thicknesses could be increased by as much as 1 TVL	
606	The potential of proton beam therapy in paediatric cancer. [Review] [64 refs]	Child, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Health Care Costs/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Medulloblastoma/ec [Economics], Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/pc [Prevention & Control], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sweden	A group of Swedish oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that in paediatric cancers, proton beams are of potential importance in 80-100 children annually in Sweden. About 20 of the patients have medulloblastoma. The main purpose is to reduce late sequelae, but these are also increased chances to avoid myelosupression during e.g. concomitant chemo-radiation and to further intensify the chemotherapy.

We report about three cases with a total of seven cavernous angiomas. Clinical features include intracerebral hemorrhage, epileptic seizures and focal neurological signs. Diagnosis is based on typical findings in MRI in combination with an angiography presenting a normal vascular situation or an avascular mass lesion, whereas CT-scan shows nonspecific features. Surgical removal is generally recommended, but could not be done in our cases. A histological verification of a clinically typical diagnosis is not mandatory. Indication for proton beam irradiation still has to be discussed. A definite therapeutical approach will have to consider the natural history in a larger number of cases	
1932	DNA damage induced by radiation of different linear energy transfer: initial fragmentation	Cells,Cultured, DNA Damage, DNA Fragmentation, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Energy Transfer, Helium, Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Nitrogen, Photons, Probability, Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Sweden, Universities	PURPOSE: To investigate DNA fragmentation as a function of linear energy transfer (LET) after exposure to accelerated ions in the LET range 40-225 keV/microm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fragmentation patterns of double-stranded DNA in the range 5 kilobasepairs (kbp) to 5.7 megabasepairs (Mbp) were analysed after irradiation of low-passage GM 5758 normal human fibroblast cells with 60Co-photons, helium ions at 40 keV/microm and high-LET nitrogen ions between 80 and 225 keV/microm. Two separate pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols were used, optimized for separation of 1-6 Mbp and 5 kbp to 1.5 Mbp fragments. RESULTS: An increased probability of formation of short and medium-sized DNA fragments was revealed following high-LET irradiation. The DNA double-strand break (dsb) induction yields were, respectively, 5.8 and 6.9-8.8 x 10(-9) dsb bp(-1) Gy(-1) for 60Co-photons and ions. The ion yields were some 80-110% higher than those calculated according to a conventional approach, disregarding the fragment distributions. For photons, the yield was 13% higher. The corresponding relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of dsb induction was in the range 1.2-1.5. CONCLUSIONS: A significant non-random contribution to the number of dsb after irradiation with high-LET was confirmed by detailed fragment analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The LET had a strong influence on the initial DNA fragment distribution, and hence also on the induction yields measured. However, when the LET was increased to the highest values studied for nitrogen ions, the yield decreased slightly

[Russian]	Humans, Models,Structural, Optics/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/td [Trends], Russia, Time	The medical proton beam on the synchrocyclotron in Gatchina modernized in 1980, is characterized by a simplicity of the beam adjustment that amounts to standard operations, the time of adjustment reduced considerably. The optical scheme ensures a good reproducibility of all the beam parameters from session to session. A large "zone of convergence" makes it possible to select a necessary irradiation field size with the diameter from 3 to 10 mm. A new medical complex with a 2-room premises for irradiation is envisaged on the basis of the "second beam" to expand the medical program. The piercing technique of moving field irradiation with protons at an energy of 1 Gy and the utilization of the convergent beam ensure the ratio of the focal dose to the surface dose 200:1	
48	Effects of changes in stopping-power ratios with field size on electron beam relative output factors	Biophysics, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Technology,Radiologic	Stopping-power ratios are a function of field size and vary with accelerators. To investigate how these variations affect relative output factor measurements made using ion chambers for electron beams, especially for small fields, (L/rho)air(water) is calculated using the Monte Carlo technique for different field sizes, beam energies, and accelerators and is compared to the data in TG-21 or TG-25, which are for mono-energetic broad beams. For very small field sizes defined by cutouts, if the change in (L/rho)air(water) with dmax is ignored (i.e., TG-25 is not carefully followed), there is an overestimate of relative output factors by up to 3%. Ignoring the field-size effect on stopping-power ratio adds an additional overestimate of up to one-half percent, and using mono-energetic stopping-power ratio data instead of realistic beam data gives another error, but in the opposite direction, of up to 0.7%. Due to the cancellation of these latter two errors, following TG-25 with (L/rho)air(water) data for broad mono-energetic beams will give the correct answer for the ROF measurement within 0.4% compared to using (L/rho)air(water) data for which the field-size effect is considered for realistic electron beams	
4120	A method for delivering accurate and uniform radiation dosages to the head and neck with asymmetric collimators and a single isocenter.[see comment]	Film Dosimetry, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lead, Methods, Neck, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Rotation, Time	PURPOSE: To investigate the use of asymmetric collimators and a single isocenter for delivering a uniform, accurate dose of radiation to the head, neck, and supraclavicular lymph nodes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A linear accelerator with a pair of asymmetric collimators is required for this technique. An isocenter was placed at the junction of the lateral head and neck fields and the anterior supraclavicular field. The asymmetric collimators were set longitudinally, by collimator rotation if necessary. The collimators split the radiation beam to all portals. Dose uniformity was measured at the junction with films in solid-water phantoms. RESULTS: Film dosimetry showed a uniform dose at the junction without hot or cold regions. A digital display tolerance of +/- 1.0 mm for a field size maintained an acceptable uniform dose (+/- 5% dose variation) at the junction. The single isocenter and asymmetric collimators reduced field setup time by half. No table rotation was required to match fields. CONCLUSION: The asymmetric collimators lead to easy and accurate patient setup. The absence of the trapezoid effect resulted in the complete coverage of the submandibular and cervical nodes without any hot spots	
3810	Boron neutron capture irradiation: setting up a clinical programme in Nice	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cyclotrons, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Efficiency, Fast Neutrons, France, Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Molecular Structure, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured	Neutron capture irradiation aims to selectively destroy tumor cells using 10B(n,alpha)7Li nuclear reactions produced within themselves. Following the capture reaction, an alpha particle and a, 7Li ion are emitted. Carrying an energy of 2.79 MeV, they destroy all molecular structures along their path close to 10 microns. These captures, used exclusively with a 'slow' neutron irradiation, provide a neutron capture therapy (BNCT). If they are used in addition to a fast neutron beam irradiation, they provide a neutron capture potentiation (NCP). The Centre Antoine-Lacassagne in Nice is actively involved in the European Demonstration Project for BNCT of grade IV glioblastomas (GBM) after surgical excision and BSH administration. Taking into account the preliminary results obtained in Japan, work on an 'epithermal' neutron target compatible with various cyclotron beams is in progress to facilitate further developments of this technique. For NCP, thermalized neutron yield has been measured in phantoms irradiated in the fast neutron beam of the biomedical cyclotron in Nice. A thermal peak appears after 5 cm depth in the tissues, delayed after the fast neutron peak at 1.8 cm depth. Thus, a physical overdosage of 10% may be obtained if 100 ppm of 10B are assumed in the tissues. Our results using CAL 58 GBM cell line demonstrate a dose modification factor (DMF) of 1.19 when 100 ppm of boric acid are added to the growth medium. Thus for the particles, issued from neutron capture, a biological efficiency at least twice that of fast neutrons can be derived. These results, compared with historical data on fast neutron irradiation of glioblastoma, suggest that a therapeutic window may be obtained for GBM

We have examined the effect of oxidized LDL on the cofactor activity for thrombin-dependent protein C activation and expression of thrombomodulin (TM), a cell surface antithrombotic glycoprotein, on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxidized LDL prepared by irradiation of LDL with 254-nm ultraviolet light did not directly affect the cofactor activity of isolated TM. Exposure of the cells to oxidized LDL (25-200 microg/ml), but not native LDL and acetylated LDL, reduced TM cofactor activity in parallel with its antigen levels on the cell surface in an oxidation-, concentration- and time-dependent manner. TM mRNA levels were reduced prior to decrease in TM antigen levels and were 50% of the control levels at 3.0 h after treatment of the cells with oxidized LDL. The apparent half-life time (t1/2 = 2.8 h) of TM mRNA in the oxidized LDL-treated cells, however, did not significantly differ from that (t1/2 = 2.6 h) in the control cells when the cells were coincubated with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a transcriptional inhibitor. Treatment of the cells with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor for the proton pump of the lysosomes, inhibited intracellular degradation of the LDL and prevented down-regulations of the mRNA and the cell surface TM antigen levels caused by oxidized LDL. The inhibitor molecule in oxidized LDL was shown to be a lipid; organic solvent extracts (300 mg/ml cholesterol, an equivalent concentration with lipids in 200 microg/ml oxidized LDL) of oxidized LDL inhibited expression of TM antigen to nearly the same extent as the oxidized LDL, although water extracts did not affect TM expression on the cells. These results suggested that down-regulation of TM on endothelial cells exposed to oxidized LDL resulted from inhibition of its transcription mediated by lysosomal degradation of oxidized LDL and that a lipid component in the LDL could be an active species. A decrease in TM expression on the surface of endothelial cells may contribute to promote thrombosis in atherosclerotic lesions

Various imaging and spectroscopic techniques were applied for measurements carried out prior to conditioning for ABMT/PBSCT and in the course of reconstitution and correlated with clinical and blood chemistry data in these patients. The signal intensity from lumbar bone marrow was determined in T1-weighted and water- and fat-selective MR images. The distribution of the magnetic field was demonstrated by a field-mapping method. Localized proton spectroscopy was performed from volume elements of 2 ml located in the central region of vertebral bodies in order to evaluate the fraction of the water signals, the transverse relaxation times T2 of the signals from water and lipids, and the line widths of the spectral signals. Regions of bone marrow after inflammatory conditions or intensive irradiation are shown to be not involved in marrow reconstitution. Additional information about marrow composition was obtained by the magnetic field mapping and by the line widths in the spectra. Considerable alterations of the amount of paramagnetic hemosiderin were revealed following transplantation. Patients with low water signal and strong local inhomogeneities of the magnetic field in the marrow prior to transplantation had a delayed hematopoietic reconstitution compared with the patients lacking these MR features	
2020	Evaluation of the contribution of capture gamma rays, x-ray leakage, and scatter to the photon dose at the maze door for a high energy medical electron accelerator using a Monte Carlo particle transport code	Biophysics, Gamma Rays, Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Protection/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Universities, X-Rays	A Monte Carlo simulation of the photon dose due to scattered x rays, head leakage photons, and capture gamma rays in the maze of an 18 MeV accelerator facility was carried out. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation were compared with dose measurements made in the maze and also with values calculated using an empirical equation. Agreement within +/-26% was found among the three techniques used to evaluate the capture gamma ray dose. It was found that the empirical equation overestimated the scattered x ray plus head leakage photon dose by a factor as large as 2.9 as compared to the other methods. It was concluded that the photon dose, for mazes greater than 3 m in length, is produced predominately by capture gamma rays	
1252	Relationship between protection and operational quantities in dosimetry of photon external exposure-deficiencies of Hp(10)	Body Burden, Humans, Lead, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Biological, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Occupational Exposure/an [Analysis], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Monitoring/st [Standards], Radiation Protection, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection/st [Standards], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/an [Analysis], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/st [Standards], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Reproducibility of Results, Scattering,Radiation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Statistics as Topic, Time	It is commonly assumed that, for a variety of conditions, the E/Hp(10) conversion coefficient is below unity, i.e., Hp(10) can be used as a conservative surrogate of effective dose. The validity of this assumption was checked by Monte Carlo simulation of E and Hp(10) as determined by a practical dosemeter. The calculations concerned irradiation by parallel photon beams with directions varying within a 4pi solid angle and energy ranging from 50 keV to 1 MeV. Observed dependences of conversion coefficients on irradiation geometry, photon energy and dosemeter position demonstrate that in strongly anisotropic radiation fields straightforward application of Hp(10) for assessment of effective dose may lead to significant underestimation of the latter. For photon energy of 80 keV this underestimation may be up to 16-fold. For simulation of real life situations, irradiation by photons coming within broad cones (with solid angle pi) was considered. It was found that even for this irradiation geometry, E/Hp(10) may be as high as 4.3. At the same time, for radiation coming from the frontal hemisphere, the values of the conversion coefficient for a typically positioned (i.e., the left chest pocket) personal dosemeter do not exceed unity. The conclusion was reached that prior to application of Hp(10) as a surrogate of effective dose, the information regarding angular distribution of radiation fields must be taken into account

They emphasize the role of promotion, in particular that associated with cell proliferation. There is therefore a qualitative difference between high doses of genotoxic agents which provoke cell death and a compensatory increase in cell division, and low doses which do not. During the promotion phase, human data demonstrate the importance of induced genetic instability and defects in apoptosis as well as that of cell immortalization which play a main role for the accumulation in a cell genome of several specific lesions. Carcinogenesis is a complex process in which initial mutations do not appear to be a limiting or crucial step. This view is supported by the paramount influence of age on the induction by radiation of thyroid and breast cancer. It is also compatible with practical thresholds observed in subjects whose bones or liver were exposed to alpha-emitters, as well as with the curvilinearity in the leukemia incidence dose-response in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The linear no threshold model assumes that: 1) the probability of DNA lesion repair is constant whatever the dose and, hence, the number of lesions provoked in the same cell and the surrounding cells; 2) the probability for a damaged cell to evolve toward an invasive cancer is not influenced by the possible promotional effect of further irradiation or induced tissue proliferation, nor the control exerted by surrounding cells. These assumptions deserve a critical analysis. [References: 80]

Our measurements show that: (1) wedge factors are within 2% of unity, (2) percentage depth doses are within 1% of open beam data, and (3) wedged beam profiles can be modeled similarly to a physical wedge and follow a well defined equation to facilitate modeling of an arbitrary wedge angle. The gantry angle dependence of wedge profiles is similar to open beam profiles. The output of wedged fields is linear with delivered monitor units within 1%. Quality assurance results indicate the wedge profiles are very stable over time. Day to day variations of two points measured along the wedge gradient direction are within 1.5%	
1572	Intensity and energy modulated radiotherapy with proton beams: variables affecting optimal prostate plan	Algorithms, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Normal Distribution, Physics, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	Inverse planning for intensity- and energy-modulated radiotherapy (IEMRT) with proton beams involves the selection of (i) the relative importance factors to control the relative importance of the target and sensitive structures, (ii) an appropriate energy resolution to achieve an acceptable depth modulation, (iii) an appropriate beamlet width to modulate the beam laterally, and (iv) a sufficient number of beams and their orientations. In this article we investigate the influence of these variables on the optimized dose distribution of a simulated prostate cancer IEMRT treatment. Good dose conformation for this prostate case was achieved using a constellation of I factors for the target, rectum, bladder, and normal tissues of 500, 50, 15, and 1, respectively. It was found that for an active beam delivery system, the energy resolution should be selected on the basis of the incident beams' energy spread (sigmaE) and the appropriate energy resolution varied from 1 MeV at sigmaE = 0.0 to 5 MeV at sigmaE= 2.0 MeV. For a passive beam delivery system the value of the appropriate depth resolution for inverse planning may not be critical as long as the value chosen is at least equal to one-half the FWHM of the primary beam Bragg peak. Results indicate that the dose grid element dimension should be equal to or no less than 70% of the beamlet width. For this prostate case, we found that a maximum of three to four beam ports is required since there was no significant advantage to using a larger number of beams. However for a small number (< or = 4) of beams the selection of beam orientations, while having only a minor effect on target coverage, strongly influenced the sensitive structure sparing and normal tissue integral dose

In particular, it is unclear whether dose in patient-specific fields can be determined more reliably with or without the presence of the patient-specific range compensator. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the reliability of two methods for measuring dose per monitor unit (DIMU) values for small-field treatment portals: one with the range compensator and one without the range compensator. A Monte Carlo model of the Proton Therapy Center-Houston double-scattering nozzle was created, and estimates of D/MU values were obtained from 14 simulated treatments of a simple geometric patient model. Field-specific D/MU calibration measurements were simulated with a dosimeter in a water phantom with and without the range compensator. D/MU values from the simulated calibration measurements were compared with D/MU values from the corresponding treatment simulation in the patient model. To evaluate the reliability of the calibration measurements, six metrics and four figures of merit were defined to characterize accuracy, uncertainty, the standard deviations of accuracy and uncertainty, worst agreement, and maximum uncertainty. Measuring D/MU without the range compensator provided superior results for five of the six metrics and for all four figures of merit. The two techniques yielded different results primarily because of high-dose gradient regions introduced into the water phantom when the range compensator was present. Estimated uncertainties (approximately 1 mm) in the position of the dosimeter in these regions resulted in large uncertainties and high variability in D/MU values. When the range compensator was absent, these gradients were minimized and D/MU values were less sensitive to dosimeter positioning errors. We conclude that measuring D/MU without the range compensator present provides more reliable results than measuring it with the range compensator in place

To measure the peripheral dose profiles and point doses for the applicator, a solid water phantom was used with calibrated Kodak TL films. Peak dose spot was observed in the 4 MeV beam outside the applicator. The peripheral dose peak was very small in the 6 MeV beam and was ignorable at higher energies. Using the 10 x 10 cm(2) cutout and applicator, the dose peak for the 4 MeV beam was about 12 cm away from the field central beam axis (CAX) and the peripheral dose profiles did not change with depths measured at 0.2, 0.5 and 1 cm. The peripheral doses and profiles were further measured by varying the angle of obliquity, cutout and applicator size for the 4 MeV beam. The local peak dose was increased with about 3% per degree angle of obliquity, and was about 1% of the prescribed dose (angle of obliquity equals zero) at 1 cm depth in the phantom using the 10 x 10 cm(2) cutout and applicator. The peak dose position was also shifted 7 mm towards the CAX when the angle of obliquity was increased from 0 to 15 degrees

A model of the treatment head includes the major geometric structure within the beam path. The model was used to calculate the energy spectra of the photon beam, percentage depth dose and the dose profiles. The accuracy of the calculated results is examined by comparing them with the measured dose distributions for the two machines. The computed and measured depth dose curves agree to within 2% for all the depths beyond the build-up region for both treatment machines. The calculations agree to within 2% of the measured profiles within the 100-50% dose level. It has been found that the MCNPX code is an effective tool for simulating the clinical photon beam	
3339	A new sigmoidal function describing the small field dose profile data from a linear accelerator	Biometry, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities	Dose profile data from small circular fields have been used in treatment dose planning for stereotactic radiosurgery. Generally, a two-dimensional interpolation of the measured beam profiles from circular collimators is used to calculate the dose at any axial depth and radial distance from the central axis. Instead, the dose profile data can be transformed into a sigmoidal form. A new three parameter sigmoidal function was developed to fit the transformed (sigmoidal) dose profile data. The values of the three estimated parameters were found to follow either linearly or exponentially as a function of axial depth. Thus, instead of linear interpolation, these formulas can be used to calculate dose at any axial depth and radial distance from the central axis for circular collimators of various diameters. This new sigmoidal function provides another formula to describe dose profile data from circular collimator of small fields

The risk of losing this level of protection is substantially reduced if two or more dose monitoring systems are used which are mechanically and electrically independent in design. This paper describes the installation of an independent radiation monitor in a dual-mode, computer-controlled accelerator with a moveable monitor chamber. The added device is fixed in the beam path, is capable of monitoring each beam pulse, and is capable of terminating irradiation within the pulse repetition period if any measured pulse is unacceptably high

This technique uses the spectral vectorial algebra formalism. The resolution has previously been tested on a 12 MV photon beam. To extend and to test the validity of the results to the entire radiotherapy energy range, we have performed the method on photon beams with nominal energies of 6, 12, 15, and 25 MV. The influence on the 6 MV spectrum of a 60 degrees built-in wedge has also been investigated to test the sensitivity of the method and the results are reported. To validate our reconstructed spectra, dosimetric quantities such as tissue phantom ratios (TPR), water-to-air stopping power ratios (S/p) air water, and quality indexes TPR 10 (20) have been calculated. The results show good agreement between the measured and calculated data. Mean mass energy absorption coefficient ratios for different materials have also been computed and compared to data published recently and the results are very close (within +/- 0.5%). Primary depth dose functions in water have also been computed to deduce primary dose attenuation coefficients

In case of densely ionizing radiation, the ions can produce breaks of both cords of DNA thus causing the death of the cell (alpha effect). Lower ion densities will produce only slight damages which are possibly lethal but can be partly repaired (beta effect). If the cell parameters are known (L. Cohen 1983), the number of surviving cells after an irradiation can be calculated. The surviving lung cells and tumor cells (squamous cell carcinoma) have been calculated for a pulmonary irradiation with 30 MeV electrons and 200 keV X-rays (single doses of 2 and 5 Gy), respectively. The electron irradiation with single doses of 5 Gy turned out to be the most favorable therapy sparing the greatest number of lung cells and reducing the tumor cells in the most effective way (down to 1.6 x 10(-10))

The physical processes by which radiation interacts with the environment are quite well defined. Although these processes differ depending upon the nature (either electromagnetic or particulate) of the primary radiation, the ultimate result is the production in the medium of high-speed, secondary charged particles. Some of the energy of these particles is absorbed by the medium, while a portion may be lost as bremsstrahlung. The energy that is absorbed produces excitation and ionization, which can be disruptive to biological systems. The effects produced by ionizing radiations at the biochemical, cellular, and organ level are less well defined. Nevertheless, available data indicate that certain generalizations are possible. For example, given the ubiquitous nature of water in tissues, macromolecules, regardless of their structural types, tend to serve as acceptors of the energy and products of water radiolysis. However, a deeper insight into the consequences of irradiation requires an understanding of the interplay of such parameters as the type and energy of the radiation, and the dose and rate of its application. Furthermore, at the cellular level, the type and age of the irradiated cells, the concentration of oxygen in their environment, and their cell-cycle phase are all important factors in determining the consequences of irradiation.

1662	Shielding assessment of a mobile electron accelerator for intraoperative radiotherapy	Electrons, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant/is [Instrumentation], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Universities	A new approach to intraoperative radiotherapy makes use of a mobile electron linear accelerator delivering therapeutic radiation doses in an operating room suite. This unconventional technology has raised questions concerning protection for personnel and the necessity of shielding the adjoining areas. In this study, the leakage and scatter radiation from the mobile electron accelerator is measured and characterized in a series of spherical projections. An analysis is performed to determine the need for shielding or, alternatively, patient-based load restrictions in the operating room. This investigation provides a resource to assess shielding and/or patient load restrictions for any facility performing intraoperative radiotherapy with a similar unit. The data presented indicates that the mobile electron accelerator may be operated in an area with little or no shielding under nominal patient load expectations

585	Radiation-induced bystander and other non-targeted effects: novel intervention points in cancer therapy?. [Review] [87 refs]	Animals, Apoptosis, Apoptosis/re [Radiation Effects], Bystander Effect, Cell Line, DNA Damage, Genomic Instability, Homeostasis, Humans, Knowledge, Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Occupational Exposure, Ontario, Physics, Radiation, Research, Signal Transduction	A major problem in the search for new cancer drug targets is that the drugs are often toxic to normal tissues and require high doses to kill tumor cells. Therefore cellular targets which appear to involve low dose responses to cancer therapy are especially interesting since they could selectively target normal tissues which are not targeted by the treatment and thus may be responsible for unpleasant side effects or may be amenable to exploitation in order to improve the therapeutic ratio. One such target, which is the subject of this review, is radiation-induced bystander effects [RIBE], which result in the observation of radiation like responses in cells which have not been irradiated. RIBE is a novel phenomenon which indicates that at low doses, cell signaling is more important than direct DNA damage. Historically, DNA has always been considered to be the target for radiation therapy. The growing realization that signaling is important opens up several important therapeutic strategies which will be discussed in this review. RIBE appears to be the result of a generalized stress response in tissues or cells which is expressed at the level of the tissue, organ or organism rather than at the level of the individual cell. The signals may be produced by all exposed cells, but the response may require a quorum of cells in order to be expressed. The major response involving low LET (x- or gamma-ray) radiation exposure discussed in the existing literature is a death response. This has many characteristics of apoptosis but may be detected in cell lines without p53 expression, although the death response is suppressed in many tumor cell lines. While a death response in unirradiated normal cells around a tumor might appear to be adverse, it can in fact be protective and remove damaged cells from the population. If harnessed correctly, it could lead to the development of new drugs aimed not at tissue destruction but at enabling homeostatic mechanisms to control tumor expansion. In this scenario, the level of harmful or beneficial response will be related to the background damage, carried by the cell population, and the genetic programme determining response to damage. This focus may be important when attempting to predict the consequences of mixed therapies involving radiation and other cytotoxic agents. In this review, our current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the induction of bystander effects by ionizing radiation is reviewed, and the question of how bystander effects may be harnessed to produce a new generation of anti-cancer drugs aimed at stabilization of tissue homeostasis rather than tissue destruction is considered.

Mid-arc depth-doses were measured for 0 degrees and 90 degrees arcs using 12 and 15 cm radius cylindrical water phantoms. Calculated depth-doses for the 90 degrees arced beams in the build-up region were as much as 3% less than measured values; the maximum dose was similar in magnitude but at a greater depth; and the therapeutic depth, R80, was 2-4 mm deeper. Calculated values of output (dose per monitor unit) at the depth of the maximum calculated dose were compared with measured values; for arcs ranging from 0-90 degrees, 12 and 15 cm radius water phantoms, and collimator widths of 4, 5 and 6 cm, results showed differences as great as 7%. Isodose countours for a 90 degrees arc were also measured in a 15 cm radius PMMA phantom. At the depth of maximum dose the algorithm predicted doses in the penumbral regions, both with and without collimation, which agreed within a few per cent of measured values. The largest discrepancies were 5%, which occurred in the penumbral portion of the depth-dose fall-off region. Differences between measurement and calculation are not believed to be clinically significant and are believed to be primarily due to the fact that the algorithm models neither large-angle scattering nor the effects of range straggling on the pencil-beam dose distribution

The treatment methods include enucleation and other techniques designed to preserve the eye, such as local resection, plaque radiotherapy, charged particle radiotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and thermotherapy. Plaque radiotherapy and charged particle radiotherapy provide tumor control and patient survival comparable with enucleation. Plaque radiotherapy may be associated with fewer anterior segment complications, but the posterior segment complications appear to be similar using either plaque radiotherapy or charged particle radiotherapy. Thermotherapy is emerging as an important adjuvant treatment to maintain control of uveal melanoma after radiotherapy. [References: 79]

Recently, we found that the accumulation of iNOS in wtp53 celIs was induced by chronic irradiation with gamma rays followed by acute irradiation with X-rays, but not by each one, resulting in an increase in nitrite concentrations of medium. It is suggested that the accumulation of iNOS may be due to the depression of acute irradiation-induced p53 functions by pre-chronic irradiation. In addition, we found that the radiosensitivity of wtp53 cells against acute irradiation with X-rays was reduced after chronic irradiation with gamma rays. This reduction of radiosensitivity of wtp53 cells was nearly completely suppressed by the addition of NO scavenger, carboxy-PTIO to the medium. This reduction of radiosensitivity of wtp53 cells is just radiation-induced adaptive response, suggesting that NO-mediated bystander effect may considerably contribute to adaptive response induced by radiation

The human melanoma cell line A375, which bears wild-type p53 gene status, was used, as well as the transfectant A375 cells (A375/p53) with adenoviral vector containing the wild-type p53 gene. We exposed these cells to X-rays and to accelerated carbon-ion (C-) beams. Cellular sensitivities were determined by using clonogenic assay. Apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths were determined morphologically by dual staining (acridine orange and ethidium bromide) using fluorescence microscopy. We discovered that (1) there was no significant difference in survival fraction between A375 cells and A375/p53 cells irradiated by C-beams with greater than 32 KeV/microm LET, (2) although apoptosis in the two kinds of cells increased in an LET-dependent manner, exogenous wild-type P53 induced cell apoptosis efficiently in A375/p53 relative to A375 cells with X-rays or high-LET irradiation, and (3) by high-LET irradiation, the number of necrosis in A375 cells increased significantly (P < 0.05) in comparison with A375/p53 cells. These results indicate that in high-LET irradiation apoptosis induction is p53 dependent partly and exogenous wild-type P53 plays an important role in modulating cell death type, although there was no significant difference in cellular radiosensitivities. Our observation in the study offers the potential application of high-LET radiation combined with p53 in the management of human patients with melanoma	
3452	Optimized beam planning for linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery	Boston, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Brain Stem, Eye, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Software	PURPOSE: Current treatment planning for linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy is a lengthy and iterative procedure. The planner has to manually select the beam arcs and carefully consider many different selections to ensure target volume coverage while sparing dose to critical organs. In this article we report an optimization procedure that can automatically select the beam arcs based on geometric and dosimetric analysis of the treatment parameters. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The optimization problem is introduced by using a Beam's Eye View (BEV) map where a pattern of lines represents a beam arc combination for a treatment plan. The collection of all possible treatment plans is described by using the concept of phase space where each point corresponds to a particular configuration of the system under consideration, and in this case, a particular beam arc combination. A geometric reduction of the phase space is performed by excluding static beam ports that irradiate too much critical organs and too little target volume. The phase space is further reduced by excluding beam arc combinations that do not comply with treatment convenience considerations and established planning experiences. These reductions significantly reduces the number of beam arc combinations to be considered and thus dramatically simplifies the computational complexity. The method of simulated annealing is then used to the reduced phase space to select the set of beam arcs that provides the best surface dose distribution for the target volume. The optimization procedure is applied to a radiosurgery case to compare the optimized beam arcs with the previously manually planned beam arcs. The procedure is also applied to 10 randomly selected cases for a comparison in terms of tissue-volume ratio calculations. RESULTS: The system is a highly automated beam arc planning tool for stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy. Its interactive nature allows the planner to rapidly consider many treatment plans to search for the best option. For the case presented, it is shown that the optimized beams substantially reduce the dose to the postrema. The tissue-volume ratio calculations demonstrate that the optimization often produces clinically superior treatment plans than the manual beam planning method. CONCLUSIONS: Our method of phase space reduction proves to be very useful in approaching the complex problem of treatment planning optimization. Not only does it substantially reduce the number of beam arcs that need to be considered, but it also simplifies the evaluation of the beam arc options. Both of these greatly reduce the computational complexity of the optimization and make the procedure fast and efficient. Moreover, the reduction of phase space adds another layer of interaction between the user and the beam selection procedure, so that the optimization process is well controlled and thus very effective

The image guidance system includes a kilovoltage X-ray imaging source and amorphous silica detectors. The radiation delivery device is a mobile X-band linear accelerator mounted onto a robotic arm. Through a highly complex interplay between the image guidance system, an automated couch, and the high-speed linear accelerator, near real-time tracking of the target is achieved. The Cyberknife gained Federal Drug Administration clearance in the United States in 2001 for treatment of tumors "anywhere in the body where radiation treatment is indicated." Because the Cyberknife system does not rely on rigid fixation of a stereotactic frame, tumors outside of the intracranial compartment, even those tumors that move with respiration can be treated with a similar degree of ease as intracranial targets. A description of the Cyberknife technology and a review of some of the current intracranial and extracranial applications are detailed herein

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigated 106 tumors (27 ciliary body melanomas and 79 choroidal-ciliary melanomas) of patients treated between June 1983 and April 1998. Seventy-two patients were treated with 106-ruthenium applicators and 34 were treated with proton therapy. Some large tumors or recurrences required a second treatment. The mean follow-up period was 91 months. RESULTS: The mean tumor sizes before treatment were 6,6mm for melanoma thickness and 10.3mm for mean largest basal melanoma diameters (LTD). Of the patients studied, 71% were still alive at 5 years, 35% had metastasis and 27.7% developed recurrences. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for melanoma-related death were LTD greater than 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis, and choroidal-ciliary location. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With 71% of patients still alive at 5 years, this review shows that melanomas involving the ciliary body do not seem less severe than more posterior uveal tumors. Because of size differences between ciliary body melanomas and choroidal-ciliary melanomas, we cannot come to the conclusion that choroidal-ciliary melanomas have a poorer prognosis than ciliary body melanomas. Largest tumor diameter over 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, and macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis are important risk factors for melanoma-related death, as shown by the multivariate analysis	
1766	A tool to measure radiotherapy complexity and workload: derivation from the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) concept.[see comment]	Efficiency,Organizational, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Time, Time Management, Workload	Radiotherapy workload is poorly represented by simple parameters of patients, fractions or fields treated because these do not contain any measure of treatment complexity. However, complexity is increasing and there is an urgent need to quantify this. We have evaluated the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) model as a measure of radiotherapy workload and complexity. Radiotherapy treatment times, from the patient entering to exiting the treatment room maze, were measured for 1298 treatment sessions on 269 patients. The data were used to assess the original model and derive three new models for predicting treatment duration. The most complicated, the 'Addenbrooke's complex model', contained two additional predictor variables, including 'site/technique', in a linear additive form. Before the study, the department used a standard treatment appointment time of 10 minutes. However, 50% of the measured treatments took longer than 10 minutes, (mean 10.9). Summed over the working day, this discrepancy indicates that a standard 10-minute appointment is a poor basis for scheduling radiotherapy. The original BTE model was effective in predicting treatment times, although this was improved by refinement of the model. The Addenbrooke's complex model correctly predicted 70% of treatment times to within 2 minutes (55% for the original BTE model), 80% to within 2.5 minutes and 95% to within 4.7 minutes. The percentage of the variation in observed times accounted for by the model is 59.4%. The models can represent radiotherapy complexity, can improve scheduling on linear accelerators, and are likely to be applicable to other departments. They are thus tools to assess the impact of changes in complexity from new techniques, trial protocols (e.g. the Medical Research Council prostate radiotherapy trial RTO1), and possible time saving from advanced technology such as multileaf collimators (MLCs) or automated machine set-up. The replacement of manually-lifted shielding blocks by MLCs should save 1.1-1.5 minutes for a three- or four-field pelvic plan (i.e. 12%-13%). The models could also be used to aid planning for future linear accelerator provision and for costing radiotherapy treatment

The main causes of failure remain linked to locoregional recurrences, which are due to incomplete eradication of clonogenic cells. Conventional radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy are currently carried out at their extreme possibilities due to their intrinsic limitation--namely the impossibility to generate concave dose distributions without compromising tumor irradiation. Approximately a third of patients treated with radiotherapy and most head and neck cancer cases present concave shapes of the target volumes. With the advent of intensity modulated radiation therapy--clinically available for only few years--head and neck patients can now benefit from strategies based on highly conformal techniques. It is possible to exploit efficiently dose-escalation protocols to increase probabilities to eradicate clonogens, to reduce overall treatment time, to control repopulation problems and to keep as low as reasonably necessary the irradiation of healthy tissues minimizing acute and late complications. Today, both planning and clinical studies demonstrate these advantages but larger controlled trials are necessary to assess the true potentialities of techniques based on intensity modulation for head and neck cancers. In a speculative view, proton therapy, possibly with intensity modulation, or light ion therapy should be considered for selected cases or for reirradiation due to their higher biological efficacy and their degree of dose-conformation to target volumes.

3120	10 MV x-ray SMRs obtained using zero-area S(p) correction factors derived by means of the Bjarngard-Petti method	Electrons, Humans, Japan, Mathematics, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Universities, Water, X-Rays	Based on the Khan concept, a new set of 10 MV x-ray scatter-maximum ratios (SMRs) has been produced. THese new SMRs reflect no electron contamination and are parametrized. A method has been developed for determining the minimum field size with lateral CPE (charged particle equilibrium) at the field centre. It is found that for 10 MV x-rays the minimum square field with lateral CPE at large depths on the central axis in water is 3.5 x 3.5 cm2. The zero-area phantom scatter correction factor (S(p)) is derived using the Bjarngard-Petti method. It is found that the effect of electron contamination is to reduce the zero-area Sp correction factor

The combination of capabilities available with heavy charged particles makes for a desirable therapeutic option that offers the opportunity for tumor ablation while preserving normal tissue function, with obvious implications for quality of life.

This additional third phase in PCr hydrolysis, is preceded by a common biphasic pattern (first fast then slow) in PCr use. The NMR spectra, as localized by a surface coil and improved by proton irradiation, were collected at a time resolution of 16 s. Mean rates of PCr hydrolysis during exercise were -0.44 +/- 0.19% s(-1), -0.07 +/- 0.04% s(-1), and -0.29 +/- 0.10% s(-1) for the three successive phases. The increased rate of PCr hydrolysis, and also the loss of fine force control evident in the force records are consistent with increased involvement of large, fast-fatiguable units later in the contraction.

4613	[Advancement of treatment for prostate cancer]. [Review] [17 refs] [Japanese]	Aging, Brachytherapy, Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Combined Modality Therapy, Endpoint Determination, Europe, Humans, Japan, Male, Patients, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatectomy, Prostatectomy/mt [Methods], Prostatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Transurethral Resection of Prostate, Universities	The number of prostate cancer patients is rapidly increasing in Japan, as aging people are more common and the lifestyle is more westernized. Another reason is that prostate specific antigen (PSA) is prevalent and PSA test can detect organ-confined prostate cancer in the early stage. In the past, endocrine therapy was the main treatment modality since many prostate cancer patients were diagnosed in the advanced stage. However, endocrine therapy is not suitable for young patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. Surgery and radiation therapy are becoming standard therapy for these patients. Although retropubic radical prostatectomy is widely performed,urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction are still problems. Other approaches such as laparoscopic prostatectomy, portless endoscopic prostatectomy and perineal prostatectomy are also performed. Radiation therapy is commonly used for organ-confined prostate cancer in Europe and the U.S.A. The advancement in computer technology has made it possible to accumulate enough radiation dose to target without damaging the surrounding organs (3 D conformal, intensity-modulated radiotherapy). Heavy ion particle radiotherapy is also attempted in some institutes. Moreover, brachytherapy can be another choice in radiation therapy. In Japan, only high-dose brachytherapy with (192)Ir has been performed. In July 2003, permanent seed brachytherapy with (121)I was legally approved in Japan, and more organ-confined prostate cancer patients are expected to undergo this treatment. There are several treatment modalities for organ-confined prostate cancer patients these days. Therefore, not only tumor grade and stage, but also patients'lifestyle and thought should be considered in determining treatment. [References: 17]

[Russian]	Adolescent, Child, Cushing Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Time Factors, X-Ray Therapy	Forty children with Icenko-Cushing's disease were subjected to radiotherapy. Radiation of the pituitary with a proton beam in a dose of 70-100 Gy (7000-10000 rad) performed according to the indicated technique appeared highly effective. It was not associated with local or total radiation injuries and was safe. X-ray therapy conducted according to the fractionally intensive technique in a dose of 3000-3500 rad was less effective and produced disease relapses more frequently as compared with proton therapy

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. If an estimated 1% of the palliative treatments can be administered by protons with substantial benefits to the patient, almost 100 patients per year in Sweden would be eligible. It is further estimated that around 150 patients per year in need of reirradiation would benefit from radiation with protons compared to photons. [References: 15]	
783	The influence of beam model differences in the comparison of dose calculation algorithms for lung cancer treatment planning	Algorithms, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Software, Water	In this study, we show that beam model differences play an important role in the comparison of does calculated with various algorithms for lung cancer treatment planning. These differences may impact the accurate correlation of dose with clinical outcome. To accomplish this, we modified the beam model penumbral parameters in an equivalent path length (EPL) algorithm and subsequently compared the EPL doses with those generated with Monte Carlo (MC). A single AP beam was used for beam fitting. Two different beam models were generated for EPL calculations: (1) initial beam model (init_fit) and (2) optimized beam model (best_fit) , with parameters optimized to produce the best agreement with MC calculated profiles at several depths in a water phantom. For the 6 MV, AP beam, EPL(init_fit) calculations were on average within 2%/2 mm (1.4 mm max.) agreement with MC; the agreement for EPL(best_fit) was 2%/1.0 mm (1.3 mm max.) for EPL(best_fit). Treatment planning was performed using a realistic lung phantom using 6 and 15 MV photons. In all homogeneous phantom plans, EPL(best_fit) calculations were in better agreement with MC. In the heterogeneous 6 MV plan, differences between EPL(best_fit and init_fit) and MC were significant for the tumour. The EPL(init_fit), unlike the EPL(best_fit) calculation, showed large differences in the lung relative to MC. For the 15 MV heterogeneous plan, clinically important differences were found between EPL(best_fit or init_fit) and MC for tumour and lung, suggesting that the algorithmic difference in inhomogeneous cases, differences between EPL(best_fit) and MC for lung tissues were smaller compared to those between EPL(init_fit) and MC. Although the extent to which beam model differences impact the dose comparisons will be dependent upon beam parameters (orientation, field size and energy), and the size and location of the tumour, this study shows that failing to correctly account for beam model differences will lead to biased comparisons between dose algorithms. This may ultimately hinder our ability to accurately correlate dose with clinical outcome	
270	Effects of heavy ions and energetic protons on normal human fibroblasts	Bystander Effect/ge [Genetics], Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Fibroblasts/ul [Ultrastructure], Heavy Ions, Heavy Ions/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Ions, Micronuclei,Chromosome-Defective/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, X-Rays	At the low particle fluences of radiation to which astronauts are exposed in space, "non-targeted" effects such as the bystander response may have increased significance. The radiation-induced bystander effect is the occurrence of biological responses in unirradiated cells near to or sharing medium with cells traversed by radiation. The objectives of this study were to establish the responses of AG01522 diploid human fibroblasts after exposure to several heavy ions and energetic protons, as compared to X-rays, and to obtain initial information on the bystander effect in terms of cell clonogenic survival after Fe ion irradiation. Using a clonogenic survival assay, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values at 10% survival were 2.5, 2.3, 1.0 and 1.2 for 1 GeV/amu Fe, 1 GeV/amu Ti, 290 MeV/amu C and 1 GeV/amu protons, respectively, compared to 250 kVp X-rays. For induction of micronuclei (MN), compared to the low LET protons, Fe and Ti are very effective inducers of damage, although C ions are similar to protons. Using a transwell insert system in which irradiated and unirradiated bystander cells share medium but are not touching each other, it was found that clonogenic survival in unirradiated bystander cells was decreased when irradiated cells were exposed to Fe ions or X-rays. The magnitude of the decrease in bystander survival was similar with both radiation types, reaching a plateau of about 80% survival at doses of about 0.5 Gy or larger

Special features of the facility like a non-contact electron applicator system with television monitoring, table-top trolley, which is used also during irradiation, are explained in detail. Measured isodose curves for all tubes and all electron energies serve for the radiotherapist as criteria for decision on tube size and electron energy selection during surgical operation. The influence of misalignments of the tube on dose distributions is investigated. Limit values of alignment tolerances are deduced. Daily constancy tests for monitor calibration, electron energy, and tube alignment system are to be performed for quality assurance. Tables of the planned and realized treatments and of a representative time schedule of an IORT give a survey on the indications and the necessary time effort and staff. Completion of the set of tubes as well as optimization of the tube fixation accessory and of the table-top trolley are main subjects for future developments	
1912	Risk factors for radiation maculopathy and papillopathy after intraocular irradiation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Eye, Female, Humans, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Optic Disk/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Risk, Risk Factors, Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To evaluate rates of occurrence and risk factors for radiation maculopathy and radiation papillopathy in patients with choroidal melanoma at high risk for these complications. DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

At 37.80 Gy, fields were reduced and a final tumor dose of 59.40 Gy in 33 fractions given in three and a half weeks. Fifty-six percent of patients had complete resolution of tumor; the overall local control rate was 52% with an average follow-up of 12.5 months. Actuarial survival was 74% at 12 months and 50% at 24 months. Disease-free survival was 48% at 12 months and 32% at 24 months. Acute complications were common, but late complications were rare, two cases of asymptomatic subcutaneous fibrosis. Radiation therapy with accelerated fractionation shows promise of improving the therapeutic ratio

Transmembrane alpha-lipoic acid reduction by Leishmania was not inhibited by mitochondrial inhibitors as azide, cyanide, rotenone or antimycin A, but responded to hemin, modifiers of sulphhydryl groups and inhibitor of glycolysis. The protonophores carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone and 2,4-dinitrophenol showed inhibition of alpha-lipoic acid reduction. This transmembrane redox system differs from that of mammalian cells in respect to its sensitivity of UV irradiation and stimulation by diphenylamine. Thus a naphthoquinone coenzyme appears to be involved in alpha-lipoic acid reduction by Leishmania cells

The calibration of solid state detectors for proton beams is not a solved problem especially for ophthalmologic proton beams, where these detectors present a LET-dependent signal. In this work a PTW diamond detector has been selected because of its good signal reproducibility (0.3%) and stable response with accumulated dose. A method that takes into account the LET dependence of the diamond detector signal, at 62 MeV proton beam, is here proposed. In particular an empirical correction factor, kDD(Eo) (Rres), has been determined as a function of the residual range quality index, to correct the diamond detector signal for a proton beam of incident effective energy E0= 62 MeV. A dedicated software allows us to use the diamond detector as an on-line reference dosimeter, where an ionization chamber may be difficult to use, or for periodic quality control procedures. The article also reports a comparison between the signal dependence on proton energy of silicon, diamond, and radiochromic film detectors	
3316	Telescopic measurements of backscattered radiation from secondary collimator jaws to a beam monitor chamber using a pair of slits	Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Scattering,Radiation, Universities, X-Rays	A contribution to field-size dependent output by backscattered radiation (BSR) from secondary collimator jaws to a beam monitor chamber of a linear accelerator was measured with a Farmer ionization chamber, positioned 200 cm from the source behind a low-melting-point alloy slab with a 10-cm wide slit. Another slit was positioned against the collimator jaws. Both slits were in the form of a 6.3-mm-diam hole in the middle and were aligned to the source. The use of a pair of slits was intended to eliminate any influence on the ion chamber readings due to field-size dependent charge contribution from the flattening filter and collimator jaw forward scattering. In addition, the setup permits to observe the degree of field-size dependence on BSR. Charge measurements from the Therac-20 18-MV x rays showed a 7.5% field-size dependence on BSR whereas 6- and 18-MV x rays from Varian Clinac-1800 showed less than 2% dependence on BSR. The telescopic method was found to be easy to use and permitted direct determination of BSR contributions

It provides greater information concerning tumor activity and characterization of the tumor tissue than is possible with MRI techniques alone. Moreover, 1HMRS may ultimately prove to be a highly beneficial modality in the post-irradiation care of patients with brain gliomas. This paper reviews the current status of 1HMRS with the emphasis on its clinical utility in the diagnosis of active tumor processes of gliomas, and its use in planning surgical and radiation therapy interventions and monitoring tumor treatment paradigms.

One patient had both cerebral andmyocardial infarcts and died at age 25 years. Necropsy disclosed both adventitial and intimal fibrosis of the left carotid artery and greater than 75 per cent cross-sectional area luminal narrowing of both the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries. The other patient, a 33 year old man, had no cerebral symptoms in life but total obstruction of the right carotid artery secondary to a thorotrastoma was found at necropsy. Vascular complications due to thorotrast appear to represent consequences of chronic alpha irradiation	
3597	Potential improvement of three dimension treatment planning and proton therapy in the outcome of maxillary sinus cancer	Anatomy, Boston, Brain, Brain Stem, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Maxillary Sinus, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Morbidity, Optic Chiasm, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Survival, X-Rays	Carcinomas arising in the maxillary sinus are challenging technical problems for radiotherapists due to the complexity of the regional anatomy and the close relations of the tumor to dose-limiting critical structures (eyes, optic nerves, optic chiasm, and brain stem). This study shows that an improvement in the dose distribution can be achieved with the use of three dimensional treatment planning and a combination of x-ray and proton beam arrangements. Although tumor coverage was identical when comparing dose distributions of X rays alone to X rays plus proton beam boost, the critical structures received less dose in the X rays plus proton beam plan. Because a superior dose distribution should yield an improved local control and reduced morbidity, a benefit in survival could be expected

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and December 2001, 74 patients were treated for chordomas and chondrosarcomas with carbon ion RT at the "Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung" (GSI). Seven patients reirradiated with reduced carbon ion doses after conventional RT were excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 evaluable patients (44 chordomas and 23 chondrosarcomas) who received a full course of carbon ion therapy. Tumor-conform application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with active energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included intensity modulation and biological plan optimization. A median dose of 60 GyE was applied to the target volume within 20 consecutive days at a dose of 3.0 GyE per fraction. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-46 months). At 3 years, actuarial local control was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 87% for chordomas, respectively. Partial tumor remission was observed in 14/44 (31%) chordoma patients and in 4/23 (17%) chondrosarcoma patients. At 3 years, actuarial overall survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 89% for chordomas, respectively. No severe side effects > CTC degrees III have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the clinical efficiency and safety of scanning beam delivery of carbon ion beams in patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. The observation of tumor regressions at a dose level of 60 GyE may indicate that the biological effectiveness of carbon ions in chordomas and chondrosarcomas is higher than initially estimated

The main task is to estimate the cost per treated patient. The cost analysis is restricted to the therapeutic phase from the hospital point of view. An original methodology for cost assessment per treatment protocol is developed based on standard costs. Costs related to direct medical activity are based on the production process analysis, whereas indirect and non direct medical costs are allocated to each protocol using relevant cost-drivers. The resulting cost model will take into account the specificities of each therapeutic protocol as well as the particularities of each of the European projects

Ring-shaped recurrence with extraocular extension appeared thirty-six months later and required enucleation. Histologic study revealed a predominant epithelioid cell type tumor, flattened in previously treated area.

This is demonstrated by the correlation of inactivation probability with nuclear area when cells having nuclei of different sizes are compared. This single-hit inactivation is irreversible and unmodifiable. The ion path length over which cells will be inactivated in this way is calculable from stopping power theory. Laboratory experiments in which three-dimensional human cell cultures were irradiated with high-energy nitrogen ions (3.9 GeV) at the Princeton Particle Accelerator confirm that cells are inactivated with maximum probability over the last 0.5 cm of the ion trajectory. This means that groups of adjacent cells in the ion path will be inactivated by a single ion with high probability. Organized systems of multiplying cells would be expected to amplify this spatially correlated effect of heavy ion irradiation. Abnormalities induced in Zea seedlings by heavy ion irradiation of seeds are consistent with the inactivation of embryonic cells in groups	
2516	15 years experience with helium ion radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Survival, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To review the long-term experience of helium ion therapy as a therapeutic alternative to enucleation for uveal melanoma, particularly with respect to survival, local control, and morbidity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)	
2988	A review of high LET facilities, existing and projected, with emphasis on the radiobiologic aspects	Canada, Cell Survival, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Elementary Particles, Energy Transfer, England, Europe, Gamma Rays, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Mesons, Neutrons, Nuclear Medicine, Oxygen, Oxygen/pd [Pharmacology], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiobiology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, United States, X-Rays	The introduction of high LET radiations into radiotherapy is an exciting development. Neutron facilities are already in clinical use in England and the United States, while machines to produce negative pi mesons and high energy heavy ions are in an advanced stage of development in Canada, the United States and Europe. The state of the art at each of these installations is reviewed. The therapeutic merits of various heavy particles are compared with conventional photon beams. Lowering the OER (oxygen enhancement ratio) and improvement in the depth dose pattern are the principal advantages sought. Neutrons result in a somewhat lower OER but offer depth-dose patterns that are barely the equal of x- and gamma-rays. Protons by contrast produce excellent dose distributions, but no reduction of OER. Negative pi mesons improve both depth dose pattern and OER to some extent. High energy heavy nuclei show the greatest promise as far as lowering the OER is concerned, but will probably not equal pions in depth dose pattern. More radiobiologic data are urgently needed for all of these new radiation modalities	
4298	A solution to the Yang equation with electron energy loss following Harder's formula	Diffusion, Electrons, Humans, Indiana, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Scattering,Radiation, Solutions, Universities	The Yang diffusion transport equation for charged particles was modified to allow the linear angular scattering power to vary with penetration depth in the scattering medium. Assuming charged particle energy loss to be a linear function of depth, conditional solutions to this transport equation have been found for the two cases of interest specified by Yang. The normalized excess path length distributions predicted for a 10-MeV electron beam show a shift toward larger excess path lengths compared to Yang's solutions

Using a detailed consultative process involving representatives of a wide variety of professional organizations including the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, the study identified the items necessary for inclusion in a data collection instrument to allow assessment of treatment modalities, quality of care, comparative efficiency and cost-effectiveness of radiation oncology services. The instrument has been tested by a pilot study and the results indicate that the items included in the instrument have received acceptance amongst health care providers	
1427	Proton therapy for exudative age-related macular degeneration: a randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial	Aged, Choroidal Neovascularization/et [Etiology], Choroidal Neovascularization/pp [Physiopathology], Choroidal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Double-Blind Method, Exudates and Transudates, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Humans, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/co [Complications], Macular Degeneration/pp [Physiopathology], Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Research, Sample Size, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: To examine the effect of proton beam irradiation on subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Randomized, prospective, sham-controlled, double-masked treatment trial. METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects with subfoveal CNVM due to AMD were randomly assigned to 16-Gy proton irradiation delivered in two fractions 24 hours apart or to sham control treatment. Recruitment was halted at 37 subjects for ethical reasons regarding randomization to sham treatment when Food and Drug Administration approval of Visudyne was anticipated. RESULTS: Proton irradiation was associated with a trend toward stabilization of visual acuity, but this association did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found within the fluorescein angiography data, including greatest linear dimension of CNVM total size, area of active leakage, area of associated subretinal hemorrhage, and intensity. CONCLUSIONS: With the acceptance of photodynamic therapy, future studies will require more complex design and larger sample size to determine whether radiation can play either a primary or adjunctive role in treating these lesions	
3722	Base of skull chordoma. A correlative study of histologic and clinical features of 62 cases	Adult, Biopsy, Boston, Chordoma, Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/ul [Ultrastructure], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Mitotic Index, Necrosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Sacrum, Sex Factors, Skull, Skull Base, Skull Neoplasms, Skull Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Skull Neoplasms/ul [Ultrastructure], Survival, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND. Chordomas are uncommon primary malignant tumors of bone that typically occur in the axial skeleton including the sacrum, vertebrae, and skull base. The base of skull tumors usually are not amenable to complete surgical resection, and most require postoperative radiotherapy. The natural history of skull base chordoma is typified by slow locally invasive tumor progression and eventual death, although few parameters are known that allow stratification of patients into prognostic groups. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with skull base chordomas treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital by proton beam irradiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up information were reviewed in an attempt to identify clinical and pathologic parameters that predicted outcome. RESULTS. Female sex, tumor necrosis in preradiation treatment biopsy, and tumor volume in excess of 70 ml were each independent predictors of shortened overall survival after radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. CONCLUSIONS. Stratification of patients with skull base chordoma into poor and good outcome groups can be performed using the three parameters identified in our study. In addition, the striking difference in survival between the sexes suggests that further investigations of these tumors should include determination of their hormonal receptors status and consideration of hormonal manipulation in their management	
619	Radioimmunoconjugates in acute leukemia treatment: the future is radiant. [Review] [38 refs]	Alpha Particles, Antibodies,Monoclonal/pd [Pharmacology], Antigens,CD/bi [Biosynthesis], Antigens,CD45/bi [Biosynthesis], Antigens,Differentiation,Myelomonocytic/bi [Biosynthesis], Beta Rays, Cell Adhesion Molecules/bi [Biosynthesis], Clinical Trials as Topic, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Germany, Humans, Immunoconjugates/tu [Therapeutic Use], Leukemia/rt [Radiotherapy], Quality Control, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Research, Rhenium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Risk, Stem Cell Transplantation, Yttrium Radioisotopes, Yttrium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Targeted radiotherapy of the bone marrow using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies is a therapeutic approach of considerable potential for the treatment of acute leukemia in addition to or as a substitute for total body irradiation. The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]	
3347	Fast neutron radiotherapy for sarcomas of soft tissue, bone, and cartilage.

There are no definitive randomized studies comparing high and low linear energy transfer radiotherapy for these tumor systems, but a review of published series is highly suggestive of a therapeutic advantage for fast neutrons. For soft tissue sarcomas, the local control rate is 53% (158 of 297) with fast neutrons, compared with 38% (49 of 128) with photons/electrons; for osteogenic sarcomas, the local control rate is 55% (40 of 73) with fast neutrons, compared with 21% (15 of 73) with photons/electrons; and for chondrosarcomas, the local control rate is 49% (25 of 51) with fast neutrons, compared with 33% (10 of 30) with photons/electrons. An ongoing clinical trial for these tumors is also described. [References: 33]	
1904	Build-up modification of commercial diodes for entrance dose measurements in 'higher energy' photon beams	Belgium, Copper, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Iron, Lead, Particle Accelerators, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Reference Values, Research	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several commercially available p-type diodes do not provide sufficient build-up for in-vivo dosimetry in 'higher' energy photon beams, and only limited information could be found in the literature describing the correction factor variation and/or the achievable accuracy for in-vivo dosimetry methods in this energy range. The first aim of this study is to assess and analyze the variation of diode correction factors for entrance dose measurements at higher photon energies. In a second step the total build up thickness of the diode has been modified in order to minimize the correction factor variation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diode correction factors accounting for non-reference conditions (field size, source surface distance, tray, wedge, and block) are determined in 18-25 MV photon beams provided by different treatment units for Scanditronix p-type diodes recommended for higher energy photon beams: old type and new type EDP-20, and EDP-30 diodes. Hemispherical build-up caps of different materials (copper, iron, lead) are used to increase the total build-up thickness. Perturbation effects with and without additional build-up caps are assessed for the three diode types. RESULTS: For unmodified diodes field size correction factors (C(FS)) vary between 1.7% and 6%, dependent on diode type and treatment unit. For example, for an old type EDP-20 the C(FS) variation at 18 MV is much higher on a GE linac (5%) as compared to the Philips machine (1.7%). Depending on diode type, this variation can be reduced to 1-2% when adding additional build-up. The variation of source to surface distance correction factors is almost independent of build-up thickness. By adding additional build-up the influence of trays and blocks can be almost eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: The correction factor variation of unmodified diodes reflects the variation of the electron contamination with treatment geometry. A total build-up thickness of 30 mm is found to be the 'best compromise' for the three types of diodes investigated when measuring entrance doses in the energy range between 18 and 25 MV	
2407	Strategy for planned radiotherapy of malignant gliomas: postoperative treatment with combinations of high dose proton irradiation and tumor seeking radionuclides	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Combined Modality Therapy, Epidermal Growth Factor/tu [Therapeutic Use], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma/su [Surgery], Glioblastoma/th [Therapy], Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neutron Capture Therapy, Protons, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Sweden, Universities	A strategy for improved treatment of malignant gliomas grade III-IV is presented. The strategy can briefly be described as surgical removal of the bulky tumor, high precision external irradiation of small brain volumes over and near the primary tumor area with high doses from proton beams, and thereafter treatment of spread cells with toxic radionuclides. Proton beams suitable for this are under development. The clinical effects of high single doses on malignant gliomas grade III-IV are presently tested with conventional gamma radiation. Targeting of spread glioma cells with toxic radionuclides tagged to epidermal growth factor, EGF, or to EGF-dextran is presently tested in experimental systems and can, in the near future, be tested in combination with local high doses of external proton radiation. The possibilities to combine proton beams with EGF-guided neutron capture therapy will be considered in a longer perspective

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics	
715	A novel method to correct for pitch and yaw patient setup errors in helical tomotherapy	Equipment Design/mt [Methods], Head/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Models,Statistical, Models,Theoretical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Rotation	An accurate means of determining and correcting for daily patient setup errors is important to the cancer outcome in radiotherapy. While many tools have been developed to detect setup errors, difficulty may arise in accurately adjusting the patient to account for the rotational error components. A novel, automated method to correct for rotational patient setup errors in helical tomotherapy is proposed for a treatment couch that is restricted to motion along translational axes. In tomotherapy, only a narrow superior/inferior section of the target receives a dose at any instant, thus rotations in the sagittal and coronal planes may be approximately corrected for by very slow continuous couch motion in a direction perpendicular to the scanning direction. Results from proof-of-principle tests indicate that the method improves the accuracy of treatment delivery, especially for long and narrow targets. Rotational corrections about an axis perpendicular to the transverse plane continue to be implemented easily in tomotherapy by adjustment of the initial gantry angle

We studied cytotoxic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon beams on glioma cell lines with either mutant or wild-type p53. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell lines U-87 and U-138 expressing wild-type p53 and U-251 and U-373 expressing mutant p53 were used. These cells were irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in the National Institute of Radiologic Science or X-rays. A standard colony-forming assay and flow cytometric detection of apoptosis were performed. Cell cycle progression and the expression of p53, p21, and bax proteins were examined. RESULTS: High LET carbon radiation was more cytotoxic than low LET X-ray treatment against glioma cells. The effects of the carbon beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status but were reduced by G(1) arrest, which was independent of p21 expression. The expression of bax remained unchanged in all four cell lines. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high LET charged particle radiation can induce cell death in glioma cells more effectively than X-rays and that cell death other than p53-dependent apoptosis may participate in the cytotoxicity of heavy charged particles. Thus, it might prove to be an effective alternative radiotherapy for patients with gliomas harboring mutated p53 gene	
3154	A comparison of the gamma component of two high energy neutron therapy beams	Belgium, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Gamma Rays, Gamma Rays/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Models,Structural, Neutrons, Protons, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, South Africa	Reciprocal neutron dosimetry intercomparisons have been undertaken between the National Accelerator Centre (NAC), South Africa, and the Universite Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Belgium. A comparison of the gamma components measured in the respective therapy beams using the classic twin-detector method formed part of the study. This is important in clinical applications since the biological effects of neutrons and gamma rays are different. The gamma component under various irradiation conditions was derived from pairs of measurements with tissue equivalent ionization chambers and Geiger-Muller counters. The gamma component expressed as a fraction of the gamma dose relative to the total dose agreed within less than 0.01, with the measurements with the NAC Geiger-Muller counters being consistently higher than those with the UCL counter. A re-evaluation of the kU value of the UCL Geiger-Muller counter reduces the differences to less than 0.005 at NAC and less than 0.002 for the measurements at UCL. The results obtained are highly satisfactory in view of the complexity and difficulty of the measurements

These measurements are of total (neutron and gamma) doses, and include: depth doses for wedged and unwedged fields at various treatment distances; profile measurements and the production of associated isodose charts; calibration of the dosimetry system of the cyclotron; and determination of variations in calibration associated with changes in field size, wedge and focus-skin distance. Measurements have also been performed to estimate the degree of long-term stability of both calibration and field uniformity

METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus anthracis Sterne 34F2 spores were dispersed in non-fat dry milk and then placed into standard business postal envelopes. The spores were treated with a sequence of irradiation doses to determine the decimal reduction value (D10) in kiloGrays (kGy). The average D10 value was 3.35 +/- 0.02 kGy. CONCLUSIONS: An irradiation dose of 40.2 kGy would be required to result in a process equivalent to the thermal canning process (12 D10 reduction) to eliminate Clostridium botulinum spores. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Irradiation is an effective means of reducing or eliminating B. anthracis spores in a dry medium in postal envelopes	
2015	Physical aging by soft ultrasonic wave enhances ethanol metabolism: metabolic process of wine as followed by 400 mhz 1H-NMR spectroscopy	Absorption, Aged, Aging, Animals, Blood Chemical Analysis/mt [Methods], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Ethanol/bl [Blood], Ethanol/re [Radiation Effects], Food Irradiation/mt [Methods], Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Metabolic Clearance Rate/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Rabbits, Time, Ultrasonics, Water, Wine/an [Analysis], Wine/re [Radiation Effects]	In natural aging of spirits or wine, the dynamic structure of ethanol-water clusters changes to a smaller and more uniform state. Through experience we know that naturally aged ones have higher metabolism than the non-aged ones. Also, the same effect as natural aging can be obtained in various types of spirits or wines by the treatment for a period of time with soft ultrasonic wave (US). In this study, we compared ethanol metabolism in human subjects dosed with non-treated white wine (control = CON) and with US treated wine. Ethanol levels in human sera were followed by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy after administration of wine doses. Experimental results indicated that ethanol metabolism was enhanced 18% in subjects when US treated wine was used rather than when non-treated (CON) was used. Other experiments using rabbits showed that a 20% ethanol-aqueous solution was absorbed 18% more rapidly by the group dosed with US wine than by the CON group. From these experimental facts, it was theorized that ethanol metabolism depends on the rapidity of ethanol absorption in the human body. And it can be concluded that US treatment brings about the same effect on spirits or wines as natural aging

2479	Off-axis output factors for 6MV and 18MV photons.[erratum appears in Australas Phys Eng Sci Med 1997 Dec;20(4):247]	Air, Biophysics, Humans, Models,Theoretical, New Zealand, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation, Time, Universities	A series of in-air measurements showed that collimator scatter (Sc) did not change significantly for 6MV photons when the centre of the field was moved away from the central axis. This result enabled a model to be developed for the off-axis Effective Output Factor (EOF) which was then verified for 6MV and 18MV photons on a Varian 2100c accelerator and for 6MV photons on a Varian 600c accelerator. Thus off-axis output factors may be predicted, for a range of rectangular asymmetric fields, using only the Primary Off-Centre Ratio (POCR) in air and the on-axis output factor. Depth doses were also investigated off-axis and found to have no clinically significant differences compared with on-axis depth doses, for depths less than 7.5 cm for 6MV and 12.5 cm for 18MV photons. The model is simple to implement and avoids the need for a measurement for each patient, thus saving accelerator time	
1356	[Changes in 1H-MRS in glioma patients before and after irradiation: the significance of quantitative analysis of choline-containing compounds]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Biological Markers, Biological Markers/an [Analysis], Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choline/an [Analysis], Female, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/me [Metabolism], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Lipids, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Time, Treatment Outcome	The evaluation of the response to radiation therapy in brain tumor patients is a major and an important issue. Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages

The study was designed to serve as a cytogenetic analysis along with the therapeutic procedure of ankylosing spondylitis patients who were undergoing a treatment with (224)Ra-chloride. The total administered activity was 10 MBq, and the treatment followed a schedule of 10 i.v. injections per week, each with a dose of 1 MBq of (224)Ra. The calculation of absorbed doses delivered to the blood used the models suggested by the ICRP and yielded a value of 4.7 mGy/MBq. The frequency of chromosomal aberrations observed during the course of therapy was related to the blood dose. The frequency of dicentric chromosomes induced in vivo was found to agree well with the corresponding value of dicentrics induced in vitro. However--given that peripheral lymphocytes are in the cell cycle's G(0) stage--an unexpected increase with dose in the yield of chromatid breaks was observed, with about 95% of them occurring in cells without any other chromosome-type aberrations. Reasons for the production of chromatid breaks are discussed	
668	Gene expression changes in normal human skin fibroblasts induced by HZE-particle radiation	California, Cells,Cultured, Cosmic Radiation/ae [Adverse Effects], Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Gene Expression/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Ions, Iron, Linear Energy Transfer, Radiation, Research, Skin/cy [Cytology], X-Rays	Studies have shown that radiation exposure affects global gene expression in mammalian cells. However, little is known about the effects of HZE particles on gene expression. To study these effects, human skin fibroblasts were irradiated with HZE particles of different energies and LETs. The data obtained from these experiments indicate that changes in gene expression are dependent on the energy of the radiation source. Particles with the highest energy, i.e. iron, induced the biggest expression changes in terms of numbers of genes and magnitudes of changes. Many genes were found to undergo significant expression changes after HZE-particle irradiation, including CDKN1A/p21, MDM2, TNFRSF6/fas, PCNA and RAD52. Unlike X rays, HZE particles expose cells to two types of radiation: primary ions and delta rays. We hypothesized that the biological effects of delta rays, which are secondary electron emissions, should resemble the effects of X rays. To explore this idea, gene expression changes between cells that had been irradiated with HZE particles and X rays were compared. The results support our hypothesis since the number of genes that commonly changed after exposure to both radiations increased as a function of particle energy	
2615	Micronucleus induction in 10 human tumour cells after high- and low-dose radiation	Cell Line, France, Humans, Micronucleus Tests/mt [Methods], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Tolerance, Radiobiology, Research, Survival, Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects]	A number of data measuring survival of animal or human cells to low LET ionizing radiation have demonstrated that these cells may be hypersensitive to doses below 1 Gy, possibly due to the absence of an inducible repair mechanism, which is observed at higher doses. The production of micronuclei (MN) in cells exposed to ionizing radiation reflects genotoxic damage. Moreover, the micronucleus assay is sensitive to low radiation doses. We have exposed 10 human tumour cell lines to doses ranging between 0.12 and 4 Gy. Using cytochalasin B to block the cells in a binucleate phase, we have scored the fraction of binucleate cells (BNC) expressing MN, as well as the number of MN per BNC, as a function of gamma-ray dose. Experimental points were fitted with a binomial equation. Doses from 1 to 4 Gy were fitted separately from those below 1 Gy, and the initial slopes after both fits were compared. Taken together, the initial slopes of MN induction after low-dose (LD) irradiation were not different from those after high-dose (HD) irradiation. Only in one cell line was a significant increase in MN production detected after LD irradiation. This cell line had the shallowest linear term after HD irradiation. It appeared that the likeliness of expressing hypersensitivity at LD was correlated with the quadratic term of MN induction at HD, which does not contradict an inducible repair hypothesis. However, the failure of observation of a significant hypersensitivity at LD for nine cell lines, and the high variability of response at LD suggests that this occasional effect may be influenced by other factors as well

2574	Dose enhancement in buildup region by lead, aluminum, and lucite absorbers for 15 MVp photon beam	Absorption, Air, Aluminum, Biophysics, Electrons, Humans, Lead, Methylmethacrylate, Methylmethacrylates, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Poland, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	Changes in dose distributions in buildup region resulting from the presence of lead, aluminum, and lucite absorbers above the surface of a polystyrene phantom were evaluated. The surface dose, as a function of the absorber thickness, is presented as well as the influence of the air gap between the lead absorber and the phantom surface. It has been found that the surface dose does not depend on absorber thickness for absorbers thicker than the range of secondary electrons in the absorber material (after corrections for the attenuation of the primary beam in the absorber). Similarly, the depth dose curves in the phantom were elevated only at depths lower than the range of secondary electrons in the phantom. The applicability of the presented data in clinical radiotherapy is discussed	
1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses	
448	Risk factors for neovascular glaucoma after carbon ion radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma using dose-volume histogram analysis	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Optic Disk, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Research, Risk, Risk Factors	PURPOSE: To determine the risk factors for neovascular glaucoma (NVG) after carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) of choroidal melanoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 55 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated between 2001 and 2005 with C-ion RT based on computed tomography treatment planning. All patients had a tumor of large size or one located close to the optic disk. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of NVG for the following parameters; gender, age, dose-volumes of the iris-ciliary body and the wall of eyeball, and irradiation of the optic disk (ODI). RESULTS: Neovascular glaucoma occurred in 23 patients and the 3-year cumulative NVG rate was 42.6 +/- 6.8% (standard error), but enucleation from NVG was performed in only three eyes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant risk factors for NVG were V50IC (volume irradiated > or =50 GyE to iris-ciliary body) (p = 0.002) and ODI (p = 0.036). The 3-year NVG rate for patients with V50IC > or =0.127 mL and those with V50IC <0.127 mL were 71.4 +/- 8.5% and 11.5 +/- 6.3%, respectively. The corresponding rate for the patients with and without ODI were 62.9 +/- 10.4% and 28.4 +/- 8.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dose-volume histogram analysis with computed tomography indicated that V50IC and ODI were independent risk factors for NVG. An irradiation system that can reduce the dose to both the anterior segment and the optic disk might be worth adopting to investigate whether or not incidence of NVG can be decreased with it	
1451	Fricke gel dosimetry in boron neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Gels, Humans, Hydrogen, Italy, Neutrons, Nitrogen, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Reproducibility of Results, Research	Gel dosimetry allows three-dimensional (3D) measurement of absorbed dose in tissue-equivalent dosemeter phantoms. Gel phantoms are imaged using optical techniques. In neutron capture therapy (NCT), properly designed gel dosemeters can give 3D dose distributions, due to the various components of the secondary radiation, in phantoms exposed in the thermal or epithermal column of a nuclear reactor. In addition to the therapeutic dose arising from the reaction 10B(n,alpha)7Li, the other dose components are also obtainable, i.e. the gamma dose (due to reactor background and to the reaction 1H(n,gamma)2H of thermal neutrons with hydrogen, the dose due to protons emitted in the reaction 14N(n,p)14C of thermal neutrons with nitrogen and the dose due to recoil protons resulting from elastic scattering of epithermal neutrons	
4410	Thick beryllium target as an epithermal neutron source for neutron capture therapy	Beryllium, Engineering, Equipment Design, Gamma Rays, Georgia, Health Physics, Heat, Humans, Lithium, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Neutrons, Nuclear Reactors, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Protons, Time	Accelerator-based intense epithermal neutron sources for Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT) have been considered as an alternative to nuclear reactors. Lithium (Li) has generally received the widest attention for this application, since the threshold energy is low and neutron yield is high. Because of the poor thermal and chemical properties of Li and the need for heat removal in the target, the design of Li targets has been quite difficult. Beryllium (Be) has been thought of as an alternative target because of its good thermal and chemical properties and reasonable neutron yield. However, in order to have a neutron yield comparable to that of a thick Li target bombarded with 2.5 MeV protons, the proton energy required for a thick Be target must be approaching 4 MeV. Consequently, the neutrons emitted are more energetic. In addition, a significant amount of high-energy gamma rays, which is undesirable, will occur when Be is bombarded with low-energy protons. Regardless of the more energetic neutrons and additional gamma rays, in this paper it is shown that it is possible to develop a high-quality and high-intensity epithermal neutron beam based on a thick Be target for NCT treatment. For a fixed proton current, the optimal Be-target-based beam (with 4-MeV protons) can produce a neutron beam, with both quality and intensity slightly better than those produced by the optimal Li-target-based beam (with 2.5-MeV protons). The single-session NCT treatment time for the optimal Be-target-based beam is estimated to be 88 min for a proton current of 50 mA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[French]	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/is [Instrumentation], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/mt [Methods]	The authors carried out routine measurements in vivo, and emphasise their value in radiotherapy. After reviewing the objectives of in vivo measurements in general, and showing the problems posed by routine measurements, they describe the technique of measurement using thermoluminescent dosimeters and the problems associated with their use in patients treated with the aid of a 5.5 MV linear accelerator. Results based upon 232 routine measurements made it possible to establish a correlation between the dose delivered and the expected dose. Under optimal functional conditions, almost all the deviations seen were less than 5% whilst higher deviations occurred when the apparatus showed signs of instability. They conclude that routine in vivo measurements are extremely useful in ensuring that planned treatment is carried out in a satisfactory manner and also in the early detection of potential faults in equipment	
2933	Reassessment of radiation therapy for the management of lung cancer in patients with chronic pulmonary disease	Aged, Chronic Disease, Female, Forced Expiratory Volume, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/co [Complications], Lung Diseases/th [Therapy], Lung Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Pneumonitis, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Risk, Survival	Surgery has remained the mainstay of definitive treatment for lung cancer. Radiation therapy has been advocated when the location of the lung cancer precludes resection or the severity or the cardiopulmonary impairment indicates that the patient cannot withstand the proposed resection. Extended field irradiation has been shown to improve tumor control and survival. However, in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, extended field irradiation may exacerbate pulmonary insufficiency and compromise survival. Between 1975 and 1980, 29 patients with lung cancer and chronic pulmonary disease were treated by involved field irradiation (IFR). This was compared to the experience of 41 patients who had been treated prior to 1975 by extended field irradiation (EFR). The frequency of subjective response and tumor control were comparable in each group. One patient treated by IFR developed a marginal recurrence. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 7/41 (17%) EFR patients versus 2/29 (7%) IFR. Treatment related death occurred in 2/41 (5%) EFR versus 1/29 (3.3%) IFR. One year disease free survival was 8/41 (19%) EFR versus 12/29 (41%) IFR. Two of 14 (14%) IFR patients at risk five years are alive without evidence of disease

Convolution kernels were employed that had been calculated by Mackie using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code. The EGS4 code was also used to estimate initially the spectrum by simulating the production, filtering, and flattening of the beam in the collimator of the linear accelerator. The continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum was modeled using five discrete energies. The more subtle field-size effects of collimator scattering on the spectrum were obtained by calculating corrections to the spectral components using a least-squares search technique. Dose distributions were obtained using FFT convolutions of the kernels for each energy with the spectrally weighted fluence distributions for that energy. The dose distributions were compared with isodose distributions measured in a water phantom. The agreement was generally found to be better than 1% on the central axis. The calculation time for a single three-dimensional beam was approximately 20 min using a VAX/750 without an array processor. Methods were explored to reduce the calculation time using similar hardware, and estimates were made of how to reduce the calculation time using a more sophisticated computer system	
3079	Total-body irradiation on an isocentric linear accelerator: a radiation output compensation technique	Equipment Failure Analysis, Feedback, Humans, Methods, New Zealand, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Supine Position, Time, Universities, Whole-Body Irradiation/is [Instrumentation], Whole-Body Irradiation/mt [Methods]	A treatment technique for total-body irradiation (TBI) is proposed that combines arc therapy with dynamic output control to achieve high-grade dose uniformity. The patient lies on a low couch and receives exposure in the prone and supine positions from a modulated arcing beam. The technique has been validated using a personal computer to control the linear accelerator and we demonstrate that only minor alterations to current dynamic therapy systems would be required. We have examined the practical application of this treatment with emphasis on methods of conformal therapy where an optimized dose distribution is prepared from a matrix of caliper measurements taken from the patient. This technique provides a means for regular TBI treatment on a computer-controlled linear accelerator that is easy to set up, requires short exposure times and is comfortable for the patient

Tissue equivalent (TE) ionization chambers were first calibrated in 60Co beams and then exposed in the neutron beam at different depths in a water phantom; the largest difference observed in neutron beam measurements with all the chambers tested was 0.89%, and most of them agreed to within less than 0.5%. The gamma component at four depths was derived from measurements with Geiger-Muller counters; the results obtained with the two counters (Nice and Louvain-la-Neuve), expressed as a percentage of the total dose (neutron + gamma), agreed to within less than 0.03% and the value increased from 1.4 to 4.2% between 2 and 20 cm in depth

The solution proposed in this work consists of successive stacks of Al, polytetrafluoroethylene, commercially known as Teflon, and LiF as moderator and neutron absorber, and Pb as reflector. This assembly is easy to build and its cost is relatively low. An exhaustive Monte Carlo simulation study has been performed evaluating the doses delivered to a Snyder model head phantom by a neutron production Li-metal target based on the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction for proton bombarding energies of 1.92, 2.0, 2.3 and 2.5 MeV. Three moderator thicknesses have been studied and the figures of merit show the advantage of irradiating with near-resonance-energy protons (2.3 MeV) because of the relatively high neutron yield at this energy, which at the same time keeps the fast neutron healthy tissue dose limited and leads to the lowest treatment times. A moderator of 34 cm length has shown the best performance among the studied cases	
2475	Dose calculations for arbitrarily shaped electron beams	Computers, Electrons, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	A method for the calculation of absorbed dose distributions of arbitrarily shaped electron beams is described. Isodose distributions and the output factor of a newly designed treatment field can be predicted with good accuracy, without the need for any dose measurement in the actual field. Two different Gaussian pencil beams are used as building elements for the treatment beams of each electron energy. The dose distributions of the pencil beams are derived from measurements of broad beam dose distributions; in this way the influence of electrons scattered by the applicator walls is taken into account. The contribution to the dose by electrons scattered from a high Z metal frame which defines the treatment field contour is calculated separately and added. This calculation is based on experimentally derived data. The method has been tested for electron beams with 6, 10, 14 and 20 MeV nominal energy. The distance between calculated and measured isodose lines with values between 90 and 10 per cent of the maximum dose did not exceed a limit of 0.3 cm. The difference between calculated and measured output factors remained within 2 per cent

A germanium detector was used to measure the number of photoproduct gamma-rays emitted. The yield values were analyzed for photonuclear cross section using PHONUC II, a program especially adapted for use with yield data from thick-target bremsstrahlung. The cross section shows distinct resonance peaks at 26.3 +/- 0.3, 27.3 +/- 0.4 and 30.3 +/- 0.5 MeV. Possible theoretical origins of these resonances and applications of the reaction in accelerator energy calibration are discussed

Specifically, the use of nuclear medicine in oncology is greatly contributing to both imaging and therapy aspects. Targeted therapies are a major field of interest since it increases efficiency and reduces side effects. Brachytherapy is among the most valuable of recent developments for treating localized tumours resulting in improvements in improved quality of life. This is primarily because it irradiates cancerous cells most exclusively while barely effecting healthy tissue. The use of radiochemicals implies specific management for production, transport and handling that have limited the development of this technique. This review article describes brachytherapy and their latest developments. Furthermore, alternative activation methods for the production of radioisotopes and a novel delivery system for targeted multi-therapy by using PLA-ferrite nanospheres are described.

1971	Two-effective-source method for the calculation of in-air output at various source-to-detector distances in wedged fields	Algorithms, Biophysics, Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation, Universities	A simple algorithm was developed for calculation of the in-air output at various source-to-detector distances (SDDs) on the central axis for wedged fields. In the algorithm we dealt independently with two effective sources, one for head scatter and the other for wedge scatter. Varian 2100C with 18 and 8 MV photon beams was used to examine this algorithm. The effective source position for head scatter for wedged fields was assumed to be the same as that for open fields, and the effective source position for wedge scatter was assumed to be a certain distance upstream from the physical location of the wedge. The shift of the effective source for wedge scatter, w, was found to be independent of field size. Moreover, we observed no systematic dependency of w on wedge angle or beam energy. One value, w = 5.5 cm, provided less than 1% difference in in-air outputs through the whole experimental range, i.e., 6 x 6 to 20 x 20 cm2 field size (15 x 20 cm2 for 60 degrees wedge), 15 degrees-60 degrees wedge angle, 80-130 cm SDD, and both 18 and 8 MV photon beams. This algorithm can handle the case in which use of a tertiary collimator with an external wedge makes the field size for the determination of wedge scatter different from that for head scatter. In this case, without the two-effective-source method, the maximum of 4.7% and 2.6% difference can be given by the inverse square method and one-effective-source method in a 45 degrees wedged field with 18 MV. Differences can be larger for thicker wedges. Enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) fields were also examined. It was found that no second effective source is required for EDW fields

While giving excellent agreement with measurement for Cobalt-60 radiation, it tends to underestimate the lung correction required for higher energy x rays and is undefined for distances beyond an interface less than the buildup distance. This paper suggests a simple modification that greatly improves the agreement with measured data and gives a continuously defined function at all depths. Measurements have been made in a polystyrene and cork phantom to simulate the effects of lung; data are presented for beams of 8-MV x rays, 16-MV x rays, and Cobalt-60 gamma rays

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The MOSFET system response in terms of reproducibility, energy, dose rate and temperature dependence, dose-linearity from 1 to 25 Gy, angular response, and dose perturbation was analyzed in the 6-9-MeV electron beam energy range produced by an intraoperative radiotherapy-dedicated mobile accelerator. We compared these with the 6- and 9-MeV electron beams produced by a conventional accelerator. MOSFETs were also used in clinical dosimetry. RESULTS: In experimental conditions, the overall uncertainty of the MOSFET response was within 3.5% (+/-SD). The investigated electron energies and the dose rate did not significantly influence the MOSFET calibration factors. The dose perturbation was negligible. In vivo dosimetry results were in accordance with the predicted values within +/-5%. A discordance occurred either for an incorrect position of the dosimeter on the patient or when a great difference existed between the clinical and calibration setup, particularly when performing exit dose measurements. CONCLUSION: Metal oxide silicon field effect transistors are suitable for in vivo dosimetry during intraoperative radiotherapy because their overall uncertainty is comparable to the accuracy required in target dose delivery

It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment.

With static beam techniques, a margin around the target volume is added to compensate for patient and organ motion. This margin may not provide the solution with dynamic beam scanning. Intrafractional motion parallel and perpendicular to the beam axis is studied using two different scanning methods on a cubic water phantom. The direction of motion relative to the beam scanning direction as well as the method of scanning the proton beam across the target has a significant effect on the resulting dose distribution within the target volume. In the extreme cases studied here up to 100% of the target receives a dose outside the recommended limits, with a minimum dose as low as 34% of the prescribed dose	
210	Elevated sodium chloride concentrations enhance the bystander effects induced by low dose alpha-particle irradiation	Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Bystander Effect/de [Drug Effects], Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, DNA Breaks,Double-Stranded/de [Drug Effects], DNA Breaks,Double-Stranded/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Micronucleus Tests, Nitric Oxide/me [Metabolism], Physics, Research, Sodium Chloride/ad [Administration & Dosage], Sodium Chloride/to [Toxicity]	Previous studies have shown that high NaCl can be genotoxic, either alone or combined with irradiation. However, little is known about the relationship between environmental NaCl at elevated conditions and radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE). RIBE, which has been considered as non-targeted bystander responses, has been demonstrated to occur widely in various cell lines. In the present study, RIBE under the elevated NaCl culture condition was assessed in AG 1522 cells by both the induction of gamma-H2AX, a reliable marker of DNA double-strand break (DSB) for the early process (<1h post irradiation), and the generation of micronuclei (MN), a sensitive marker for relative long process of RIBE. Our results showed that in the absence of irradiation, NaCl at elevated concentration such as 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0g/L did not significantly increase the frequency of gamma-H2AX foci-positive cells and the number of foci per positive cell comparing with that NaCl at a normal concentration (6.8g/L). However, with 0.2cGy alpha-particle irradiation, the induced fraction of gamma-H2AX foci-positive cells and the number of induced gamma-H2AX foci per positive cell were significantly increased in both irradiated and adjacent non-irradiated regions. Similarly, the induction of MN by 0.2cGy alpha-particle irradiation also increased with the elevated NaCl concentrations. With N(G)-methyl-l-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, the induced fraction of foci-positive cells was effectively inhibited both in 0.2cGy alpha-particle irradiated and adjacent non-irradiated regions under either normal or elevated NaCl conditions. These results suggested that the cultures with elevated NaCl medium magnified the damage effects induced by the low dose alpha-particle irradiation and nitric oxide generated by irradiation was also very important in this process

We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments	
354	On the cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. [Review] [18 refs]	Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cost-Benefit Analysis, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm,Residual, Physics, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	AIM: The cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiotherapy (RT) for patients with skull base chordoma is analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary treatment costs and costs for recurrent tumors are estimated. The costs for treatment of recurrent tumors were estimated using a sample of 10 patients presenting with recurrent chordoma at the base of skull at DKFZ. Using various scenarios for the local control rate and reimbursements of Carbon ion therapy the cost-effectiveness of ion therapy for these tumors is analyzed. RESULTS: If local control rate for skull base chordoma achieved with carbon ion therapy exceeds 70.3%, the overall treatment costs for carbon RT are lower than for conventional RTI. The cost-effectiveness ratio for carbon RT is 2539 Euro per 1% increase in survival, or 7692 Euro per additional life year. CONCLUSION: Current results support the thesis that Carbon ion RT, although more expensive, is at least as cost-effective as advanced photon therapies for these patients. Ion RT, however, offers substantial benefits for the patients such as improved control rates and less severe side effects. [References: 18]	
346	Determination of the dose-depth distribution of proton beam using resazurin assay in vitro and diode laser-induced fluorescence detection	Breast, Cell Line, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/de [Drug Effects], Cell Survival/ph [Physiology], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fluorescence, Humans, Indicators and Reagents, Lasers, Linear Energy Transfer, Oxazines/ch [Chemistry], Probability, Protons, Research, Water, Xanthenes/ch [Chemistry]	In this study the dose-depth distribution pattern of proton beams was investigated by inactivation of human cells exposed to high-LET (linear energy transfer) protons. The proton beams accelerated up to 45 MeV were horizontally extracted from the cyclotron, and were delivered to the cells acutely through a home made prototype over a range of physical depths (in the form of a variable water column). The biological systems used here were two in vitro cell lines, including human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), and human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7). Cells were exposed to unmodulated proton beam radiation at a dose of 50 Gy similar to that used in therapy. Resazurin metabolism assay was investigated for measurement of cell response to irradiation as a simple and non-destructive assay. In the resazurin reduction test the non-fluorescent probe dye is reduced to pink and highly fluorescent resorufin. The dose-depth distribution of proton beam obtained based on the highly sensitive laser-induced fluorometric determination of resorufin was found to coincide well with the data collected using conventional film based dosimetry. The resazurin method yielded data comparable with the optical micrographs of the irradiated cells, showing the least cell survival at the measured Bragg-peak position of 10 mm. In addition, fused silica capillary was used as a sample container to increase the probability for irradiated laser beam to probe and excite resorufin in small sample volume of the capillary. The developed method has the potential to serve as a non-destructive, sample-thrifty, and time saving tool to realize more realistic, practical dose-depth distribution of proton beam compared to conventional in vitro cell viability assessment techniques	
4474	Microdosimetry for boron neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron/tu [Therapeutic Use], Fast Neutrons, Gamma Rays, Humans, Isotopes, Models,Structural, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Universities	Preclinical studies for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) using epithermal neutrons are ongoing at several laboratories. The absorbed dose in tumor cells is a function of the thermal neutron flux at depth, the microscopic boron concentration, and the size of the cell. Dosimetry is therefore complicated by the admixture of thermal, epithermal, and fast neutrons, plus gamma rays, and the array of secondary high-linear-energy-transfer particles produced within the patient from neutron interactions. Microdosimetry can be a viable technique for determining absorbed dose and radiation quality. A 2.5-cm-diameter tissue-equivalent gas proportional counter has been built with 50 parts per million (ppm) 10B incorporated into the walls and counting gas to simulate the boron uptake anticipated in tumors. Measurements of lineal energy (y) spectra for BNCT in simulated volumes of 1-10 microns diameter show a dose enhancement factor of 4.3 for 30 ppm boron, and a "y" of 250 keV/microns for the boron capture process. Chamber design plus details of experimental and calculated linear energy spectra will be presented

One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now

Despite tremendous gains, the radiation oncology community continues to struggle with several key questions. In general, the areas of controversy pertain to how to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. Specifically, key issues include dose escalation; the relative benefit of alternative forms of RT (ie, brachytherapy and protons); target localization; the use, timing, and duration of androgen deprivation; and the need for pelvic nodal irradiation. Multiple efforts have been made to address each of these issues; however, there is no consensus on how to resolve them. This review is an evidence-based critique of the available treatment approaches considered for the optimal use of radiotherapy as definitive management of clinically localized PCa. [References: 87]	
2550	An empirical formula for calculating the output factors of electron beams from a therac 20 linear accelerator	Canada, Hand, Humans, Mathematics, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	A polynomial formula, deduced from the data published by Mills et al. [Med. Phys. 12, 473 (1985)], in predicting the relative electron beam output factors, is presented in this report. This formula contains four parameters. By choosing four measured output factors, from four field sizes normalized at the field size of (10,10), the values of these parameters can be determined. A comparison of the factors predicted with this formula and the values measured by Mills et al. shows that the differences between the field sizes of (4,4) to (30,30) are 0.5% or less in 31 out of 35 field sizes. All the 35 field sizes are within 1% for an electron beam of 20 MeV. With 6-MeV electron beams, the differences are 0.5% or less in 26 out of 35 field sizes, and 1% or less in 31 out of 35 field sizes. Those having differences greater than 1% have either a small field size (5 cm) or a large field size (20 cm). Considering that this formula requires only four accurately measured relative output factors, one can predict the factors of any field within an acceptable accuracy. The calculation is easy with a scientific hand calculator. This formula provides major improvement over the other methods which require many measurements to be taken in order to interpolate with acceptable accuracy

[Review] [12 refs] [Japanese]	Cancer Care Facilities, Gamma Rays, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Relative Biological Effectiveness, X-Rays	Proton therapy delivers a conformed dose to the tumor, while reducing the dose to the surrounding tissues. Its relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is similar to that of conventional radiation, such as X-rays and gamma-rays. Proton therapy was first applied to humans in 1954. Thus for more than 19,000 patients have been treated. The distribution of the diseases to which it has been applied, however, has been quite limited. Although it is now performed at 17 institutions throughout the world, a hospital-based medically dedicated proton therapy system exists at only one institution. Therefore, proton therapy is considered to be an experimental treatment for most malignant diseases, and its equipment is also considered to be underdevelopment situation. In this paper, the project of proton treatment facility at the National Cancer Center (NCC, Kashiwa) is presented. Problems and future direction of our project are also discussed in this article.

1828	High-linear energy transfer (LET) alpha versus low-LET beta emitters in radioimmunotherapy of solid tumors: therapeutic efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity of 213Bi- versus 90Y-labeled CO17-1A Fab' fragments in a human colonic cancer model	Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Bismuth, Bismuth/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Bismuth/tu [Therapeutic Use], Bone and Bones/me [Metabolism], Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Colon, Colonic Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Colonic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Energy Transfer, Female, Germany, Half-Life, Humans, Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/me [Metabolism], Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/tu [Therapeutic Use], Kidney, Kidney/me [Metabolism], Knowledge, Linear Energy Transfer, Liver, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Mice, Mice,Nude, Nuclear Medicine, Radiation, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/mt [Methods], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Tissue Distribution, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Yttrium Radioisotopes, Yttrium Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Yttrium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Recent studies suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation may have therapeutic advantages over conventional low-LET (e.g., beta-) emissions. Furthermore, fragments may be more effective in controlling tumor growth than complete IgG. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigators have attempted a direct comparison of the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of a systemic targeted therapeutic strategy, using high-LET alpha versus low-LET beta emitters in vivo. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the toxicity and antitumor efficacy of RIT with the alpha emitter 213Bi/213Po, as compared to the beta emitter 90Y, linked to a monovalent Fab' fragment in a human colonic cancer xenograft model in nude mice. Biodistribution studies of 213Bi- or 88Y-labeled benzyl-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate-conjugated Fab' fragments of the murine monoclonal antibody CO17-1A were performed in nude mice bearing s.c. human colon cancer xenografts. 213Bi was readily obtained from an "in-house" 225Ac/213Bi generator. It decays by beta- and 440-keV gamma emission, with a t(1/2) of 45.6 min, as compared to the ultra-short-lived alpha emitter, 213Po (t(1/2) = 4.2 micros). For therapy, the mice were injected either with 213Bi- or 90Y-labeled CO17-1A Fab', whereas control groups were left untreated or were given a radiolabeled irrelevant control antibody. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each agent was determined. The mice were treated with or without inhibition of the renal accretion of antibody fragments by D-lysine (T. M. Behr et al., Cancer Res., 55: 3825-3834, 1995), bone marrow transplantation, or combinations thereof. Myelotoxicity and potential second-organ toxicities, as well as tumor growth, were monitored at weekly intervals. Additionally, the therapeutic efficacy of both 213Bi- and 90Y-labeled CO17-1A Fab' was compared in a GW-39 model metastatic to the liver of nude mice. In accordance with kidney uptake values of as high as > or = 80% of the injected dose per gram, the kidney was the first dose-limiting organ using both 90Y- and 213Bi-labeled Fab' fragments. Application of D-lysine decreased the renal dose by >3-fold. Accordingly, myelotoxicity became dose limiting with both conjugates. By using lysine protection, the MTD of 90Y-Fab' was 250 microCi and the MTD of 213Bi-Fab' was 700 microCi, corresponding to blood doses of 5-8 Gy. Additional bone marrow transplantation allowed for an increase of the MTD of 90Y-Fab' to 400 microCi and for 213Bi-Fab' to 1100 microCi, respectively. At these very dose levels, no biochemical or histological evidence of renal damage was observed (kidney doses of <35 Gy). At equitoxic dosing, 213Bi-labeled Fab' fragments were significantly more effective than the respective 90Y-labeled conjugates. In the metastatic model, all untreated controls died from rapidly progressing hepatic metastases at 6-8 weeks after tumor inoculation, whereas a histologically confirmed cure was observed in 95% of those animals treated with 700 microCi of 213Bi-Fab' 10 days after model induction, which is in contrast to an only 20% cure rate in mice treated with 250 microCi of 90Y-Fab'. These data show that RIT with alpha emitters may be therapeutically more effective than conventional beta emitters. Surprisingly, maximum tolerated blood doses were, at 5-8 Gy, very similar between high-LET alpha and low-LET beta emitters. Due to its short physical half-life, 213Bi appears to be especially suitable for use in conjunction with fast-clearing fragments

However, the mechanisms underlying these processes are unknown and the relevance to radiotherapy and risk assessment remains controversial. Previous research by our laboratory has shown bystander effects in a human keratinocyte cell line, HPV-G cells, exposed to medium from gamma irradiated HPV-G cells. The aim of this work was to investigate if similar mechanisms to those identified in medium transfer experiments occurred in these HPV-G cells when they are in the vicinity of microbeam irradiated cells. Demonstration of a commonality of mechanisms would support the idea that the process is not artifactual. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPV-G cells were plated as two separate populations on mylar dishes. One population was directly irradiated using a charged particle microbeam (1 - 10 protons). The other population was not irradiated. Bystander factor-induced apoptosis was investigated in both populations following treatment by monitoring the levels of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential using fluorescent probes. Expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2, and cytochrome c were determined, as well as apoptosis levels. RESULTS: Microbeam irradiation induced increases in reactive oxygen species and decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential at 6 h post-exposure, increased expression of bcl-2 and cytochrome c release at 6.5 h and increased apoptosis at 24 h. CONCLUSION: This study shows that similar bystander signalling pathways leading to apoptosis are induced following microbeam irradiation and following medium transfer. This demonstrates that the mechanisms involved are common across different radiation qualities and conditions and indicates that they may be relevant in vivo

Individual proton spectra from the 3-D array of spectra encompassing the lesion showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation necrosis, recurrent or residual tumor, or normal brain. The 1H-MRS imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or recurrent tumor and contrast-enhancing radiation-induced necrosis. Regions of abnormally high choline (Cho) levels, consistent with viable tumor, were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 gliomas. Changes in the serial 1H-MRS imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following treatment. These changes included the significant reduction in Cho levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to necrotic tissue. For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical progression, an increase in Cho levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or necrotic. Several patients showed regional variations in response to brachytherapy as evaluated by 1H-MRS imaging. This study demonstrates the potential of noninvasive 3-D 1H-MRS imaging to discriminate between the formation of contrast-enhancing radiation necrosis and residual or recurrent tumor following brachytherapy. This modality may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to brachytherapy by detecting the presence of abnormnal metabolite levels in nonenhancing regions of solid tumor

(Et4N)2(10)B10H10 was entrapped in 40 nm liposomes coating the monoclonal antibody, MGb 2, against human gastric cancer. There were 1.4 x 10(4) 10B atoms encapsulated and 20 molecules of MGb 2 incorporated per liposomes ELISA indicated that the immunoreactivity of antibodies on liposomes retained 80%. Preferred binding to human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 was observed as many as 15.1 x 10(9) 10B atoms/tumor cell, 38-fold more than that to normal human embryonic lung cell line SL 7. The fluorescent immunoliposome-stained tumor cells showed membrane-fluorescence while SL 7 cells showed no obvious fluorescence. Irradiated with thermal neutrons (0.025 eV, 3.12 x 10(11)n/cm2, gamma-ray 0.84 Gy), 10B-containing immunoliposomes pretreated SGC-7901 cells survived 27%, significantly lower than non-irradiated cells or non-pretreated cells with irradiation (P less than 0.001). The results demonstrated that boron-containing immunoliposomes could bind selectively and deliver sufficient amount of boron-10 to the target tumor cells

Radiation-induced damage to healthy tissue and second malignancies are always a concern, however, when administering radiation. Proton beam radiotherapy, one form of charged particle therapy, allows for excellent dose distributions, with the added benefit of no exit dose. These characteristics make this form of radiotherapy an excellent choice for the treatment of tumours located next to critical structures such as the spinal cord, eyes, and brain, as well as for paediatric malignancies.

A clinical Acuson 128/XP ultrasound scanner was used to image various stationary and moving phantoms while an Elekta SL25 linear accelerator radiotherapy treatment machine was operating. The ultrasound transducer was positioned to image from the outer edge of the treatment field at all times. Images were acquired to videotape and analyzed using in-house motion tracking algorithms to determine the effect of the SL25 on the quality of the displacement measurements. To determine the effect on the dosimetry of the presence of the transducer, dose distributions were examined using thermoluminescent dosimeters loaded into an Alderson Rando phantom and exposed to a 10 x 10 cm2 treatment field with and without the ultrasound transducer mounted 2.5 cm outside the field edge. The ultrasound images acquired a periodic noise that was shown to occur at the pulsing frequency of the treatment machine. Images of moving tissue were analyzed and the standard deviation on the displacement estimates within the tissue was identical with the SL25 on and off. This implies that the periodic noise did not significantly degrade the precision of the tracking algorithm (which was better than 0.01 mm). The presence of the transducer at the surface of the phantom presented only a 2.6% change to the dose distribution to the volume of the phantom. The feasibility of ultrasonic motion tracking during radiotherapy treatment is demonstrated. This presents the possibility of developing a noninvasive, real-time and low-cost method of tracking target motion during a treatment fraction

Frequency of spread to lymph nodes depends on the size of the primary tumor, and thus the extent of radiotherapeutic practical measures can be conformed to the TNM system. A radiation therapy planned in view of the TNM classification may be termed, therefore, as a systematized radiation therapy. From the standpoint of these considerations irradiation techniques using a telecobalt therapy unit and a betatron have been examined considering the application to individual toumor sites and tumor volumes in the regions of the head and neck. The techniques being most appropriate for tumors of the head and neck, with regard to the various sites or volumes, and taking into account the target volume as well as the lymphatic chains concerned are here presented

For intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the "hand calculation" becomes not feasible due to the sophisticated multileaf collimator (MLC) segments created for intensity-modulated dose delivery. Therefore, an independent computerized dose calculation routine is needed for fast and reliable dose verification. In this work, a point dose calculation routine for IMRS/IMRT plan verification is developed by directly applying Clarkson's method. The method includes preparing data table by measuring TPRs for circular fields with diameters ranging 6 to 98 mm, extrapolating TPR for the zero field size (TPR0) from measured data and generating scatter phantom ratio (SPR) for each individual circular field. The segmented MLC sequences created by IMRS/IMRT inverse planning are converted into irregular fields for Clarkson's calculation. This method has been tested using 29 IMRS/IMRT cases. The results indicate that it is reliable, fast, and accurate. The average time to calculate one field is about 2 s with a 300 Mhz CPU	
1797	Dosimetric features of linac head and phantom scattered radiation outside the clinical photon beam: experimental measurements and comparison with treatment planning system calculations	Algorithms, Electrons, Equipment Design, Head, Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Scattering,Radiation, Surface Properties, Switzerland	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dosimetric measurements and treatment planning system (TPS) calculations in the region outside the clinical photon beams have been investigated. The aim was to estimate the calculation accuracy of a specific TPS in areas that are becoming increasingly relevant with the advent of new technologies, such as, for example, intensity modulation radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements were performed on two different linacs to obtain, separately, the head scatter (electrons and photons), the transmission below the jaws and the phantom scatter outside the primary beam for different photon energies, distances from the field edge and field sizes. Calculations with a commercial TPS (Helax TMS) were then obtained and compared with these measurements. RESULTS: In general, reasonable agreement between calculations and measurements was obtained (1-2%), especially for photon scattering (head and phantom). Nevertheless, some discrepancies were found in the electron contamination computation, due probably to the approximations and assumptions made in the TPS calculation algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The analyzed TPS presented good results, but for some particular clinical cases and moreover for advanced techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy, the calculation behaviour with respect to measurements and patient dose delivery should be carefully evaluated

Fast neutrons were proven to be superior to photons for locally extended inoperable salivary gland tumours. The reported overall local control rates are 67% and 24% respectively. Paranasal sinuses and some tumours of the head and neck area, especially extended tumours with large fixed lymph nodes, are also indications for neutrons. By contrast, the results obtained for brain tumours were, in general, disappointing. Neutrons were shown to bring a benefit in the treatment of well differentiated slowly growing soft tissue sarcomas. The reported overall local control rates are 53% and 38% after neutron and photon irradiation respectively. Better results were also reported for bone- and chondrosarcomas. The reported local control rates are 54% for osteosarcomas and 49% for chondrosarcomas after neutron irradiation; the corresponding values are 21% and 33% respectively after photon irradiation. For locally extended prostatic adenocarcinoma, the superiority of mixed schedule (neutrons + photons) was demonstrated by a RTOG randomized trial (local control rates 77% for mixed schedule compared to 31% for photons). Neutrons were also shown to be useful for palliative treatment of melanomas. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the benefit of fast neutrons for other localisations such as cervix, bladder, rectum. It can be concluded that fast neutrons are superior to photons for at least 10% of the radiotherapy patients. It is likely that the new high- energy hospital-based cyclotrons will further extend the indications of neutron therapy. However, patient selection remains one of the main problems and there is a need for development of individual predictive tests. [References: 36]	
4680	[Giant cell tumor of the base of the skull: a report of two cases and review of the literature]. [Review] [91 refs] [French]	Adolescent, Adult, Biopsy, Cobalt, Diagnosis,Differential, Female, France, Giant Cell Tumor of Bone/di [Diagnosis], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Meningioma/di [Diagnosis], Patients, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Skull, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis]	Giant cell tumors of the skull base are rare neoplasms. This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

The studies were carried out preferably with Chinese Hamster cells V79-4 irradiated with different kinds of radiation (gamma-rays, neutrons and carbon ions) using the nucleoid sedimentation technique. Single-strand breaks relax the supercoiled DNA in the subunits resulting in a decreased sedimentation velocity. Rejoining leads to a correct restoration of the structure as can be studied by means of postincubation irradiation. Double-strand breaks release DNA fragments, again leading to an increased sedimentation velocity. If the average number of the induced double-strand breaks per subunit increases to a number higher than one, the measured results suggest that the structures should not be restored completely. The results are compatible with a new repair model developed in our laboratory on the assumption that, firstly, the single DNA subunits are the sensitive target rather than the whole DNA and, secondly, the repair of DNA damage takes place independently in each subunit

Studies to date, conducted primarily on 4.7 T and 1.5 T MR systems, have yielded results unique from conventional T1- and T2-weighted imaging studies. In this study, performed on a 0.1 T device, a section of lower leg was imaged in 20 normal human subjects and one patient with muscular dystrophy, using both a standard 500/22 gradient-echo sequence and a 500/22 gradient-echo sequence combined with off-resonance radio frequency irradiation designed to elicit magnetization transfer contrast. Results of the two techniques were compared. Our findings suggest that magnetization transfer contrast imaging is feasible at 0.1 T, and that this technique allows reproducible tissue characterization and improves contrast between certain tissues

An important component in the treatment planning process is the accurate calculation of dose distributions. The most accurate way to do this is by Monte Carlo calculation of particle transport, first in the geometry of the external or internal source followed by tracking the transport and energy deposition in the tissues of interest. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations allow one to investigate the influence of source components on beams of a particular type and their contaminant particles. Since the mid 1990s, there has been an enormous increase in Monte Carlo studies dealing specifically with the subject of the present review, i.e., external photon beam Monte Carlo calculations, aided by the advent of new codes and fast computers. The foundations for this work were laid from the late 1970s until the early 1990s. In this paper we will review the progress made in this field over the last 25 years. The review will be focused mainly on Monte Carlo modelling of linear accelerator treatment heads but sections will also be devoted to kilovoltage x-ray units and 60Co teletherapy sources.

The hypothesis is presented that a ground-level DNA damage is unavoidable and must be regarding constitutive to a cell. The genotoxic agents responsible for this type of initiation comprise a number of physiological chemists which are known or suspected to be degraded via chemically reactive species, nitrosamines present in the diet or formed from amines in the stomach, ubiquitous carcinogenic metals, UV- and alpha-irradiation, viruses, and other sources in diet and environment. 2. It is concluded that what is normally called spontaneous tumor incidence is partly due to this constitutive DNA damage. 3. Under this assumption, carcinogens can be divided into two classes, the initiating (genotoxic, DNA-damaging) carcinogens and the non-genotoxic carcinogens which act by modulating any of a number of reactions and side reactions that lead to an increase of the constitutive DNA damage or enhance the chance for the constitutive DNA damage to proceed to a tumor. 4. The carcinogenic potency of a carcinogen is described as a product of persistent DNA damage x mutagenicity x non-genotoxic modulation of the DNA damage, and short-term tests are proposed to determine the contributions of the first two parameters to the potency of an initiating carcinogen. 5. As an approximation to this theoretical approach, a correlation is shown of DNA binding in vivo in the form of a "Covalent Binding Index" to the carcinogenic potency as derived from long-term bioassays. An astonishingly good linear correlation is found with an approximate uncertainty of the estimate of a factor of 10 with a total span of values of 10(6). 6. It is concluded that DNA binding in vivo provides a useful first look at the potency of initiating carcinogens but that additional knowledge is required to assess the organ specificity of initiating carcinogens. 7. The non-genotoxic carcinogens seem to be much less potent than the initiating carcinogens if administered alone. They cannot, however, be spotted on the basis of chemical structure, and there is no short-term test which would allow a good quantitative approach to their carcinogenic potency as was demonstrated for the initiating carcinogens. One main reason for this lack is the wide variety of different mechanisms of action of non-genotoxic carcinogens

Technical considerations and results	Aged, Ascites/et [Etiology], Ascites/pc [Prevention & Control], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence/pc [Prevention & Control], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To present technical considerations and results of proton irradiation in a single fraction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with uncontrollable ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

317	A model for the induction of DNA damages by fast neutrons and their evolution into cell clonogenic inactivation	Animals, Anoxia, DNA Damage, DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/me [Metabolism], Fast Neutrons, Hela Cells, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Mice, Mice,Inbred C3H, Models,Biological, Models,Molecular, Neutrons, Nucleic Acid Conformation/re [Radiation Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness	It has been long stated that cellular inactivation through neutron irradiation is mainly caused by energy deposition in DNA molecules from recoiled secondary charged particles. Complexities associated with neutrons, such as the generally broad energy spectrum and the inherently wide energy spectrum of the induced charged particles, not to mention that the dependence of cellular inactivation by charged particles on radiation quality is yet to be fully understood, make it difficult to check this statement. Recently a molecular model has been proposed that improves the quantitative explanation of the dependence of cellular inactivation by charged particles on radiation quality. An attempt was made to apply this model for analysis of neutron cellular inactivation. As a preliminary result it is suggested that neutron cellular inactivation is caused not only by secondary charged particles but also by an "atomic deletion" effect, generated by a stripped atom recoiling from a DNA molecule. This effect seems to be of significant importance, the inactivation cross section of this effect for fission neutrons is as much as 15% (aerobic conditions) or 55% (hypoxic) of the total, and the severity of one occurrence of atomic deletion by a single neutron is estimated as much as 3.1 +/- 1.1 times (aerobic) or 6.8 +/- 1.2 times (hypoxic) higher than the severity of one event by a single track of a charged particle interacting with DNA

This study investigates the photochemistry of those retinoids that may contribute to light-induced damage to the retina. These include retinal (RAL), retinol (ROL), retinylpalmitate (ROLpal) and the protonated Schiff-base of retinal (RALsb). Their photochemistry was followed by both EPR spin-trapping techniques and the direct detection of singlet oxygen via its luminescence at 1270 nm. Irradiation (> 300 nm) of RAL, ROL in methanol (MeOH) or RALpal in dimethylformamide, produces free radicals from both solvents. Illumination of RALsb in MeOH containing NADH with light above 400 nm (and even above 455 nm) generates the superoxide radical. We also determined that the quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization by RAL, ROL or RALpal in MeOH are 0.05, 0.03 and < 0.01, respectively. These values are at least 75% less than those previously found using chemical methods. These observations indicate that a major photochemical process for these retinoids may be an electron (or hydrogen) process that will lead to radical products, and that the singlet oxygen mechanism is of relatively minor importance in protic solvents. These results may explain the action spectra obtained from light-induced damage to the retina	
559	Combined proton beam radiotherapy and transpupillary thermotherapy for large uveal melanomas: a randomized study of 151 patients.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Female, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Informed Consent, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Pupil, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Retinal Detachment/pc [Prevention & Control], Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: Exudation from the tumour scar and glaucoma can be major problems after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma and can sometimes lead to secondary enucleation. We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy. Further studies should be performed to determine whether TTT could be beneficial to smaller tumours and to define its optimal dose. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel	
83	Stereotactic radiosurgery of angiographically occult vascular malformations: 14-year experience	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cerebral Angiography, Cerebral Hemorrhage/di [Diagnosis], Cerebral Hemorrhage/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), Postoperative Complications/di [Diagnosis], Postoperative Complications/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Reoperation, Research, Retrospective Studies	OBJECTIVE: Radiosurgery is generally effective in obliterating true arteriovenous malformations, but less is known about its effects on angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). Since July 1983, 57 patients with surgically inaccessible AOVMs of the brain were treated using helium ion (47 patients) or linear accelerator (10 patients) radiosurgery. This study retrospectively evaluates the response of these AOVMs to treatment. METHODS: All patients presented with previous hemorrhage. The mean patient age was 35.6 years (range, 13-71 yr). The mean AOVM volume was 2.25 cm3 (range, 0.080-15.2 cm3), treated with a mean of 18.0 Gy equivalent (physical dose x relative biological effectiveness, which is 1.3 for helium ion Bragg peak) (range, 7.0-40 Gy equivalent). The Drake scale scores before treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (26 patients), and poor (6 patients). The mean follow-up period was 7.5 years (range, 9 mo-13.8 yr). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (32%) bled symptomatically (20 hemorrhages) after radiosurgery. Sixteen hemorrhages occurred within 36 months after radiosurgery (9.4% annual bleed rate; 16 hemorrhages/171 patient yr); 4 hemorrhages occurred more than 36 months after treatment (1.6% annual bleed rate; 4 hemorrhages/257 patient yr) (P < 0.001). Complications included symptomatic radiation edema (four patients, 7%), necrosis (one patient, 2%), and increased seizure frequency (one patient, 2%). Eight patients underwent surgical resection of their AOVMs 8 to 59 months after radiosurgery because of subsequent hemorrhage. The Drake scale scores after treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (24 patients), poor (3 patients), and dead (5 patients, 3 of whom died as a result of causes unrelated to the AOVMs or radiosurgery). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery may be useful for AOVMs located in surgically inaccessible regions of the brain. A significant decrease in bleed rate exists more than 3 years after treatment compared with the bleed rate within 3 years of treatment. Because current neuroradiological techniques are not able to image obliterative response in these slow-flow vascular lesions, longer term clinical follow-up is required	
2295	Probable causes of recurrence in patients with chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull and cervical spine	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Cervical Vertebrae, Chondrosarcoma/ep [Epidemiology], Chondrosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Chordoma/ep [Epidemiology], Chordoma/ra [Radiography], Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/et [Etiology], Optic Chiasm, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Spinal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Spinal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography]	PURPOSE: 141 patients with chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull and cervical spine were treated with proton and photon irradiation between 1980 and 1989. The local disease was controlled in 111 of these patients. This study reviews the 26 patients who have had their disease recur, and who have evaluable diagnostic studies to examine for probable causes of recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The histologies of the recurrent tumors were 21 non-chondroid chordomas, two chondroid chordomas, and three chondrosarcomas. The prescribed doses ranged from 67 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 72 CGE (average of 69 CGE). Doses to small regions of the tumor were deliberately reduced where they abutted certain normal tissues (brain stem, spinal cord, optic chiasm, and optic nerves) in order to keep these structures at acceptance dose levels. The first study, CT or MR scan, on which there was evidence of increase in tumor was carefully evaluated and that volume transferred to the CT scan on which the treatment plan had been developed. The 3D dose distribution in the region of recurrence was carefully analyzed and a judgement made as to the most probable cause of recurrence. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter (6 of 26) of the cases failed in the prescribed dose region. More than half (15 of 26) failed in regions where tumor dose was limited by normal tissue constraints. Approximately 10% of the patients recurred in the surgical pathway and 10% were judged to be marginal misses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 75% of the patients failed in regions receiving less than the prescribed dose. All tumors which failed in the high dose region had volume greater than 75 cc. Patients with cervical spine disease had a higher rate of recurrence (10 or 26) and larger tumors (average volume of 102 cc) than those with base of skull disease (16 of 115) with an average volume of 63 cc	
2035	Treatment of macular degeneration with proton beams	California, Cobalt, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Eye, Humans, Immobilization, Light, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Silver, Technology,Radiologic, Time, United States, Universities, Visual Acuity	Subfoveal neovascular membranes (SNVMs) are a leading cause of severe visual loss in the elderly in the United States. Previously, the only treatment that could halt progression of this disease was laser photocoagulation, which was, however, accompanied by immediate reduction in visual acuity. A single narrow proton beam was used to irradiate 45 patients to either 8 or 14 Cobalt Gray Equivalent. The alignment technique and dosimetry of these treatments are described. The proton beam direction, range, and modulation were planned with the assistance of an eye-specific planning program. A single anterior beam was used, with patients looking nasally toward a blinking fixation light at an angle of 30 degrees. Patients were aligned using a light field projected through a slit collimator. Patients' positions were monitored during treatment with a short-focal-length camera. Depth dose in a flat phantom was measured with a small-diameter parallel plate ionization chamber. Lateral profiles were measured at several depths with silver halide film. Each treatment session lasted 15 min, of which 1 min consisted of beam delivery. The proton beam stopped in the orbital cavity, delivering no primary proton dose to the brain. Dose to the center of the lens of the involved eye was less than 0.5% of the dose delivered to the macula. Treatments of SNVMs with proton beams require only a short visit to the hospital, little immobilization effort, and a minimal amount of treatment room and beam time. Compared to previous treatment trials using x-ray beams, the dose to nonocular tissues is reduced significantly

As early as 1962 UNSCEAR estimated the doubling dose (a dose causing as many mutations as those occurring spontaneously during one generation) at 1 Gy for cases of exposure to ionizing radiations with low LET at a low dose rate and this value was confirmed in the next UNSCEAR reports up to now. For cases of acute irradiation the doubling dose was estimated at 0.3-0.4 Gy for the period under review. The paper considers the evolution of the concepts of human natural hereditary variability which is a basis for assessing the risk of exposure by the doubling dose method. The level of human natural genetic variability per 1,000,000 newborns is estimated at 738,000 hereditary diseases including mendelian, chromosomal and multifactorial ones. The greatest difficulties in assessing the doubling dose value were found to occur in the case of multifactorial diseases the phenotypical expression of which depends on mutational events in polygenic systems and on numerous environmental factors. The introduction in calculations of the potential recoverability correction factor (PRCF) made it possible to assess the genetic risk taking into account this class of hereditary diseased. The current estimate of genetic risk is 3000-4700 genetic diseases in the first generation per 1,000,000 newborns after exposure of the parental generation to 1 Gy at low dose rate. A certain part of genetic changes after exposure of the parental generation to radiation will express themselves in the second generation, in grandchildren (1150-3200 cases or 56% of the effect predicted for the first generation), and in succeeding generations	
1751	Induction and rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks in normal human skin fibroblasts after exposure to radiation of different linear energy transfer: possible roles of track structure and chromatin organization	Chromatin/ch [Chemistry], DNA Damage, DNA Fragmentation, DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/me [Metabolism], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Energy Transfer, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Ions, Kinetics, Linear Energy Transfer, Nitrogen, Protein Conformation, Radiation, Research, Skin/cy [Cytology], Skin/me [Metabolism], Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Sweden, Universities	DNA double-strand breaks are nonrandomly induced by high-LET radiation. Differences in the induction and rejoining of DSBs after irradiation with ions having different LET were detected by fragment analysis. The data obtained indicate that the track structure of the traversing particle and its interaction with the different chromatin structures of the cellular DNA influence the yield as well as the distribution of the induced damage. The induction and rejoining of clustered DSBs induced by the same nitrogen ion fluence at LETs of 80-225 keV/microm were investigated by a detailed analysis of the DNA fragmentation patterns in normal human fibroblasts. The DSBs in the cells were allowed to rejoin during incubations for 0-20 h. Two separate pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols were used, optimized for separation of fragments in the size ranges 1-6 Mbp and 5 kbp-1.5 Mbp. A strong influence of LET on the level of DSB induction was evident. The DSB yield increased from 4.5 +/- 0.2 to 10.0 +/- 0.3 DSBs per particle traversal through the cell nucleus when LET increased from 80 to 225 keV/microm. Further, the size distribution of the DNA fragments showed a significant dependence on radiation quality, with an excess of fragments at 50-200 kbp and around 1 Mbp. Differences in repair kinetics were also evident, with slower rejoining for increasing LET, and the initial nonrandom fragment distributions were still present after 1 h of repair

Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation in a single or limited number of fractions to a lesion while maintaining delivery of a low dose to adjacent normal structures. METHODS: Image-guided radiosurgery was developed by coupling an orthogonal pair of real-time x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator that guides the radiation beam to treatment sites associated with radiographic landmarks. This procedure can be conducted in an outpatient setting without the use of framebased skeletal fixation. The system relies on skeletal landmarks or implanted fiducial markers to locate treatment targets. Four patients with spinal metastases underwent radiosurgery with total prescription doses of 1000 to 1600 cGy in one or two fractions. Alignment of the treatment dose with the target volume was accurate to within 1.5 mm. During the course of each treatment fraction, patient movement was less than 0.5 mm on average. Dosimetry was highly conformal, with a demonstrated ability to deliver 1600 cGy to the perimeter of an irregular target volume while keeping exposure to the cord itself below 800 cGy. CONCLUSIONS: These experiences indicate that frameless radiosurgery is a viable therapeutic option for metastatic spine disease	
2844	Alterations in the progression of cells through the cell cycle after exposure to alpha particles or gamma rays	Alpha Particles, Bromodeoxyuridine/me [Metabolism], Cell Cycle, Cell Cycle/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, Cyclins/me [Metabolism], DNA Damage, DNA Replication/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/cy [Cytology], Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Flow Cytometry, G1 Phase, G1 Phase/re [Radiation Effects], G2 Phase, Gamma Rays, Humans, Radiation Tolerance, Radiobiology, Research, Skin, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/me [Metabolism]	A G1-phase delay after exposure to alpha particles has not been report ed previously, perhaps because immortalized cell lines or cell lines from tumor cells were used in past studies. Therefore, we compared the effects of alpha particles (0.19 or 0.57 Gy) and approximately equitoxic doses of gamma rays (2 or 4 Gy) on progression of cells through the cell cycle in normal human skin fibroblasts. Cell cycle analyses were performed using flow cytometry by measuring incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in each phase of the cell cycle up to 44 h after irradiation. We observed an alpha-particle-induced G1-phase delay in human skin fibroblasts even at the lowest dose, 0.19 Gy. At equitoxic doses, more pronounced and persistent G1-phase delays and arrests were observed in gamma-irradiated cultures in that increased fractions of the G1-phase cells remained BrdUrd- over the course of the study after gamma-ray exposure compared to cells exposed to alpha particles. In addition, G1-phase cells that became BrdUrd+ after gamma irradiation re-arrested in G1 phase, whereas BrdUrd+ G1-phase cells in alpha-particle-irradiated cultures continued cycling. In contrast, comparable percentages of cells were delayed in G2 phase after either alpha-particle or gamma irradiation. Both gamma and alpha-particle irradiation caused increases in cellular p53 and p2lCip1 shortly after the exposures, which suggests that the G1-phase delay that occurs in response to alpha-particle irradiation is dependent on p53 like the initial G1-phase delay induced by gamma rays	
2391	Scatter factors for a 25-MV x-ray beam	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation, Uncertainty, Universities, X-Rays	The scatter factors, i.e., the ratios between the primary and scatter components of absorbed dose, have been determined for a 25-MV x-ray beam. The primary dose is described by attenuation and head-scatter factors. The attenuation coefficient decreased from 0.028 cm-1 at the surface to 0.025 cm-1 at 30 cm depth. The head-scatter factor varied about 8% for collimator settings from 5 x 5 to 40 x 40 cm2. To determine the scatter factors, measured tissue-output ratios were divided by the attenuation and head-scatter factors for the same depth and field size. The results were fitted, with agreement within +/- 1%, to a model which assumes a linear relation between the scatter factor and the field size if the ratio between field size and depth is constant. The model requires transient electron equilibrium, which is present when the depth exceeds 6 cm and the field size 6 x 6 cm2. The scatter factor increases to 1.33 at 30-cm depth and 40 x 40 cm2 field size. The peak scatter factor (PSF) at 3.5-cm depth reaches 1.06 for the largest field. Both PSF and NPSF, the normalized peak scatter factor, are affected by electron disequilibrium, which causes some conceptual ambiguities and numerical uncertainties	
4747	Effect of beamlet step-size on IMRT plan quality	Algorithms, Humans, Jaw, Maryland, Models,Statistical, Numerical Analysis,Computer-Assisted, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Travel, Universities	We have studied the degree to which beamlet step-size impacts the quality of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans. Treatment planning for IMRT begins with the application of a grid that divides each beam's-eye-view of the target into a number of smaller beamlets (pencil beams) of radiation. The total dose is computed as a weighted sum of the dose delivered by the individual beamlets. The width of each beamlet is set to match the width of the corresponding leaf of the multileaf collimator (MLC). The length of each beamlet (beamlet step-size) is parallel to the direction of leaf travel. The beamlet step-size represents the minimum stepping distance of the leaves of the MLC and is typically predetermined by the treatment planning system. This selection imposes an artificial constraint because the leaves of the MLC and the jaws can both move continuously. Removing the constraint can potentially improve the IMRT plan quality. In this study, the optimized results were achieved using an aperture-based inverse planning technique called direct aperture optimization (DAO). We have tested the relationship between pencil beam step-size and plan quality using the American College of Radiology's IMRT test case. For this case, a series of IMRT treatment plans were produced using beamlet step-sizes of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm. Continuous improvements were seen with each reduction in beamlet step size. The maximum dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was reduced from 134.7% to 121.5% and the mean dose to the organ at risk (OAR) was reduced from 38.5% to 28.2% as the beamlet step-size was reduced from 10 to 1 mm. The smaller pencil beam sizes also led to steeper dose gradients at the junction between the target and the critical structure with gradients of 6.0, 7.6, 8.7, and 9.1 dose%/mm achieved for beamlet step sizes of 10, 5, 2, and 1 mm, respectively	
1173	Combination treatment with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin and acute irradiation produces supra-additive growth suppression in human prostate carcinoma spheroids	Benzoquinones, Cell Cycle, Cell Division/de [Drug Effects], Cell Division/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Cell Line,Tumor, Combined Modality Therapy, Disease Progression, Energy Transfer, Heat, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Lactams,Macrocyclic, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Research, Rifabutin/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Rifabutin/pd [Pharmacology], Spheroids,Cellular	Failure to control localized prostate cancer can result not only in localized disease progression but also distant metastatic spread. Whereas significant advances in both surgical technique and radiation therapy have improved local control rates with decreased morbidity, consistent long-term control remains elusive. This study investigates the potential of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin (17AAG), a geldanamycin derivative, to sensitize tumor cells to ionizing radiation, permitting a significant improvement to targeted radiotherapies of prostate carcinoma. As a monotherapeutic, 17AAG functions to modulate the action of heat shock protein 90, ultimately affecting a multitude of cellular signaling pathways. It is in Phase I trial and has shown promise in controlling prostate cancer progression. Human prostate tumor cells (LNCaP and CWR22Rv1) were grown as spheroids and incubated for 96 h with increasing doses of 17AAG immediately before and after 2 or 6 Gy low linear energy transfer (LET), high dose-rate irradiation (Cs-137 irradiator). Twelve or 24 spheroids (initial diameter, 150-200 microm) were used per experiment. Response was determined by spheroid volume measurements taken over at least 40 days, after treatment. Incubation of either cell line with 17AAG (<or=1000 nM) or irradiation (<or=6 Gy) alone resulted in transient median growth delays ranging from 2 to 9 days (relative to controls). Combining treatments produced dose- and cell line-dependent supra-additive responses. For LNCaP spheroids, the combination of 2 Gy and 100 nM 17AAG resulted in growth delays additive of the treatments individually; however, increasing either the radiation to 6 Gy or the 17AAG concentration to 1000 nM led to synergistic interactions. Similarly, synergy was noted in CWR22Rv1 studies at only 6 Gy and 1000 nM 17AAG. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Ki67 staining of spheroid sections revealed the increased growth control to be a function of spheroids failing to re-enter the cell cycle. For all 6 Gy experiments, cells remaining from each of the spheroids that failed to regrow were transferred to adherent dishes to evaluate clonogenicity; growth-controlled spheroids also failed to form colonies within 2 weeks of being plated. These results suggest that significant gains in treatment effectiveness may be obtained by combining these treatment modalities, warranting additional preclinical investigation	
722	Comparative treatment planning on localized prostate carcinoma conformal photon- versus proton-based radiotherapy	Femur/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To assess the potential benefit of proton-beam therapy in comparison to 3-D conformal photon therapy and photon- based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma for various stages of disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies	
64	Proton-beam irradiation of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes in presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome: a case report	Adult, Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Eye Infections,Fungal/co [Complications], Eye Infections,Fungal/di [Diagnosis], Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Fovea Centralis/pa [Pathology], Fundus Oculi, Histoplasmosis/co [Complications], Histoplasmosis/di [Diagnosis], Humans, Neovascularization,Pathologic/di [Diagnosis], Neovascularization,Pathologic/mi [Microbiology], Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Syndrome, United States, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) refers to a choroidopathy that is characterized by the presence of multiple peripheral atrophic chorioretinal scars, peri-papillary atrophy, and choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM), usually in or adjacent to the fovea. In the United States, POHS is an important cause of loss of central visual acuity in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years. A number of treatment options for subfoveal and juxtafoveal CNVMs in POHS have been under investigation, including laser photocoagulation, surgical excision of the CNVM, and radiation therapy. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old women was referred to our office reporting decreased depth perception and finger-counting vision in the right eye for the duration of 1 month. A diagnosis of POHS with subfoveal CNVM was made and the patient was referred for an experimental protocol of proton-beam irradiation. Four months after her initial visit, the patient returned, reporting blurry vision with a blind spot in her left eye. A subfoveal CNVM in the left eye was subsequently treated with irradiation as well. Seven months after the initial treatment, visual acuities were 20/20 in each treated eye. CONCLUSION: Although is currently an experimental procedure, proton-beam irradiation appears to be a promising treatment for subfoveal CNVM in patients with POHS

[Japanese]	Brachytherapy, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Informed Consent, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Male, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Quality of Life, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Relative Biological Effectiveness	Radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer has been developing dramatically during the past 10 years in Japan as well as in USA. There are several ways to treat prostate cancer by RT. As for external-beam RT (EBRT), a more sophisticated technique beyond 3-dimensional conformal RT called intensity modulated RT was developed and has been in use in many Japanese RT centers. It can raise the total radiation dose and is expected to increase the biochemical control rate. As for brachytherapy, a low-dose-rate seed implant using iodine-125 was initiated in 2003 and has become widespread throughout Japan in only a few years. High-dose-rate brachytherapy using iridium-19 2 has also been used in more advanced cases combined with EBRT. Brachytherapy offers an ideal RT dose concentration and can avoid rectal complications. As for particle therapy, we have carbon and proton in several institutions in Japan. Particles have the merit of good dose distributions and for carbons, relative biological effectiveness. Furthermore, some centers are considering the stereotactic hypofractionated RT due to the relatively low alfa-beta ratio of prostate cancer. Recent reports showed that after a certain period of followup, the biochemical control rate was similar either with external beam high-quality RT, brachytherapy, heavy ion RT and surgery. Therefore, the choice of treatment should depend on the adverse effects, quality of life, medical costs, and the lifestyle of the patient. The merits and demerits of each treatment modality were discussed. Longer follow-up is still necessary and informed consent is mandatory when choosing a treatment modality	
3457	The choice of treatment after incomplete adenomectomy in acromegaly: proton--versus high voltage radiation	Acromegaly/bl [Blood], Acromegaly/rt [Radiotherapy], Acromegaly/su [Surgery], Adenoma,Acidophil/bl [Blood], Adenoma,Acidophil/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenoma,Acidophil/su [Surgery], Adult, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Combined Modality Therapy, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Growth Hormone/bl [Blood], Humans, Methods, Pituitary Gland,Anterior/su [Surgery], Pituitary Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Protons, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Universities	The authors report the results of a study designed to compare the effectiveness of two different types of radiation in patients with acromegaly where surgical therapy had failed to normalize growth hormone (GH). Longterm follow-up after conventional high voltage radiation in 17 patients and proton therapy in 13 patients confirmed a similar reduction of GH levels in both groups. After 4.5 years a decrease of about 80% was achieved. After "conventional radiation" GH was normal in 8 (47%) and near normal in 6 (35%) while proton therapy resulted in normalization in 5 and improvement in 5 (38%). The slightly better results of "conventional radiation" must be attributed to lower pretreatment levels of GH. Side effects as additional pituitary deficits and oculomotor palsies were more often seen after proton treatment. Since the results of both radiation methods are similar and proton therapy has a tendency to more serious side effects we recommend "conventional radiation" as secondary treatment of acromegaly	
962	Inherent smoothness of intensity patterns for intensity modulated radiation therapy generated by simultaneous projection algorithms	Algorithms, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Models,Theoretical, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research	The efficient delivery of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) depends on finding optimized beam intensity patterns that produce dose distributions, which meet given constraints for the tumour as well as any critical organs to be spared. Many optimization algorithms that are used for beamlet-based inverse planning are susceptible to large variations of neighbouring intensities. Accurately delivering an intensity pattern with a large number of extrema can prove impossible given the mechanical limitations of standard multileaf collimator (MLC) delivery systems. In this study, we apply Cimmino's simultaneous projection algorithm to the beamlet-based inverse planning problem, modelled mathematically as a system of linear inequalities. We show that using this method allows us to arrive at a smoother intensity pattern. Including nonlinear terms in the simultaneous projection algorithm to deal with dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints does not compromise this property from our experimental observation. The smoothness properties are compared with those from other optimization algorithms which include simulated annealing and the gradient descent method. The simultaneous property of these algorithms is ideally suited to parallel computing technologies	
1167	[Radiation therapy in the treatment of lung cancer]. [Review] [34 refs] [Japanese]	Aged, Brachytherapy, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Cranial Irradiation, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Respiration, Survival, Survival Rate	Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has the potential for cure with surgical resection, unfortunately less than 15% of all patients and less than 25% of those who present with intrathoracic localized disease are candidates for curative surgical resection. Elderly patients, even if they have resectable disease, often have medical contraindications to surgery, such as cardiovascular disease or pulmonary dysfunction. Radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer has been practiced as (1) curative thoracic irradiation for inoperable or unresectable NSCLC, (2) preoperative and postoperative irradiation, (3) thoracic irradiation for limited-stage small cell lung cancer(SCLC), (4) prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for SCLC, and (5) palliative irradiation for more advanced disease. Recent evidence indicates that RT with high equivalent doses of 60 Gy or more using conventional once daily fractionation may improve the survival rate for patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC when combined with cisplatin-based chemotherapy or administered by altered fractionation. In limited-stage SCLC, the additions of thoracic RT and prophylactic cranial irradiation to systemic chemotherapy have also improved disease control. In patients with more advanced disease, RT has provided relief of symptoms. Newer radiotherapeutic methods are expected to hold promise in increasing the dose to tumor while sparing normal tissue. Recently, heavy ion charged particle therapy, brachytherapy, stereotactic irradiation, and multi-daily fractionation have shown promise in the treatment of lung cancer. Furthermore, there have been advances in the technology for treatment delivery, especially three-dimensional treatment planning systems, patient fixation tools, and respiration synchronous systems for RT.

Med. Biol. 42 1737-49) have demonstrated that the concept of a scatter-plane source can accurately describe head scatter in irregularly shaped fields produced by the MLC of an Elekta linear accelerator. In these linacs, the solid jaw is below the MLC set and plays no part on defining the view of the main source of head scatter, the flattening filter. A more complicated situation arises for linear accelerator head designs which incorporate a solid upper jaw pair with the MLC jaws further from the source. Application of the Hounsell and Wilkinson technique to these accelerator designs does not achieve the accuracy in the Elekta application. We present a generalized extension to Hounsell and Wilkinson's model and present results for typical treatment field shapes on a Siemens Primus linear accelerator

We approximated body tissues to mixtures of muscle, air, fat and bone. Consequently, the relationship can be calibrated only with a CT scan of their substitutes, for which we chose water, air, ethanol and potassium phosphate solution, respectively. With simple and specific corrections for non-equivalencies of the substitutes, a calibration accuracy of 1% will be achieved. We tested the calibration method with some biological materials to verify that the proposed method would offer the accuracy, simplicity and specificity required for a standard in radiotherapy treatment planning, in particular with heavy charged particles	
4512	On-axis and off-axis primary dose component in high energy photon beams	France, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, Scattering,Radiation, X-Rays	The depth dose of the primary dose component, on axis and off axis of six different x-ray beams, has been determined from transmission measurements in narrow beam geometry with and without flattening filter using a Perspex column of a cross section large enough to ensure electronic equilibrium. In order to derive the primary photon fluence, a correction for the scatter from the column has been applied according to the following method: A number of spectra taken from the literature have been used for computing a scatter coefficient Sc at different depths by convolution of dose spread arrays. Using the relationship between Sc and the single attenuation coefficient mu i to represent each entire spectrum, it has been possible to correct the experimental transmission curves iteratively, until the corresponding values of mu were stabilized and representative of the primary. The measured attenuation coefficients were found to have a linear increase as a function of the distance from the central axis for all the energies and types of linear accelerators. For the same nominal energy, this increase is different from one accelerator to another. The same phenomenon was observed for the attenuation coefficients obtained without the flattening filter in the same experimental conditions. The results are tentatively interpreted considering the angular variation of bremsstrahlung energy spectra with and without a flattening filter as calculated by a Monte Carlo method and they are consistent and useful to take accurately into account the softening of the beam as the off-axis distance increases

[Review] [28 refs]	Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/th [Therapy], Humans, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Base Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Our purpose was to discuss the optimal treatment and outcomes for patients with skull base chordomas. METHODS: We reviewed the pertinent literature for this study. RESULTS: Skull base chordomas usually arise in the clivus and are rarely completely resectable. Therefore, most are treated with radiotherapy (RT). Because of the risk of severe late complications, the dose is often limited with conventional photon RT, and the probability of cure is low. Proton RT alone or combined with photon RT (proton/photon RT) offers the advantage of improved dose distribution and the ability to treat the tumor to a higher dose without exceeding normal tissue tolerance. The 10-year local control rate after proton/photon RT is approximately 40% to 50%. The probability of local control is related to minimum tumor dose and dose inhomogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Skull base chordoma is a rare neoplasm that is rarely cured after surgery alone or combined with conventional RT. Proton/photon RT offers the advantage of increasing the tumor dose while minimizing the dose to normal tissues, thus reducing the risk of late complications. The optimal treatment may be photon/proton RT alone or combined with a gross total resection, when feasible. 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. [References: 28]

In the present study, we show that a single, 30 cGy dose of 150 keV/micrometer 4He ions can malignantly transform human papillomavirus immortalized human bronchial epithelial [BEP2D] cells. Transformed cells produce progressively growing tumors in nude mice. The transformation frequency by the single dose of alpha particles is estimated to be approximately 4 X 10(-7). Based on the average cross-sectional area of BEP2D cells, it can be calculated that a mean traversal of 1.4 particles per cell is sufficient to induce tumorigenic conversion of these cells 3 to 4 months post-irradiation. Tumorigenic BEP2D cells overexpress mutated p53 tumor suppressor oncoproteins in addition to the cell cycle control gene cyclin D1 and D2. This model provides an opportunity to study the cellular and molecular changes at the various stages in radiation carcinogenesis involving human cells

Those parameters are influenced by different physical beam properties, by the type of beam delivery device and by the way the dose is delivered. Conformity and selectivity should be evaluated for each treatment with the help of some specific indices, i.e. target volume ratio and normal volume ratio based on the dose-volume histograms

New treatment methods may improve the therapeutic ratio either by increasing the frequency of tumor control or lessening the treatment-related morbidity, or both. There are several physical and biological reasons why particle radiation therapy may increase tumor cell killing without increasing normal tissue sequelae. After preliminary basic research, clinical trials of fast neutron and proton teletherapy were started. Over 700 patients were treated with fast neutron beams in 3 U.S. research programs. These studies will be extended to include negative pi mesons and heavy particles

Using this method, the responses of Q tumor cells as well as total tumor (P + Q) cells within murine solid tumors to various DNA-damaging treatments were evaluated. Based on this evaluation, combining with tirapazamine, a well-known bioreductive agent, and/or heat treatment at mild temperatures was thought to be a promising modality for cancer therapy in terms of conventional anticancer treatment-resistant Q cell control. Recently, our method for detecting the Q-cell response using P cell labeling with BrdU and the MN frequency assay was also shown to be applicable to an apoptosis detection assay. Meanwhile, our method for detecting the intratumor Q-cell response was also applicable toward high linear energy transfer radiation, including reactor neutrons. Thus, using our method, a new neutron capture compound that has the potential to be distributed in neutron capture therapy-resistant intratumor Q cell populations is now under development

A high alpha 1-antitrypsin level and a normal alpha 2-macroglobulin level were found in all the breast cancer patients. An increase in both blood serum inhibitors was detected in hypophyseal adenoma. The dependence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin content on a subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spread was revealed in the course of 2 years following "hypophysectomy" in the patients with disseminated breast cancer. In the hypophyseal adenoma patients the activity of both inhibitors returned to normal 1 year after treatment and remained within normal during 3 years of follow-up. It was regarded as a positive therapeutic effect. The above findings make it possible to propose the determination of the activity af alpha 1-antitrypsin in breast cancer and alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in hypophyseal adenoma as an additional test for the evaluation of the results of proton "hypophysectomy"	
3884	Small-field electron dosimetry for the Philips SL25 linear accelerator	Electrons, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Technology,Radiologic, Uncertainty	Electron-beam characteristics of a Philips SL25 linear accelerator have been studied. Central-axis percentage depth doses, cross-beam profiles and beam output factors of 6-, 10-, and 20-MeV beams, selected from the available energy range of 4 to 22 MeV, are reported in this paper. The main thrust of this work is to determine the systematic variation of beam characteristics, especially the output factor, with standard cone sizes and cerrobend beam-shaping cutouts down to a field size of 2 X 2 cm Output factors for the standard cones (open field) are energy dependent in a complex manner, increasing with the cone size for the 6-MeV beam whereas decreasing for 10- and 20-MeV beams. The output factor falls below unity at lower energies (6 and 10 MeV) for fields with at least one side smaller than 6 cm, and stays nearly constant for the 20-MeV beam. Measured output factors of small fields are least squares fitted by a second-order polynomial function. Output factors for small rectangular fields have been derived from the one-dimensional and square-root formulas, and the equivalent-square method. Only the one-dimensional formula predicts the measured output factors of highly elongated fields to within +/- 1% experimental uncertainties. Different cones with the same size electron cutout show a varied dose response, primarily due to variation in scattered electron contamination from the cones	
4707	1H-NMR evidence for a different response to the same dose (2 Gy) of ionizing radiation of MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells and three-dimensional spheroids	Alanine, Bone Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Bone Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cell Death, Cell Growth Processes/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Cell Line,Tumor, DNA, DNA Fragmentation, Glutathione/me [Metabolism], Humans, Inositol/me [Metabolism], Italy, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/me [Metabolism], Lipid Metabolism/re [Radiation Effects], Lipids, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,Biomolecular/mt [Methods], Osteosarcoma/me [Metabolism], Osteosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Research, Spheroids,Cellular	High resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy was used to examine the response of the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line grown in monolayer and as 3-dimensional tumor spheroids to the same low dose (2 Gy) of ionizing radiation. The MG-63 cells and spheroids were irradiated at 24 h of growth and the 1H-NMR spectra of whole control and irradiated monolayer cells and of whole control and irradiated multicellular spheroids collected after another 24 h were compared. The 1H-NMR spectra of the perchloric acid extracts as well as the 2-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra of both pairs of cell systems were also obtained. Possible radiation-induced cell damage was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and variations in cell growth, while cell death was evaluated by chromatin dye Hoechst staining and DNA fragmentation assays. The results demonstrated that no cell damage took place, but that significant variations in numerous metabolites occured in both the monolayer cells and the spheroids after irradiation. Most of the changes observed were very similar in nature. In fact, significant increases in lactate, alanine, creatine and phosphocreatine and choline-containing metabolites and a significant decrease in glutathione (GSH) were observed in both cells and spheroids. However, while significant increases in CH2 and CH3 mobile lipids, glutamine/glutamate, taurine and inositol were seen in the spheroids, no variations in CH2 or CH3 lipids, glutamine/glutamate or taurine were recorded in the MG-63 cells grown in monolayer after irradiation. In addition, a significant decrease rather than a significant increase in inositol was also noted in the monolayer cells. The data presented seem to suggest that, although neither monolayer cells nor spheroids show apparent signs of damage after exposure to the same dose of ionizing radiation, very different cell death responses as well as very diverse antioxidant/osmoregulatory reactions were triggered by this stressing agent	
3407	Influence of microdosimetric quantities on observed dose-response relationships in radiation therapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Photons, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Sweden, Weights and Measures	The steepness of dose-response curves in radiation therapy depends to a large extent on the statistics of cell killing. This is so if the last few clonogenic tumor cells have to be hit or eradicated by other means to cure the patient. The steepness is dependent on the number of clonogenic cells in the tumor and the possible variation in their sensitivity. However, the uniformity of the dose distribution is also important and a decreased slope may result when the delivery of the dose is nonuniform or statistically uncertain. The variance in the energy imparted at the microdosimetric level to individual cell nuclei constitutes the ultimate limit of the variance in delivered dose at a given mean tumor dose. Considering all dosimetric variances it is shown that for low-LET beams the conventional microdosimetric variance will dominate, while in neutron and high-LET beams in general the microdosimetric variance may contribute significantly to the observed dose-response relationship. As a result the normalized slope of the dose-response curve for tumor control and normal tissue complications with neutrons and other high-LET beams will be reduced compared to that with photons. This conclusion is found to be in quantitative agreement with available data from clinical trials with neutron therapy. Finally, it is pointed out that for beams with a very high RBE and LET it may be favorable to deliver a fraction of the total dose in the form of conventional low-LET radiation. This addition of low-LET radiation may be desirable to ensure a dose to all clonogenic tumor cell nuclei that is sufficiently high and uniform to achieve a high probability of tumor control

A large number of studies focus on the following aspects of the biological effects of high-LET radiation: (i) basic understanding of radiation damage and repair; (ii) developing radiotherapy protocols for accelerated charged particles; and (iii) estimation of human risks from exposure to high-LET heavy charged particles. The increased lethal effectiveness (cell inactivation) of high-LET radiation contributes to new methods for using radiation therapy, but it is also necessary to study the enhanced mutagenic effect of high LET radiation, because higher frequencies of mutation can be expected to provide higher rates of carcinogenicity with human exposure. It is important to note that both measures of biological effectiveness (lethality and mutagenicity) depend on the quality of radiation, the dose, dose-rate effects, and the biological endpoints studied. This paper is intended to provide a review of current research on the mutagenic effects of high-LET radiation, and is organized into three sections. First, are descriptions of the induced mutations studied with various detection systems (section 1) because the detectable mutations induced by ionizing radiation, including heavy-ions, depend largely on the detection system used. Second is a discussion of the biological significance of the dependence of induced mutations on LET (section 2). This is related to the molecular nature of radiation lesions and to the repair mechanisms used to help cells recover from such damage. Finally, applications of mutation detection systems for studies in space (section 3) are described, in which the carcinogenic effects of space environmental radiation are considered.

Unique r.b.e. values were obtained for inactivation and mutation induction with nine different qualities of radiation. The plot of r.b.e. verus LET gave humped curves for both endpoints; r.b.e. maxima were in the LET range 90--200 keV micrometer-1 but the maximum r.b.e. value for mutation induction was almost twice that for inactivation. The accuracy of estimates of mutation induction are discussed with regard to possible selective effects against mutants during post-irradiation growth

1911	Preliminary safety evaluation of a cyclotron facility for positron emission tomography imaging	Cyclotrons, Facility Design and Construction, Fluorine Radioisotopes, Humans, Nitrogen, Nitrogen Radioisotopes, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring, Radiation Protection, Radioisotopes, Safety, Safety Management, Spain, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Universities	This work describes the design characteristics of a medical imaging centre which uses positron emission tomography, with a cyclotron for fluorine-18 and nitrogen-13 production, and which has provided experimental information on operational data recorded by area dosimetry since 1995. Doses to radiopharmacy and medical staff have been measured both in normal work and in some handling incidents. Data on radiation levels in the installation have also been obtained and related to design details and shielding. Area dosimetry was carried out using a five-stationary detector network, with a sampling rate of 2 min(-1), and by thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD). Staff were also monitored by TLD, using extra chips for finger dosimetry and to duplicate individual whole-body dosimetry in order to measure doses in certain single operations. For normal work, average whole-body doses to radiopharmacy staff were between 0.03 and 0.28 mSv/month, wrist doses were between 0.42 and 2.67 mSv/month, and finger doses were between 1.4 and 7.7 mSv/day for the left hand and 0.8 and 2.4 mSv/day for the right hand; such variation reflects the differing expertise of staff and the role played by optimisation. Finger doses between 16 and 131 mSv were measured in handling incidents, and finger doses of 20.2 and 20.7 mSv for the left hand and 22.0 and 22.3 mSv for the right hand were measured during handling of a syringe without shielding, containing 3 GBq. For medical staff, contributions to the whole-body dose of 2.0 and 1.9 microSv/procedure were measured for injection and placing the patient on the examination couch, respectively. Dose measurement on the middle finger of the right hand gives an average of 70 microSv during the injection. The provisions regarding the shielding design have proved to be adequate and effective during a 3-year operational period. Operational doses to medical staff are comparatively low, while radiopharmacy staff are the most exposed. The finger doses in these professionals may exceed the annual limit, unless operational restrictions in daily practice are adopted. On-line area dosimetry records based on dose rate probes have proved to be effective both for monitoring radiation levels during the operation and for detecting changes in the behaviour of the facility in the irradiation process

It incorporates a PDP-11/05 computer for beam control, treatment-factor input, and beam shutdown in the event of failure of the system. The performance of the unit has not been hindered by computer or software malfunction, and the computer has provided an excellent means for preventive maintenance and repair. Dosimetry parameters are similar to other 6 MV x-ray beams, and comparison to 60Co therapy beams shows that this unit may be more like 60Co units in penumbra and absence of off-axis peaking than other low-energy accelerators

The procedure verifies a prescribed intensity modulated x-ray beam pattern in the beam eye's view (BEV) before the treatment procedure is applied to a patient. It verifies that (a) the leaf sequencing computer files were transferred correctly to the linac control computer; (b) the treatment can be correctly executed without machine faults. A fast beam imaging system (BIS) consisting of a Gd2O2S scintillation screen, a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and a portable personal computer (Wellhofer Dosimetrie, Schwarzenbruck, Germany) was commissioned for this purpose. Measurements for the BIS performance are presented in this work. Reference images were derived from MLC leaf sequencing files that were used to drive a dynamic MLC system (Varian Oncology Systems, Palo Alto, CA). A correlation method was developed to compare the BIS measurements with the calculated reference images. A correlation coefficient calculated using 26 correct intensity modulated fields was shown to be a reliable threshold to identify inaccurate treatment delivery files. The study has demonstrated the feasibility of using the BIS and the correlation method to carry out on-line quality assurance tasks for IMCRT treatment fields in the BEV

The first group consisting of 19 patients was submitted to a combined percutaneous and interstitial treatment, the other six patients were initially treated only by interstitial therapy because of severe complications observed in the meantime. After bilateral pelvic staging lymphadenectomy, permanent iodine-125 seeds were implanted into the patients of stage T1, T2, early T3, and pN0-1, in case of microscopic lymph node manifestation without capsular perforation also into patients of stage pN2 and pN4. Eight weeks later the patients received a moving beam irradiation with 10 MV photons at the linear accelerator. The centre of the prostate was faded out by a specially constructed H absorber in such a way that the prescribed target dose of 36 Gy in four weeks to the 90%-isodose was only applied to a spherical surface around the implant. One patient died perioperatively from an embolism due to phlebothrombosis of the thigh. 22 out of the other 24 patients are in complete remission, one patient had a local recurrence in the right seminal vesicle which appeared 28 months after primary therapy, and one patient developed skeletal metastases. The objective side effects and late complications of our combined treatment are considerable with respect to their incidence as well as their severity: a slight or medium radioproctitis was found after a latent period of one to two years in 28% (5/18) of cases, after a latent time of about 1 1/2 to two years another 28% (5/18) developed subsequently to a proctitis an urethral stricture and an ulcer situated on the anterior rectum wall facing the prostate, and four patients presented finally a prostato-rectal fistula

PATIENTS AND METHOD: 126 eyes of 118 patients (age 55-89 years; mean 74 ys.) were treated. Best distal and near visual acuity was assessed prior to (= initial visual acuity [IVA]) and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after teletherapy. Fluorescein angiography was performed prior to and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after radiation therapy. For analysis patients were divided into different groups by IVA and membrane size. Maximal duration of observation was 36 months. Teletherapy was done by a 9-MeV photon linear accelerator through a lateral port in half-beam technique with a single dose of 2 Gy up to a total dose of 20 Gy within 12 days. RESULTS: No severe negative side effects have been observed. Eight patients reported of epiphora and four patients complained of transient sicca syndrome. Visual acuity decreased more than one line in the group IVA 0.05-0.2. The group IVA 0.3-0.5 remained unchanged for 1 year. We found a tendency for increased visual acuity in group IVA > or = 0.6 for 18 months. After that time both groups showed decreased visual acuity, but all these patients reported of reduced metamorphopsia and increased color and contrast perception. CONCLUSIONS: There is an influence of low dose fractionated percutaneous teletherapy on visual acuity, subfoveal neovascular membranes and metamorphopsia. IVA and duration of anamnesis play an important role. There seems to be no persistent effect; possibly increased dosage will bring a benefit

Such data, in turn, would facilitate the optimization of the temporal sequence of boronated drug infusion and neutron irradiation. Current approaches to obtaining such pharmacokinetic data include: positron emission tomography employing F-18 labeled boronated delivery agents (e.g., p-boronophenylalanine), ex vivo neutron activation analysis of blood (and very occasionally tissue) samples, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. In general, NMR approaches have been hindered by very poor signal to noise achieved due to the large quadrupole moments of B-10 and B-11 and (in the case of B-10) very low gyromagnetic ratio, combined with low physiological concentrations of these isotopes under clinical conditions. This preliminary study examines the feasibility of proton NMR spectroscopy for such applications. We have utilized proton NMR spectroscopy to investigate the detectability of p-boronophenylalanine fructose (BPA-f) at typical physiological concentrations encountered in BNCT. BPA-f is one of the two boron delivery agents currently undergoing clinical phase-I/II trials in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. This study includes high-resolution 1H spectroscopic characterization of BPA-f to identify useful spectral features for purposes of detection and quantification. The study examines potential interferences, demonstrates a linear NMR signal response with concentration, and presents BPA NMR spectra in ex vivo blood samples and in vivo brain tissues

A Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic apparatus and a 6-MeV linear accelerator equipped with a special collimator (12.5 to 30 mm in diameter) have been adapted. The 20-mm collimator allows treatment of a nearly spherical volume of 2.1 ml. Outside the treatment field, the dosage declines to 80% of the dose prescribed for the periphery of the lesion over a distance of 1.8 mm and to 50% over the next 3.4 mm. Localization can be accomplished via computed tomography or cerebral angiography. Treatment is accomplished with an arcing beam of photon radiation with the turntable (couch) in each of four positions. The entire system has been extensively tested for accuracy in alignment and distribution of radiation. Errors have been measured for the alignment of the apparatus and for the process of localization. Safety of operation was emphasized throughout the design and testing phase

We have developed a dynamic intravenous coronary angiography (IVCAG) system using synchrotron radiation (SR) and have used it clinically. Four patients suspected of having angina pectoris underwent IVCAG. An SR beam was reflected asymmetrically with a silicon crystal to produce a wide (150 mm x 80 mm) and monochromatic (37 keV) X-ray beam, with an energy level to achieve high sensitivity to the contrast agent. Following an intravenous injection of contrast agent, irradiation was applied for 4 ms periods at 33 ms intervals for dynamic IVCAG at 30 images s-1. Images were acquired with an image intensifier and recorded with a digital fluorography system. The dynamic images permitted clear visualization of the coronary arteries and permitted evaluation of coronary anatomy. Two patients exhibited no stenotic lesions, one patient had a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and the remaining patient had a 25% stenosis at the site of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The total irradiation doses used for IVCAG were less than those for conventional angiography. Dynamic IVCAG can be readily used for the evaluation of coronary arteries

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma

Protons were accelerated by the Peking University 4.5 MV electrostatic accelerator. Two disk-shaped 9Be targets with thickness 1.5 and 3 mm were used in the measurements. The time-of-flight spectra were observed at zero degrees with respect to the incident proton beam. The analysis to these time-of-flight spectra is given. The time-of-flight spectra were converted to the energy spectra and compared to a neutron spectrum of 7Li(p, n)7 Be reaction with incident energy 2.5 MeV, which was also measured in this work. Restricted by the spectrometer itself, the threshold of the measurements is 400 keV. The results show that by using several MeV protons bombarding a thick beryllium target, reactions other than 9Be(p, n)9B produce significant contributions to the neutron yield with energy less than 1 MeV	
446	Integrating a MRI scanner with a 6 MV radiotherapy accelerator: impact of the surface orientation on the entrance and exit dose due to the transverse magnetic field	Air, Anatomy, Computer Simulation, Electromagnetic Fields, Electrons, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/is [Instrumentation], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research	At the UMC Utrecht, in collaboration with Elekta and Philips Research Hamburg, we are developing a radiotherapy accelerator with integrated MRI functionality. The radiation dose will be delivered in the presence of a lateral 1.5 T field. Although the photon beam is not affected by the magnetic field, the actual dose deposition is done by a cascade of secondary electrons and these electrons are affected by the Lorentz force. The magnetic field causes a reduced build-up distance: because the trajectory of the electrons between collisions is curved, the entrance depth in tissue decreases. Also, at tissue-air interfaces an increased dose occurs due to the so-called electron return effect (ERE): electrons leaving tissue will describe a circular path in air and re-enter the tissue yielding a local dose increase. In this paper the impact of a 1.5 T magnetic field on both the build-up distance and the dose increase due to the ERE will be investigated as a function of the angle between the surface and the incident beam. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that in the presence of a 1.5 T magnetic field, the surface dose, the build-up distance and the exit dose depend more heavily on the surface orientation than in the case without magnetic field. This is caused by the asymmetrical pointspread kernel in the presence of 1.5 T and the directional behaviour of the re-entering electrons. Simulations on geometrical phantoms show that ERE dose increase at air cavities can be avoided using opposing beams, also when the air-tissue boundary is not perpendicular to the beam. For the more general case in patient anatomies, more problems may arise. Future work will address the possibilities and limitations of opposing beams in combination with IMRT in a magnetic field

Test subjects may be irradiated from any angle with respect to the vertical because the beamline is contained within a rotating gantry used for human patients. Converting from the treatment to experimental arrangement is quick and straightforward as is the reverse. Using a series of collimators, the final beam diameter at the surface of the subject is 1 mm. The depth from the surface to the Bragg peak in water is 15 mm. Fluence distributions perpendicular to the beam axis were determined by scanning radiographic film exposed at various depths with a scanner having a pixel size of 84.7 microm. The depth dose integrated over the beam area was measured using a parallel plate ionization chamber. Central axis depth doses were calculated by multiplying the ionization chamber signal by the ratio of film doses for the central axis pixels to the integrated beam doses at each depth. A Faraday cup was used to confirm the dose at the surface while TLDs, diodes, and film were used to verify the dose at depth. The usefulness of this beamline for experimental situations has been demonstrated in a feline neurological study. The dosimetry techniques are useful for narrow beams such as used for functional radiosurgery treatments of humans

[Russian]	Adolescent, Adult, Arteriovenous Fistula/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Cerebral Arteries, Cerebral Veins, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Protons, Retrospective Studies, Stereotaxic Techniques	The paper is concerned with analysis of angiographic findings on 62 patients with arteriovenous aneurysms (AVA) of the cerebral vessels who received proton beam stereotactic therapy in the period of 1978-1986 depending on an absorbed dose value of an irradiated volume. Proton stereotactic therapy (PST) of brain AVA located deep in the functionally important regions, can be used as an independent radical therapeutic method in such cases including inoperable ones. Complete AVA elimination from the blood flow or considerable reduction of the AVA volume was achieved in 68% of the patients after delivering a dose of approximately 40 Gy, the AVA volume being approximately 30%. Significant (p less than 0.05) correlation of PST results, a dose of irradiation and a value of the AVA irradiated volume was established in the groups with positive results and in the nonresponding groups

Although this tumor is radio-resistant and located in a very radiosensitive organ, a conservative approach using radiotherapy is feasible for small or medium size melanomas. The physical and radiobiological basis of the techniques presently used, brachytherapy and protontherapy, are presented together with the complications inherent to each treatment. Future prospects discussed concern the association of hyperthermia with conventional irradiation and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The relevance of each technique with reference to the size and location of the tumor is discussed. [References: 196]

The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

The structures of these compounds were characterized with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, infrared spectra and mass spectra. The UV-visible absorption spectra, singlet oxygen-generating quantum yield and amphiphilicities of hypocrellin derivatives were measured and compared with HB, the parent compound. These derivatives showed strong absorption in the domain of the phototherapeutic window (600-900 nm) and improved amphiphilicity. HB and the derivatives were preliminarily tested for their photodynamic effects on human oral cavity epithelial carcinoma KB cell line in vitro. Two amino acid-substituted hypocrellins showed phototoxicity to the KB cell line. At an inhibitory dosage of 50% killing only 0.51 mumol L-1 compound 3 (or 0.88 mumol L-1 compound 2) and 0.5 J cm-2 irradiation were required. The hypocrellins exhibited some dark toxicity to the KB cell line. HB and amino acid-substituted hypocrellins showed lower dark toxicity to the KB cell line than amino-substituted hypocrellins in the assessment of cell survival

Using a 1 cGy alpha-particle to irradiate 50% of the area of a rectangular mylar dish, time-dependent DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were induced shortly after irradiation in AG1522 cells, located either in the irradiated area or in the non-irradiated bystander area, reaching a maximum 30 min post irradiation. Medium transfer experiments showed that the conditioned medium harvested from the irradiated culture induced excessive DNA DSBs in the medium recipient cells, and the DSB-inducing ability of the medium showed was time-dependent. The medium transfer results indicated that the soluble bystander signalling molecule(s) had been generated very soon (probably less than 2.5 min) after irradiation and exist continuously to 30 min although the production of signalling molecule(s) decreased after 10 min post irradiation. Pre-treatment with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) eliminated the DNA DSB-inducing ability of the conditioned medium, as well as the formation of excessive DNA DSBs in both irradiated and non-irradiated bystander areas, indicating that reactive oxygen/nitrogen species etc. might be involved in these processes

DESIGN: Systematic literature study. METHOD: Systematic electronic searches were carried out in 12 databases according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, without restriction as to year of publication or study design. Manual searches of bibliographies and journals were also performed. The inclusion criteria were: at least 20 patients and a follow-up of at least 2 years. In addition, experts on the subject were consulted by correspondence for their opinion. RESULTS: The search identified 36 relevant articles on proton therapy and 15 on ion therapy. Based on prospective and retrospective studies, proton irradiation emerged as the treatment of choice for ocular tumours, chordomas and skull-base tumours. For prostate cancer, the results were comparable with the best results of photon therapy. Ion therapy was still in an experimental phase. CONCLUSION: According to the current literature, proton therapy is looked upon as the preferred treatment modality for certain rare tumours, such as ocular tumours, chordoma, and skull-base tumours. However, charged particle therapy as a whole, and especially ion therapy, is not supported as the treatment of choice for cancer by published evidence. Nevertheless, the potential theoretical benefit of this treatment is great. [References: 68]	
697	Initial patient imaging with an optimised radiotherapy beam for portal imaging	Electrons, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Mammography, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and the advantages of a portal-imaging mode on a medical accelerator, consisting of a thin low-Z bremsstrahlung target and a thin Gd2O2S/film detector, for patient imaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The international code of practice for high-energy photon dosimetry was used to calibrate dosimetry instruments for the imaging beam produced by 4.75 MeV electrons hitting a 6mm thick aluminium target. Images of the head and neck of a humanoid phantom were taken with a mammography film system and the dose in the phantom was measured with TLDs calibrated for this beam. The first head and neck patient images are compared with conventional images (taken with the treatment beam on a film radiotherapy verification detector). Visibility of structures for six patients was evaluated. RESULTS: Images of the head and neck of a humanoid phantom, taken with both imaging systems showed that the contrast increased dramatically for the new system while the dose required to form an image was less than 10(-2)Gy. The patient images taken with the new and the conventional systems showed that air-tissue interfaces were better defined in the new system image. Anatomical structures, visible on both films, are clearer with the new system. Additionally, bony structures, such as vertebrae, were clearly visible only with the new system. The system under evaluation was significantly better for all features in lateral images and most features in anterior images. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study of the new portal imaging system showed the image quality is significantly improved

This study was to analyze long-term treatment efficacy, and relevant factors influencing prognosis of NPC in children. METHODS: From Jan. 1975 to Dec. 1995, 47 children,7-14 years old, with NPC diagnosed by pathology received radiotherapy in our hospital. Radiation doses were 52-74 Gy/6-13 weeks [(64.68+/-5.68) Gy] in nasopharynx, and 46-73 Gy/5-13 weeks [(57.77+/-5.86) Gy] in neck; 21 received 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluoroucil, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) before radiotherapy. Survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and analyzed by log-rank test with SPSS 10.0 software. RESULTS: The 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 47 patients were 72.3%, 53.2%, and 40.4%, respectively. Clinical stage (P=0.046), mode of biopsy (P=0.024), radiation dose in nasopharynx (P=0.049), and short-term efficacy (P=0.005) correlated with prognosis of these patients. The average height of 15 male children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years was (161.5+/-1.23) cm. Among 3 female children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years, 2 had menstruation disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage, mode of biopsy, radiation dose in nasopharynx, short-term efficacy may influence prognosis of NPC in children. Radiation-induced long-term sequelae of NPC in children should not be overlooked

Choroidal biopsy confirmed that the clinical diagnosis and conventional radiotherapy to one eye resulted in rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, cataract, and vitreous hemorrhage. We were able to destroy the tumors in the other eye by photocoagulation and proton beam irradiation without any adverse effects.

1646	Isotropic beam bouquets for shaped beam linear accelerator radiosurgery	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	In stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy treatment planning, the steepest dose gradient is obtained by using beam arrangements with maximal beam separation. We propose a treatment plan optimization method that optimizes beam directions from the starting point of a set of isotropically convergent beams, as suggested by Webb. The optimization process then individually steers each beam to the best position, based on beam's-eye-view (BEV) critical structure overlaps with the target projection and the target's projected cross sectional area at each beam position. This final optimized beam arrangement maintains a large angular separation between adjacent beams while conformally avoiding critical structures. As shown by a radiosurgery plan, this optimization method improves the critical structure sparing properties of an unoptimized isotropic beam bouquet, while maintaining the same degree of dose conformity and dose gradient. This method provides a simple means of designing static beam radiosurgery plans with conformality indices that are within established guidelines for radiosurgery planning, and with dose gradients that approach those achieved in conventional radiosurgery planning

Most of the tumours grew superficially and half deeply. Results were analysed with regard to tumour regression, local recurrence and frequency of metastases after treatment. Surprisingly good tumour regression, a low local recurrence rate (11%) and no enhancement of distant metastases were found. Treatment rhythms hat not to be altered. Tissue reactions were extremely low. The combined hyperthermia-radiation treatment has its advantages especially, when ionising radiation of low LET is used	
263	Dynamic-MLC leaf control utilizing on-flight intensity calculations: a robust method for real-time IMRT delivery over moving rigid targets	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Gold, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Models,Statistical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Software, Time Factors	An algorithm is presented that allows for the control of multileaf collimation (MLC) leaves based entirely on real-time calculations of the intensity delivered over the target. The algorithm is capable of efficiently correcting generalized delivery errors without requiring the interruption of delivery (self-correcting trajectories), where a generalized delivery error represents anything that causes a discrepancy between the delivered and intended intensity profiles. The intensity actually delivered over the target is continually compared to its intended value. For each pair of leaves, these comparisons are used to guide the control of the following leaf and keep this discrepancy below a user-specified value. To demonstrate the basic principles of the algorithm, results of corrected delivery are shown for a leading leaf positional error during dynamic-MLC (DMLC) IMRT delivery over a rigid moving target. It is then shown that, with slight modifications, the algorithm can be used to track moving targets in real time. The primary results of this article indicate that the algorithm is capable of accurately delivering DMLC IMRT over a rigid moving target whose motion is (1) completely unknown prior to delivery and (2) not faster than the maximum MLC leaf velocity over extended periods of time. These capabilities are demonstrated for clinically derived intensity profiles and actual tumor motion data, including situations when the target moves in some instances faster than the maximum admissible MLC leaf velocity. The results show that using the algorithm while calculating the delivered intensity every 50 ms will provide a good level of accuracy when delivering IMRT over a rigid moving target translating along the direction of MLC leaf travel. When the maximum velocities of the MLC leaves and target were 4 and 4.2 cm/s, respectively, the resulting error in the two intensity profiles used was 0.1 +/- 3.1% and -0.5 +/- 2.8% relative to the maximum of the intensity profiles. For the same target motion, the error was shown to increase rapidly as (1) the maximum MLC leaf velocity was reduced below 75% of the maximum target velocity and (2) the system response time was increased	
2974	Neurovisual outcome following proton radiation therapy	Adult, Boston, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Color, Eye, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Optic Chiasm, Optic Chiasm/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	From February 1981 to January 1984, 20 patients with a tumor of the upper clivus received proton irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended	
2129	Methods for the determination of effective monitor chamber thickness	Biophysics, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Sweden, Universities	There are a number of models, both analytical and Monte Carlo, which are used to describe the fluence from the treatment head of accelerators. One common problem in these simulations is to find relevant information about details in the treatment head. A complex unit in the treatment head for which reliable data is seldom given is the monitor chamber. In this work two methods are described for obtaining this information by analyzing the increased scattering of an electron beam when the monitor chamber is introduced in the beam. It was found that the effective thickness of the electrodes in a monitor chamber can be determined with sufficient accuracy by using experimental results combined with Fermi-Eyges theory or Monte Carlo simulations	
1362	Proton radiotherapy for paediatric tumours: potential areas for clinical research	Biomedical Research, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Central Nervous System Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Radiotherapy plays an important role in the management of children with cancer. The aim is to achieve local tumour control while minimizing long-term effects. In the treatment of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) the most important long-term effects are neuropsychological. Elsewhere orthopaedic long-term effects may compromise function or be cosmetically harmful. Proton therapy has the potential for homogeneous irradiation of the target volume while reducing the magnitude and/or extent of the low dose area outside the target volume. This may be clinically relevant for long-term effects in children. Proton radiotherapy has an established role in the treatment of children with chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. Planning studies have demonstrated the potential for improving the therapeutic ratio for radiotherapy for tumours of the central nervous system by achieving a uniform dose within the target volume while minimizing the severity of neuropsychological sequelae. Clinical experience of proton radiotherapy for children remains limited with potential areas for clinical research

METHODS: The authors review the current status of advanced technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. RESULTS: Advances in radiotherapy have resulted in improved treatment for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses modifications in the intensity of the photon-beam from a linear accelerator across the irradiated fields to enhance dose conformation in three dimensions. For proton-beam radiation therapy, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are accelerated in cyclotrons or synchrotrons, extracted, and transported to treatment rooms where the proton beam undergoes a series of modifications that conform the dose in a particular patient to the tumor target. Brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy have generally been used to treat microscopic residual disease in patients with sarcomas. These technologies deliver dose to tumor cells with irradiation of limited volumes of normal tissue. Patients who may benefit from technically advanced radiotherapy include those with skull base and spine/paraspinal sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and retroperitoneal/extremity sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in radiation therapy technology, particularly IMRT, proton-beam or other charged-particle radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and intraoperative radiation therapy, have led to improved treatment for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

Phosphorus spectroscopy data at 1.5 T seems to suggest that any radiation induced damage that may occur as a result of therapeutic brain irradiation, does not alter the relative concentrations of phosphorus metabolites or the intracellular pH beyond the limits of normal variation (approximately +/- 20%). Proton spectroscopy, on the other hand, detects post radiation changes in the ratios of certain nuclear magnetic resonance visible metabolites following radiotherapy, particularly choline/N-acetylaspartate, and especially in regions of brain receiving high doses of radiation. Such changes may be indicative of the release of membrane bound choline during radiation induced demyelination of brain. Of interest, we have found elevated metabolite ratios of 31P in normal central nervous system prior to radiotherapy, which persisted throughout the time span of the study in both the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres

Consequently, we might observe liberation of metallic debris and wear. Our purpose is to measure the contamination and the migration of these metallic elements in the surrounding tissues of the implant. Two types of samples have been studied. First type is sample taken on post-mortem tissues around prostheses to study contamination gradients. Second type is sample taken on pathologic joints on periprosthetic capsular tissues in surgical conditions. These allow estimating contamination degree. The experiments were made on a Van de Graaff accelerator located at CERI (Centre d'Etude et de Recherche par Irradiation, Orleans, France). We measure elemental concentrations resulting from the contamination of the surface of each sample. Results are analysed in function of the pathology and the type of implants. According to the pathology and the location of the sampling, these measurements show a very heterogeneous contamination by metallic elements under particles and/or ionic species which can migrate through soft tissues by various mechanisms

First, we determined steady-state activity ratios of 232Th progeny from 13 autopsy cases and found them to be identical to those reported in German subjects. Second, we estimated the alpha dose rates in 206 subjects at autopsy from radioactivity measurements and terminal weights of the organs. Combining these results with measurements of exhaled 220Rn in survivors, we considered the representative dose rates at injection to be 0.22 Gy y-1. Additionally, our data suggest that deposition in the spleen has previously been overestimated. This is an error with some bearing on the evaluation of leukemia risks from alpha-particle irradiation	
924	Influence of patient age on biochemical freedom from disease in patients undergoing conformal proton radiotherapy of organ-confined prostate cancer	Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Life Tables, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Survival, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVES: To examine a large, single-institution series of patients to test the perception among clinicians that radiotherapy is preferred for "older" patients and surgery should be indicated for "younger" men. Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another	
3434	Stereotactic radiosurgery of the brain using a standard linear accelerator: a study of early and late effects	Acute Disease, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Alopecia/et [Etiology], Aphasia/et [Etiology], Arm, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/ra [Radiography], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Hemiplegia/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Leg, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Pons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Scalp, Temporal Lobe, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Vomiting/et [Etiology], Women	Between February 1986 and December 1988, 44 patients were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery using a standard linear accelerator. Twenty one patients were treated for cerebrovascular abnormalities and 23 patients were treated for intracranial tumors. Fifteen of the 23 patients treated for intracranial tumors had received previous radiotherapy. The range of doses given by radiosurgery was 1000-2500 cGy. Nausea and vomiting occurred in seven patients within six hours of treatment. The incidence and symptoms were correlated with the dose of radiation to the vomiting center (area postrema) with the median dose to the postrema in symptomatic patients being 618 cGy compared to a range of less than 5 to 184 cGy in the remaining 36 asymptomatic patients. Temporary alopecia occurred in a single patient who received 400 cGy to the scalp. Alopecia did not occur in the remaining 43 patients who received from less than 5 to 175 cGy. Two patients treated for arteriovenous malformations developed an enhancing lesion on CT scanning (one with cerebral edema) on follow-up CT scanning six and twenty-eight months following radiosurgery. The location of these enhancing lesions corresponded to the volumes treated. In one patient, the enhancing pattern and edema disappeared within 18 months of treatment and no neurological deficits developed. Aphasia occurred in one patient treated for a recurrent glioma two hours following treatment to the left temporal lobe and cleared within 12 h of radiosurgery. One patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the pons developed weakness of the contralateral arm and leg six weeks following treatment and this has slowly resolved over the last 12 months. In conclusion, the complications to date have been self-limited and appear to be directly related to the dose and area of brain treated. Prior radiation therapy has not been associated with increased risk of complication in patients treated with radiosurgery for recurrent tumors to date	
3739	The role of MR and CT in evaluating clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anatomy, Boston, Carotid Arteries, Cavernous Sinus, Child, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Chordoma, Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/ra [Radiography], Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Occipital Bone, Optic Chiasm, Skull Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Sphenoid Bone, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Sixteen chordomas and nine chondrosarcomas of the clivus were evaluated with CT and MR either before (22 cases) or after (three cases) treatment with proton beam irradiation. The ability of these imaging techniques to provide information necessary to direct patient treatment was studied. The tumor was detected and its gross margins were identified by both techniques in all instances. No reliable diagnostic features allowing differentiation between these two tumors were encountered. MR generally was superior in defining the exact position of the brainstem and optic chiasm relative to the tumor, and it frequently provided superior information about tumor extension into the nasopharynx and cavernous sinus. CT was always better than MR in demonstrating tumoral calcification and in defining the exact anatomy of bone destruction. MR was generally superior to CT in demonstrating the position of the cavernous internal carotid artery relative to the tumor and often provided superior visualization of the vertebral and basilar arteries. In cases in which bone-induced artifact obscured the interface between the neural axis and tumor in the CT image, or in which the tumor had suprasellar extension and was likely to compress the optic chiasm and tracts, MR was of great value in planning irradiation therapy. The high occurrence of clinically asymptomatic signal intensity alterations in the MR studies of previously treated patients appears to limit the differential diagnostic value of this information. Given its greater availability and lower cost, CT appears to be the technique of choice for routine follow-up of previously treated patients	
1037	New equations for matching a low neck field to oblique upper neck fields with collimator rotation in a 3-field monoisocentric setup for head-and-neck cancers	Algorithms, Film Dosimetry, Forecasting, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Neck/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation, Software, Texas, Water	With a monoisocentric 3-field technique for treating head-and-neck cancer, collimator rotation may be needed for the upper lateral fields to avoid cephalad-positioned shoulders or to avoid unnecessary arytenoid irradiation while maintaining more anterior coverage. For patients with unilateral lymphadenopathy, lateral oblique-opposed boost fields can be used to encompass the primary tumor and ipsilateral lymph nodes without junctioning through gross disease. When initial collimated lateral fields are also rotated with a gantry angle to produce oblique boost fields, however, the resulting matchline with a low anterior neck (LAN) boost field is no longer nondivergent. This can be corrected by manual adjustment of collimator and gantry angles for the LAN field using 3D treatment planning software. The goal of this study was to derive mathematical formulas to simplify this process. We used a transformation matrix to define formulas that could predict the appropriate modifications to the LAN boost field. Output from the formulas was (1) visually tested within 3D treatment planning software and (2) verified using a solid water head-and-neck phantom and radiographic film dosimetry to confirm that a nondivergent matchline was obtained in several clinical scenarios. When evaluated with 3D treatment planning software, the formulas accurately predicted the appropriate gantry and collimator angles of the LAN boost field for a variety of possible beam combinations. When evaluated with film dosimetry, the formulas were shown to accurately predict the appropriate gantry and collimator angles of the LAN boost field to within the +/- 2 mm/1 degrees tolerance specifications of the linear accelerator and acceptable for routine clinical use. The presented formulas are simple and geometrically precise. They predict the necessary manipulations of the LAN boost field to maintain a geometrically precise matchline, as verified by 3D treatment planning software, phantom dosimetry, and actual patient setups	
4430	Verification of electron beam therapy with storage phosphor images: precision of field placement	Electrons, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards], Research, Universities	Portal verification images were generated from the photon contamination in electron beams produced by a linear accelerator during treatment of patients receiving high-energy electron radiation therapy (8-14 MeV). An experimental storage phosphor system was used to record the images and display them on laser-printed film. Images were obtained from four or more treatment fractions from 21 cases of head and neck cancer. Precision in field placement was estimated by determining the position of a selected anatomic landmark relative to the center of the field for each series of images. The average standard deviation in the field-position measurements was 3.8 mm. Several procedural problems were also detected and corrected after review of the verification images. The results indicate that the emphasis placed on monitoring and control of field-positioning error in high-energy electron treatments should be similar to the emphasis placed on this aspect of error in photon treatment	
580	Intraoperative radiation therapy using a mobile electron linear accelerator: field matching for large-field electron irradiation	Electrons, Film Dosimetry, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Mobile Health Units, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Time	Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) consists of delivering a large, single-fraction dose of radiation to a surgically exposed tumour or tumour bed at the time of surgery. With the availability of a mobile linear accelerator in the OR, IORT procedures have become more feasible for medical centres and more accessible to cancer patients. Often the area requiring irradiation is larger than what the treatment applicators will allow, and therefore, two or more adjoining fields are used. Unfortunately, the divergence and scattering of the electron beams may cause significant dose variations in the region of the field junction. Furthermore, because IORT treatments are delivered in a large single fraction, the effects of underdosing or overdosing could be more critical when compared to fractionated external beam therapy. Proper matching of the fields is therefore an important technical aspect of treatment delivery. We have studied the matching region using the largest flat applicator available for three different possibilities: abutting the fields, leaving a small gap or creating an overlap. Measurements were done using film dosimetry for the available energies of 4, 6, 9 and 12 MeV. Our results show the presence of clinically significant cold spots for the low-energy beams when the fields are either gapped or abutted, suggesting that the fields should be overlapped. No fields should be gapped. The results suggest that an optimal dose distribution may be obtained by overlapping the fields at 4 and 6 MeV and simply abutting the fields at 9 and 12 MeV. However, due to uncertainties in the placement of lead shields during treatment delivery, one may wish to consider overlapping the higher energy fields as well	
187	Comparison of radiosurgery treatment modalities based on complication and control probabilities	Algorithms, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Probability, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage	PURPOSE: The relative efficacy of Gamma Knife, Linac, and Proton treatment modalities for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was investigated on the basis of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and tumor control probability (TCP), calculated for representative test cases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan	
2752	An evaluation of the influence of reproductive factors on the risk of metastases from uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Contraceptives,Oral, Environment, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Middle Aged, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/mo [Mortality], Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/pa [Pathology], Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Reproductive History, Risk, Risk Factors, Sex Factors, Survival Analysis, Women	BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data concerning the possible role played by hormonal factors in the risk of metastases from intraocular melanomas. METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma	
1374	Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning for dynamic multileaf collimator delivery: influence of different parameters on dose distributions	Algorithms, Confidence Intervals, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Knowledge, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, Sweden	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This is an investigation of a dose-based conjugated gradient optimization method (implemented in the CadPlan/Helios system) applied for head and neck tumours. Optimized field fluence distributions are created and transformed into dynamic multileaf collimator (MLC) movements. The aim was to gain knowledge about the influence of different parameters on the dose distribution and how to use the optimization algorithm in an optimum way. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Parameters such as the number of beams, collimator angle and constraints and weight factors have been investigated. Dose escalation to the target volume, the target volume in the build-up region and the way of prescribing the target dose were also investigated. The dose distributions were mainly analysed with physical parameters. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The optimization algorithm is well suited to create clinical Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans for head and neck tumours even when the target volume is situated in the build-up region. The number of beams is a critical parameter and has a great influence on the dose distribution. The choice of collimator angles is not a critical parameter. The constraints and weight factors have a great influence on the dose distribution and varying these could easily control priorities regarding dose to the target volume or to the surrounding critical organs. Because of dose variations inside the target volume, prescribing to, normalizing to and reporting the mean dose in the target volume for IMRT treatment plans is preferable to the absorbed dose at a point, for example the isocentre point	
833	The promise of targeted {alpha}-particle therapy. [Review] [40 refs]	Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Delivery Systems/mt [Methods], Drug Delivery Systems/td [Trends], Humans, Isotopes, Linear Energy Transfer, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physician's Practice Patterns/td [Trends], Practice Guidelines as Topic, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/mt [Methods], Radioimmunotherapy/td [Trends], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/tu [Therapeutic Use], Safety, Treatment Outcome	The use of monoclonal antibodies to deliver radioisotopes directly to tumor cells has become a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of native antibodies. Since the alpha- and beta-particles emitted during the decay of radioisotopes differ in significant ways, proper selection of isotope and antibody combinations is crucial to making radioimmunotherapy a standard therapeutic modality. Because of the short pathlength (50-80 microm) and high linear energy transfer ( approximately 100 keV/microm) of alpha-emitting radioisotopes, targeted alpha-particle therapy offers the potential for more specific tumor cell killing with less damage to surrounding normal tissues than beta-emitters. These properties make targeted alpha-particle therapy ideal for the elimination of minimal residual or micrometastatic disease. Radioimmunotherapy using alpha-emitters such as (213)Bi, (211)At, and (225)Ac has shown activity in several in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and activity of targeted alpha-particle therapy in the treatment of small-volume and cytoreduced disease. Further advances will require investigation of more potent isotopes, new sources and methods of isotope production, improved chelation techniques, better methods for pharmacokinetic and dosimetric modeling, and new methods of isotope delivery such as pretargeting. Treatment of patients with less-advanced disease and, ultimately, randomized trials comparing targeted alpha-particle therapy with standard approaches will be required to determine the clinical utility of this approach.

236	Examination of geometric and dosimetric accuracies of gated step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy	Algorithms, Equipment Design, Film Dosimetry/is [Instrumentation], Humans, Ions, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Software	Due to the complicated technical nature of gated radiation therapy, electronic and mechanical limitations may affect the precision of delivery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the geometric and dosimetric accuracies of gated step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation treatments (SS-IMRT). Unique segmental MLC plans are designed, which allow quantitative testing of the gating process. Both ungated and gated deliveries are investigated for different dose sizes, dose rates, and gating window times using a commercial treatment system (Varian Trilogy) together with a respiratory gating system [Varian Real-Time Position Management system]. Radiographic film measurements are used to study the geometric accuracy, where it is found that with both ungated and gated SS-IMRT deliveries the MLC leaf divergence away from planned is less than or equal to the MLC specified leaf tolerance value for all leafs (leaf tolerance being settable from 0.5-5 mm). Nevertheless, due to the MLC controller design, failure to define a specific leaf tolerance value suitable to the SS-IMRT plan can lead to undesired geometric effects, such as leaf motion of up to the maximum 5 mm leaf tolerance value occurring after the beam is turned on. In this case, gating may be advantageous over the ungated case, as it allows more time for the MLC to reach the intended leaf configuration. The dosimetric precision of gated SS-IMRT is investigated using ionization chamber methods. Compared with the ungated case, it is found that gating generally leads to increased dosimetric errors due to the interruption of the "overshoot phenomena." With gating the average timing deviation for intermediate segments is found to be 27 ms, compared to 18 ms for the ungated case. For a plan delivered at 600 MU/min this would correspond to an average segment dose error of approximately 0.27 MU and approximately 0.18 MU for gated and ungated deliveries, respectively. The maximum dosimetric errors for individual intermediate segments are found to deviate by up to approximately 0.64 MU from their planned value when delivered at 600 MU/min using gating, this compares to only approximately 0.32 MU for the ungated case	
1496	Usefulness of positron-emission tomographic images after proton therapy	Brain/pa [Pathology], Ethmoid Sinus/pa [Pathology], Humans, Informed Consent, Japan, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Tomography,Emission-Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To examine the positron emission tomography (PET) image obtained after proton irradiation and investigate the usefulness of the image for confirmation of the irradiated volume in proton radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A homogenous phantom was irradiated separately by carbon-ion and proton beams and the images obtained were compared. The PET images of cancer patients just after proton RT were then taken after informed consent. RESULTS: In the PET image produced by carbon-ion beams, the high pixel counts in the image corresponded to the Bragg peak; however, in that produced by proton beams, they were visible throughout the entire track of the proton beams and were not related to the Bragg peak. The PET image of patients treated with proton RT was similar to that of the phantom experiment. CONCLUSION: The PET image after proton RT was different from that of carbon-ion RT. It was found that the PET image was very useful in proton RT to verify treatment planning

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

The latter was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of the photon and electron transport. The dependence of the calculated absorbed dose on the sample thickness was analysed. No energy dependence of the EPR signal on the absorbed dose in enamel was verified in the range of 37 keV-1.25 MeV. At 13 and 20 keV the EPR signal dose response was reduced by 8% probably due to sample powdering. Dose-depth profiles in enamel samples irradiated by 1.25 MeV photons in polymethylmethacrylate and aluminium build-up materials were calculated. It was concluded that secondary electron equilibrium conditions are better fulfilled for irradiation in aluminium, which makes this material preferable for calibration	
1675	The response of a thermoluminescent dosimeter to low energy protons in the range 30-100 keV	Electrons, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/is [Instrumentation], Universities, Vacuum	This study demonstrates the thermoluminescence (TL) response of CaF2:Tm (commercial name TLD-300) to 30-100 keV protons which were generated by means of a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. The phenomenon in which the total thermoluminescent output from CaF2:Tm (TLD-300) decreases with proton energy from 30 to 100 keV (with increase of LET) can be interpreted by the track structure theory (TST). The analysis of the glow peaks: P2 (131 degrees C), P3 (153.5 degrees C) and P6 (259 degrees C), of TLD-300 show the oscillatory decreasing phenomenon as a function of incident proton energy, which can be interpreted with the TST and the oscillatory emission of electrons in a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) that is caused by resonant or quasi-resonant charge transfer in ion-atom interactions in this TLD-300

The central-axis percent depth-dose values are intermediate between a 4 and 6 MV X-ray beam. The build-up curves reach a depth of maximum dose at 1.2 cm and have surface dose values of approximately 30%. Teflon flattening filters are employed to flatten the beam at the depth of the 75% dose level. Two wedges are available for shaping the beam; they are made of Teflon and produce wedge angles of 31 degrees and 45 degrees as defined by the ICRU. Output factors ranged from 0.88 for a 4 x 4 cm field to 1.12 for a 20 x 20 cm field. Tungsten blocks reduced the dose received at Dmax to 25% of the unblocked value but only 52% of the unblocked value at a depth of 22.8 cm

Exponentially growing Human-hamster hybrid (AL) cells were plated on either one or both sides of double-mylar dishes 2-4 days before irradiation. One side (with or without cells) was irradiated with alpha particles using the track segment mode of a 4 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facilities of Columbia University. Since alpha particles can only traverse a very limited distance, cells plated on the other side of a medium-filled mylar dish will not be irradiated by the alpha particles. The results of chromosomal aberrations on un-irradiated target cells that were attached to the top mylar layer indicate that the number of chromatid-type aberrations was higher when there was a bottom layer of cells in the medium filled chambers than just medium alone. Furthermore, when transferring the medium from these cell-irradiated dishes to fresh AL cultures, chromatid-type aberrations were produced in the un-irradiated fresh cells. In contrast, medium irradiated in the absence of cells had no effect on chromatid aberrations. These results suggest that certain modulating factors secreted from the irradiated cells on the bottom mylar layer into the medium, induce chromatin damage in the un-irradiated, bystander cells	
1402	Estimation of a cosmonaut's radiation hazard during long-term space missions on the basis of a generalized dosimetric function	Aerospace Medicine, Algorithms, Astronauts, Cosmic Radiation, Extraterrestrial Environment, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Theoretical, Occupational Exposure, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring, Radiobiology/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Russia, Space Flight, Spacecraft	This paper presents a new concept of radiation hazard assessment for spacecraft crew members during long term space missions on the basis of a generalized dosimetric function. This new dosimetric function enables a complicated nature of space radiation exposure to be reduced to the conditions of a standard irradiation. It can be obtained on the basis of mean-tissue equivalent dose values calculated for each space radiation source and transmission coefficients describing the influence of the complex spatial and temporal distribution of the absorbed dose in the cosmonaut's body on the radiobiological effects. The combination of cosmic ionizing radiation with other non-radiation nature factors in flight can also be accounted for. In terms of the generalized dose, it is possible to assess the nature and extent of lowering a crew working capacity, as well as radiation risk, both during a flight and post flight period. c2002 COSPAR.

1606	An overview of recent charged-particle radiation biology in Italy	Animals, Cell Physiology/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosome Aberrations, DNA Damage, Elementary Particles, Humans, Ions, Italy, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiobiology, Radiobiology/td [Trends], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Research/td [Trends], Space Flight/td [Trends], Time	Radiobiology with charged particles is being carried out in Italy since several decades, starting with the experiments with protons in Milan. Later, also other groups entered the field, such as those in Naples, in Legnaro (LNL) and in Rome. In the last 10-15 years the activities in the field began to grow in a significant way. This happened in concomitance with the involvement of various researchers and Institutions in European and international projects devoted to radiation protection aspects, such as those aimed at elucidating and modelling radiation action mechanisms (EC/EU) and those aimed at radiation protection in space (NASA). A special role has been played since then by the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro of the INFN, where a radiobiology facility for low energy light ions was set up and operated in 1985. A formidable stimulus for charged-particle radiobiology was more recently given by the onset of plans for developing hadrontherapy Centres in Italy. The TERA Foundation first, and than the TOP Project at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, at the same time favoured the spreading in Italy of radiobiology research with charged particles and encouraged co-operation among various groups. The Italian radiobiology community, though relatively small, developed a number of valuable activities with charged particles, mostly at the cellular and molecular levels, that span from mechanisms of radiation action to radiation protection in space and to therapy with charged hadrons. In this article, due to space limitations, we have just been able to list the present activities and to briefly review some research that forms a common background for the various areas. This includes the work on Chinese hamster V79 cells irradiated with light ions at LNL, that provided extensive data on the relationships between radiation quality, molecular damage and cellular effects, and the related work aimed at possible interpretation by mechanistic models. It appears that the multiplicity of objectives does not represent a factor of weakness for the relatively small Italian radiobiology community. Synergistic effects have been found because the basic radiobiology is the same for different areas such as radiation protection and hadrontherapy, and because the expertise and the methods developed for a given purpose may find useful applications in others. Though it is difficult to forecast the future development in Italy of the various areas that will take advantage of charged-particle radiobiology, it is expected that hadrontherapy and space radiation protection together, independently of their relative weight, will be important driving forces for the future development of the field in our Country

[French]	Algorithms, Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Posture, Radiometry, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/td [Trends], Radiotherapy Dosage, Restraint,Physical/mt [Methods]	Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps--from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: "What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?". The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator	
3717	Characteristics of electron beams from a new 25-MeV linear accelerator	Calibration, Canada, Electrons, Humans, Lead, Mathematics, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Water	Clinically useful electron fields are produced on the Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Therac 25 linear accelerator by computer-controlled scanning of the electron beam. Measurements were made to determine the properties of these electron fields. Central axis percentage depth dose and bremsstrahlung background were compared for these fields and for the fields from selected machines that use scattering foils. Dose calibrations were made in both water and polystyrene using the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 21 protocol. Measurements were made to determine the relative output factors, virtual source position, and the attenuation of the electron fields by lead

[Review] [24 refs] [Japanese]	Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/dt [Drug Therapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Quality of Life, Radiotherapy, Rectal Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate	Chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of primary rectal cancers has been regarded as an effective adjuvant for surgical procedures. It has been expected to reduce local recurrence, increase the chance of sphincter-preserving operation and improve survival. However, recent advances in surgical technique for rectal cancers have reduced the local recurrence rate to no more than 10%, where the question may arise of whether adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is indeed necessary. Another matter to be elucidated is why adjuvant chemoradiotherapy does not necessarily improve overall survival for rectal cancers even when the local recurrence rate is reduced. In the treatment of locally recurrent lesions, either heavy ion radiotherapy or proton beam therapy is expected to be an effective alternative to the surgical procedure. [References: 24]

For over 35 years, radiation therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for this disease. With improvements in technology and better use of pretreatment prognostic factors, such as prostate specific antigen level and Gleason score, biochemical and clinical results have steadily improved. This article reviews the current status of radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. Results of treatment utilizing three-dimensional conformal and conventional techniques are compared and contrasted. The appropriate use of adjuvant hormones and particle beam therapy in the management of this disease is also discussed. Finally, the toxicity and future directions of radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer are addressed. [References: 97]

This technique allows treatment of small (less than 40 mm diameter) intracranial lesions, including vascular malformations, and primary and metastatic tumors that are deep within the brain or in areas not amenable to open surgery. A beam of ionizing radiation (1800 to 2500 cGy) is focused on the center of the lesion, which is determined by stereotactic localization. "Dynamic rotation" of the linac gantry and table continuously about this predetermined point ensures that only the lesion receives the full radiation dose, while the normal structures in the head receive minimal amounts of radiation. The system combines, for the first time in one place, elements of radiosurgical technique developed at various centers. Testing for accuracy compares favorably with results at other centers using linac-based systems as well as comparing favorably with the gamma knife	
3697	Wedge factor dependence on depth and field size for various beam energies using symmetric and half-collimated asymmetric jaw settings	Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Head, Humans, Jaw, Lead, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radioisotopes, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Steel, Universities, Washington, Water	The depth- and field-size dependence of the in-phantom wedge factor have been determined for a Cobalt-60 (Co-60) teletherapy unit and four medical linear accelerators with 4-, 6-, 10-, and 18-MV x-ray beams containing 15 degrees-60 degrees (nominal) lead, brass, and steel wedge filters. Measurements were made with ionization chambers in solid water or water with a source-skin distance of 80 or 100 cm. Field sizes varied from 4 x 4 cm up to a maximum allowable size for each wedge filter. Measurements were performed for symmetric and half-collimated asymmetric fields at depth of maximum dose, 5- and 10-cm depths. For half-collimated fields, wedge factor reference points were located at a fixed off-axis distance from the collimator's rotational axis. These systematic measurements on wedges indicate that the wedge factor dependence on depth and field size is a function of beam energy as well as the design of the treatment head and wedge filters. Significance of the results reported herein are discussed for the most commonly used treatment depths and field sizes with various beam energies and wedge filters

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect	
3691	The use of variable grid spacing to accelerate dose calculations	Algorithms, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Physics, Poland, Protons, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Software, Time	Planning radiation therapy using three-dimensional patient data is a very time consuming process with current hardware and software. When calculating a three-dimensional dose distribution, the standard technique is to cover the volume of interest with a uniformly spaced matrix of points at which the dose is calculated. It is obvious that the dose is usually quite slowly varying in a large proportion of the region of interest; namely, in those regions which are either well inside or well outside the geometrical boundaries of the field. We have developed an algorithm which allows us to reduce the number of calculation points, and hence the time of calculation of the entire dose distribution, manyfold. We use a nonuniform grid of calculated points, based on the fact that the only regions which are troublesome for accurate dose interpolation are those in which large values of the second derivative of the dose as a function of position occur. We demonstrate that, at most grid points, the dose can be determined without decreasing accuracy below acceptable limits by simple linear interpolation between grid points much further apart than is usual in conventional techniques. We investigated our algorithm for one-, two-, and three-dimensional examples and for Co-60, 25-MV photon, and 160-MV proton beams. In situations for which an accuracy of about 1% in dose and 1.6 mm in position was desired, we found gain factors for the number of points needing direct calculation of approximately 3 (one-dimension), 6 to 10 (two-dimensions) and 16 (three-dimensions)

3763	The calculation of transmission through a photon beam attenuator using sector integration	Air, Canada, Humans, Lead, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research	A calculational scheme is presented for the prediction of the transmitted fraction (TR) through an attenuator of known material and physical dimensions, at any point in a photon beam, for a beam of any shape or size. The method considers the total TR to be composed of scatter and primary components and computes the scatter component by sector integration. The input for the calculations consists of measured narrow- and broad-beam transmitted fractions through lead in air for various circular fields, thicknesses of the attenuator, and angles from the central axis, in a geometry approximating typical treatment conditions. The method has been tested for the case of a uniform half slab and a 45 degree wedge in a 4-MV photon beam. It was found that the use of TR values obtained by the above method reduced the maximum absorbed dose computation error from 8% computed with a commercially available algorithm to 3%, in a typical treatment setup. This method is generally applicable to any shaped attenuator such as a wedge or compensator covering whole or part of a radiation field	
2511	Charged particle radiotherapy of selected tumors in the head and neck	Adult, California, Californium, Carbon, Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Ions, Kinetics, Male, Middle Aged, Neck, Neon, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Silicon, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Universities	For selected tumors in some sites in the head and neck region, charged particles such as protons or helium, carbon, neon and silicon ions provide improved dose distributions, higher tumor doses, and an increased chance of local control and prolonged survival. In tumors with "radioresistant" histologies, slow growth kinetics and/or hypoxic cells, the high-LET component of neon or silicon ions may also offer and added potential for increased effect on tumors. Sixty-seven (67) evaluable patients with tumors in the head and neck region having a histology other than squamous carcinoma received partial or full treatment with charged particles at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The tumor sites included base of skull or cervical spine, salivary glands, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, and miscellaneous sites such as lacrimal gland, soft tissues of the neck, or thyroid. Follow-up ranges from 1-9 years with a mean of 36 months and a median survival (Kaplan-Meier technique) of 50 months. The actuarial local control rate is 60% at 24 months post-treatment. Thirty-one (31) patients with squamous carcinoma of various sites in the head and neck have also been treated using charged particle irradiation; local control was lower (11 of 31 pts) and survival shorter (mean: 9 months) in this group of patients with advanced squamous carcinoma

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HCC for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy. Four patients had renal failure, 2 patients had severe heart disease, 9 patients had severe cirrhosis, 1 patient had aplastic anemia, 1 patient had a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm before treatment, and 4 patients had bleeding tendency or unresectable tumors. Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to iodine, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the tumors ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm). No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for tumor treatments. RESULTS: All but 1 of the irradiated tumors were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years. Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant metastases in the lungs. Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and all recurrent tumors were controlled. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively. Grade > or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with HCC. The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with HCC who had limited treatment options. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society	
1092	Megavoltage computed tomography imaging: a potential tool to guide and improve the delivery of thoracic radiation therapy	Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/ra [Radiography], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Tomography,Spiral Computed/is [Instrumentation]	Helical tomotherapy is an innovative means of delivering intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using a device that merges features of a linear accelerator and a helical computed tomography (CT) scanner. The tomotherapy unit can generate CT images from the megavoltage radiation it uses for treatment as often as needed during a course of radiation therapy. These megavoltage CT (MVCT) images offer verification of patient position prior to and potentially during radiation therapy, and provide considerably more anatomical detail than the conventional radiation therapy port films used for patient set-up verification. Also, MVCT imaging may enable reconstruction of the radiation dose delivered, thereby providing unprecedented verification of the actual treatment. These key features of helical tomotherapy distinguish it from other IMRT approaches. We report results from a pilot feasibility trial of 10 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on whom we obtained MVCT images using a prototype helical tomotherapy system. All patients underwent conventional CT imaging for radiation therapy treatment planning. Specific aims were to subjectively compare MVCT and conventional CT images and then to objectively compare the 2 modalities by contouring tumors and performing a volumetric comparison. Seven patients had disease located primarily in the lung parenchyma, 2 primarily in the mediastinum, and 1 in both. When evaluated by location, all 7 patients with lesions primarily in the lung parenchyma had subjectively high-quality MVCT images. Objectively, the volumetric agreement between conventional and MVCT for parenchymal lesions was excellent in 5 of the 7 patients. Megavoltage CT imaging via the helical tomotherapy prototype provided adequate information for use in verification of patient position and dose reconstruction for lesions within the pulmonary parenchyma, but presently appears suboptimal for primarily mediastinal disease. Further studies are ongoing to optimize MVCT imaging and better define its utility in patients with NSCLC

However, in-house verification of source strength is required at some institutions by state law or internal policy, is recommended by the AAPM TG 60 report on intravascular brachytherapy, and is considered a necessity by many medical physicists. To accommodate the long sources used in intravascular therapy, special well chambers with extended regions of constant response have been designed. To allow assays using a widely available standard well chamber, we have measured its position dependent sensitivity and derived from it a table of correction factors that account for the extended length of intravascular sources. An experimental verification shows that application of these correction factors yields assays with sufficient accuracy for routine quality assurance tests	
27	Bremsstrahlung production from a linac target in the presence of external magnetic fields	Biophysics, Electrons, Humans, Magnetics, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,High-Energy	A method to increase the photon fluence of the linac is to apply a magnetic field to the bremsstrahlung producing electrons in the target. This field changes the electron paths, and therefore the photon trajectories. In this research Monte Carlo techniques are used to model the effect of three separate magnetic field configurations applied to a tungsten target, on the forward projection of bremsstrahlung created from incident 6 MeV electrons. A radial fluence spectrum is produced for each magnetic field. The maximum increase in fluence is shown to be around 10% for a physically possible field. We conclude that the cost of constructing and installing such magnets (currently) outweighs the small increase in fluence yield

To characterize the cellular and molecular effects of these hadrons, we performed dose-response and time-course experiments by exposing different cell lines (PC3, Ca301D, MCF7) to increasing doses of protons and examining them with FACS, RT-PCR, and electron spin resonance (ESR). Irradiation with a dose of 10 Gy of a 26,7 Mev proton beam altered cell structures such as membranes, caused DNA double strand breaks, and significantly increased intracellular levels of hydroxyl ions, are active oxygen species (ROS). This modified the transcriptome of irradiated cells, activated the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis, and resulted in cycle arrest at the G2/M boundary. The number of necrotic cells within the irradiated cell population did not significantly increase with respect to the controls. The effects of irradiation with 20 Gy were qualitatively as well as quantitatively similar, but exposure to 40 Gy caused massive necrosis. Similar experiments with photons demonstrated that they induce apoptosis in a significantly lower number of cells and in a temporally delayed manner. These data advance our knowledge on the cellular and molecular effects of proton irradiation and could be useful for improving current hadrontherapy protocols

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2000, 33 patients with head and neck malignancies but no history of surgical resection were treated with 250-MeV protons with or without X-ray irradiation. This study retrospectively evaluated local control, survival, and treatment sequelae of these patients. The median total target dose using protons with or without X-rays was 76 Gy (range: 42-99 Gy) and the median proton dose per fraction 2.8 Gy (range: 1.5-6.0 Gy). RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival and local control rates were 44% and 74%, respectively. One (3%) and six patients (18%) suffered from treatment-related acute and late toxicity > grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria). One patient with a history of radiotherapy suffered from acute toxicity > grade 3. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy appeared to offer high local control rates with few toxicities relative to conventional radiotherapy. However, late toxicity was seen in areas where large radiation doses had been given

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities.

[Review] [27 refs]	Abdomen, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Brachytherapy, Brain, Efficiency, Electrons, Head, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Lymphoma, Mediastinum, Methods, Neck, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Time	The 5 years' survival rate of all cancer patients is 35-45%. In that survival rate radiotherapy takes part in 15%. By further development of radiological methods and techniques radiotherapy gains significance in the recent time. Optimizing radiation planning and tactics, all modern imaging techniques are applied consequently. The radiotherapist must be able to asses their immanent specifity which should remain object of the radiological training, even if separated into therapy and diagnostics. Dose distribution is calculated by computer; three-dimensional planning is done in tumors of the mediastinum, oesophagus carcinoma and paraaortic lymphomas. Critical description of radiation techniques, results, problems and prognoses are given by results in tumors of the epipharynx and gastric cancer. After-loading, done until now only in gynaecological tumors, is performed in recurrences of pharyngeal tumors by individually shaped applicators. Reducing the number of therapy failures as well as possible, the application of higher tumor doses, new kinds of rays as neutrons and combinations with physical and chemical methods is outlined. Modifications of radiation volumes are discussed, especially the irradiation of the complete abdomen in ovarian cancer, the irradiation of the complete body surface by electrons in mycosis fungoides, and the total body irradiation prior to autologue bone marrow transplantation. Modifications of fractionation are shown in short-time radiation of bone metastases and single-time radiation of brain lesions. Low penetrating electron therapy facilitates intraoperative single-time irradiation. Because of higher biological efficiency neutrons and heavy ions allow to irradiate low sensible tumors or recurrences embedded in fibrotic tissue respectively. The combination with hyperthermia yields good results in tumors of the head and neck with better local response and total remissions of 59%. There are potentials in synchronising with chemotherapeutics. Remissions of different duration were achieved in 190 patients. Because of neutrotoxicity there are still problems in applicating radiosensitizers. New methods are applied treating endocrine active tumors by labelled hormone precursers. [References: 27]	
246	Inhibition of potential lethal damage repair and related gene expression after carbon-ion beam irradiation to human lung cancer grown in nude mice	Animals, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], DNA Damage, DNA Repair, DNA Repair/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Gene Expression Regulation,Neoplastic/ge [Genetics], Gene Expression Regulation,Neoplastic/re [Radiation Effects], Heavy Ions, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/ge [Genetics], Mice, Mice,Nude, Radiation Dosage, Radioisotopes	Using cultured and nude mouse tumor cells (IA) derived from a human lung cancer, we previously demonstrated their radiosensitivity by focusing attention on the dynamics of tumor clonogens and the early and rapid survival recovery (potential lethal damage repair: PLD repair) occurring after X-ray irradiation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating gene expression in association with PLD repair after carbon-ion beam or X-ray irradiation to cancer cells. In this study we tried to detect the mechanism of DNA damage and repair of the clonogens after X-ray or carbon-ion beam irradiation. At first, colony assay method was performed after irradiation of 12 Gy of X-ray or 5 Gy of carbon-ion beam to compare the time dependent cell survival of the IA cells after each irradiation pass. Second, to search the genes causing PLD repair after irradiation of X-ray or carbon-ion beam, we evaluated gene expressions by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR with the selected 34 genes reportedly related to DNA repair. The intervals from the irradiation were 0, 6, 12 and 24 hr for colony assay method, and 0, 3, 18 hr for RT-PCR method. From the result of survival assays, significant PLD repair was not observed in carbon-ion beam as compared to X-ray irradiation. The results of RT-PCR were as follows. The gene showing significantly higher expressions after X-ray irradiation than after carbon-ion beam irradiation was PCNA. The genes showing significantly lower expressions after X-ray irradiation rather than after carbon-ion beam irradiation were RAD50, BRCA1, MRE11A, XRCC3, CHEK1, MLH1, CCNB1, CCNB2 and LIG4. We conclude that PCNA could be a likely candidate gene for PLD repair	
549	A fourier analysis on the maximum acceptable grid size for discrete proton beam dose calculation	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Finite Element Analysis, Fourier Analysis, Humans, Models,Biological, Protons, Protons/du [Diagnostic Use], Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Sample Size, Sensitivity and Specificity, Water	We developed an analytical method for determining the maximum acceptable grid size for discrete dose calculation in proton therapy treatment plan optimization, so that the accuracy of the optimized dose distribution is guaranteed in the phase of dose sampling and the superfluous computational work is avoided. The accuracy of dose sampling was judged by the criterion that the continuous dose distribution could be reconstructed from the discrete dose within a 2% error limit. To keep the error caused by the discrete dose sampling under a 2% limit, the dose grid size cannot exceed a maximum acceptable value. The method was based on Fourier analysis and the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem as an extension of our previous analysis for photon beam intensity modulated radiation therapy [J. F. Dempsey, H. E. Romeijn, J. G. Li, D. A. Low, and J. R. Palta, Med. Phys. 32, 380-388 (2005)]. The proton beam model used for the analysis was a near monoenergetic (of width about 1% the incident energy) and monodirectional infinitesimal (nonintegrated) pencil beam in water medium. By monodirection, we mean that the proton particles are in the same direction before entering the water medium and the various scattering prior to entrance to water is not taken into account. In intensity modulated proton therapy, the elementary intensity modulation entity for proton therapy is either an infinitesimal or finite sized beamlet. Since a finite sized beamlet is the superposition of infinitesimal pencil beams, the result of the maximum acceptable grid size obtained with infinitesimal pencil beam also applies to finite sized beamlet. The analytic Bragg curve function proposed by Bortfeld [T. Bortfeld, Med. Phys. 24, 2024-2033 (1997)] was employed. The lateral profile was approximated by a depth dependent Gaussian distribution. The model included the spreads of the Bragg peak and the lateral profiles due to multiple Coulomb scattering. The dependence of the maximum acceptable dose grid size on the orientation of the beam with respect to the dose grid was also investigated. The maximum acceptable dose grid size depends on the gradient of dose profile and in turn the range of proton beam. In the case that only the phantom scattering was considered and that the beam was aligned with the dose grid, grid sizes from 0.4 to 6.8 mm were required for proton beams with ranges from 2 to 30 cm for 2% error limit at the Bragg peak point. A near linear relation between the maximum acceptable grid size and beam range was observed. For this analysis model, the resolution requirement was not significantly related to the orientation of the beam with respect to the grid	
2871	Photon beams for radiosurgery produced by laser Compton backscattering from relativistic electrons	Angiography, Coronary Angiography, DNA, Efficiency, Electrons, Humans, Italy, Lasers, Light, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Neurosurgery/mt [Methods], Nuclear Physics, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Skull, Time	The frontal collisions of a laser beam with relativistic electrons result in Compton-backscattered photons. The energy of these photons is dependent on the laser and electron energy in the range from kilo-electron-volts to tens of mega-electron-volts. In a sufficiently narrow backscattering angle the photons are nearly monochromatic. Over the past 30 years there have been several attempts to produce photon beams by laser backscattering from relativistic electrons stored in magnetic ring structures. One aim is to produce photons in the high mega-electron-volt energy range with fluxes useful for nuclear physics research; another is to produce photons in the high kilo-electron-volt energy range, which would be useful for medical applications, such as coronary angiography or treatment of tumour. Our present interest is to investigate the possibility of using 34 keV to 10 MeV photon beams for applications in stereotactic functional radiosurgery. We foresee the possibility of neurosurgical operations through the intact skull with precise and effective destruction of deeply lying millimetre-sized targets with minimal effects on intervening structures, high reproducibility and good prediction of the results. Our paper presents: a Monte Carlo study of radiosurgery based on cross firing with 34 keV to 100 MeV photon beams and 200 and 580 MeV proton beams, a theoretical description of the kinematics of Compton backscattering and estimates of the backscattered photon flux from several combinations of laser cavities at Nd:YAG (1.17 eV) and CO2 (0.117 eV) laser energies and electron storage rings energies in the range 0.1-1.3 GeV. As examples, existing magnetic structures, such as the DA phi NE Accumulator in the lower energy range and the Trieste Synchrotron Light Source ELETTRA in the higher energy range have been utilized in the calculations. The Monte Carlo study has shown that radiosurgery with photon beams of energies in mega-electron-volt energy range enables precise destruction of deeply lying millimetre-sized targets with minimal effects on intervening structures. Its precision is comparable to that of radiosurgery with 200-580 MeV proton beam, but our hope is that radiosurgery with lower energy photon beams could be more precise and less expensive. An average dose of 200 Gy can be delivered to a target of diameter 2 mm at the centre of an 18 cm diameter phantom in 1 h using photon beams of fluences 7.3 x 10(10), 1.8 x 10(10), 6.5 x 10(8), 2.2 x 10(8), 8.6 x 10(7) and 7.8 x 10(6) photons per second at 34 keV, 100 keV, 1 MeV, 3 MeV, 10 MeV and 100 MeV per cross section of beam of 2 mm diameter, respectively. 34-100 keV photon beams were studied in the hope of finding a strong enhancement of their efficiency if a stable high-Z element were to be introduced into the target's DNA. It is shown that, with a low-energy ring running at about 0.4 GeV and a Nd:YAG laser, it would be possible to obtain the required 3 MeV photon beam flux to deliver the average dose within 1 h, assuming an average distance between the source and the target of about 5 m. With a similar machine used at about 1.3 GeV and a CO2 laser, a 3 MeV photon beam is obtained and the exposure time can be reduced to less than 1 min, assuming a roughly 10 m distance between source and target (here a beam angle of 0.1 mrad only had to be considered due to the larger angular energy and yield spread). With a lower electron energy of 138 MeV and a CO2 laser, a 34 keV photon beam can be produced. More than 45 h would be needed to deliver the same dose. We hope that this time could be shortened considerably if stable iodine were introduced into the target with the help of a DNA-seeking molecular carrier. In this case the geometrical precision would be further improved	
2090	Tumor control probability model for alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides	Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Animals, Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Size/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Models,Statistical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Stochastic Processes, Survival, Universities	Alpha-particle emitters are currently being evaluated for the treatment of metastatic disease. The dosimetry of alpha-particle emitters is a challenge, however, because the stochastic patterns of energy deposition within cellular targets must be taken into account. We propose a model for the tumor control probability of alpha-particle emitters which takes into account these stochastic effects. An expression for cell survival, which is a function of the microdosimetric single-event specific-energy distribution, is multiplied by the number of cells within the tumor cluster. Poisson statistics is used to model the probability of zero surviving cells within the cluster. Based on this analysis, a number of observations have been made: (1) The dose required to eradicate a tumor is nearly a linear function of the cell survival parameter z(0). (2) Cells with smaller nuclei will require more dose to achieve the same level of tumor control probability, relative to cells with larger nuclei, for an identical source-target configuration and cell sensitivity. (3) As the targeting of alpha-particle emitters becomes more specific, the dose required to achieve a given level of tumor control decreases. (4) Additional secondary effects include cell shape and the initial alpha-particle energy

If radiolabeled without loss of immunologic specificity, such antibodies may be able to deliver cytoxic amounts of radiation. Target-cell specificity and a high extraction coefficient are necessary with any radionuclide in order to minimize normal tissue irradiation. Tumor-cell-retention time and the rate of catabolized radionuclide will also influence ultimate applicability. Among the unanswered questions for choosing a radionuclide is the choice of particle emitter. Although classic beta emitters have been used in a number of clinical situations, they have not had a major impact on disease outcome except in diseases of the thyroid. Unfortunately, Auger emitters such as iodine 125 are cytotoxic only when localized within close proximity to the genome. On the other hand, alpha emitters such as astatine 211 eliminate the need for subcellular sequestration but not cell-specific localization. [References: 34]	
772	The Monte Carlo SRNA-VOX code for 3D proton dose distribution in voxelized geometry using CT data	Algorithms, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Electrons, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Normal Distribution, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiographic Image Enhancement, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Software, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	This paper describes the application of the SRNA Monte Carlo package for proton transport simulations in complex geometry and different material compositions. The SRNA package was developed for 3D dose distribution calculation in proton therapy and dosimetry and it was based on the theory of multiple scattering. The decay of proton induced compound nuclei was simulated by the Russian MSDM model and our own using ICRU 63 data. The developed package consists of two codes: the SRNA-2KG, which simulates proton transport in combinatorial geometry and the SRNA-VOX, which uses the voxelized geometry using the CT data and conversion of the Hounsfield's data to tissue elemental composition. Transition probabilities for both codes are prepared by the SRNADAT code. The simulation of the proton beam characterization by multi-layer Faraday cup, spatial distribution of positron emitters obtained by the SRNA-2KG code and intercomparison of computational codes in radiation dosimetry, indicate immediate application of the Monte Carlo techniques in clinical practice. In this paper, we briefly present the physical model implemented in the SRNA package, the ISTAR proton dose planning software, as well as the results of the numerical experiments with proton beams to obtain 3D dose distribution in the eye and breast tumour

Simulation calculations were carried out by means of MCNP-4B transport code for candidate BDE materials, namely, (C2H4)n, (C2H3F)n, (C2H2F2)n, (C2HF3)n, (C2D4)n, (C2F4)n, beryllium metal, graphite, D2O and 7LiF. Dose protocols applied were those used for intra-operative BNCT treatment for brain tumour currently used in Japan. The maximum TPD (TPDmax) for each BDE material was found to be between 4 cm and 5 cm in the order of (C2H4)n < (C2H3F)n < (C2H2F2)n < (C2HF3)n < beryllium metal < (C2D4)n < graphite < (C2F4)n < D2O < 7LiF. Based on the small and arbitrary variations in the TPDmax for these materials, an explicit advantage of a candidate BDE material could not be established from the TPDmax alone. The dependence of TPD on BDE thickness was found to be influenced by the type of BDE material. For materials with hydrogen, sharp variations in TPD were observed, while those without hydrogen exhibited more moderate fluctuations in TPD as the BDE thickness was varied. The BDE thickness corresponding to TPDmax (BDE(TPDmax)) was also found to depend on the type of BDE material used. Thicker BDE(TPDmax), obtained mostly for BDE materials without hydrogen, significantly reduced the dose rates within the phantom. The TPDmax, the dependence of TPD on BDE thickness and the BDE (TPDmax) were ascertained as appropriate optimization criteria in choosing suitable BDE materials for BNCT. Among the candidate BDE materials considered in this study. (C2H4)n was judged as the suitable material for near-surface tumours and beryllium metal for deeper tumours based on these optimization criteria and other practical considerations

This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity. RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept	
1388	Analysis of complex-type chromosome exchanges in astronauts' lymphocytes after space flight as a biomarker of high-LET exposure	Astronauts, Biological Markers, Cell Cycle, Chromosomes/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Metaphase, Radiation, Space Flight, Time, Uncertainty	High-LET radiation is more efficient in producing complex-type chromosome exchanges than sparsely ionizing radiation, and this can potentially be used as a biomarker of radiation quality. To investigate if complex chromosome exchanges are induced by the high-LET component of space radiation exposure, damage was assessed in astronauts' blood lymphocytes before and after long duration missions of 3-4 months. The frequency of simple translocations increased significantly for most of the crewmembers studied. However, there were few complex exchanges detected and only one crewmember had a significant increase after flight. It has been suggested that the yield of complex chromosome damage could be underestimated when analyzing metaphase cells collected at one time point after irradiation, and analysis of chemically-induced PCC may be more accurate since problems with complicated cell-cycle delays are avoided. However, in this case the yields of chromosome damage were similar for metaphase and PCC analysis of astronauts' lymphocytes. It appears that the use of complex-type exchanges as biomarker of radiation quality in vivo after low-dose chronic exposure in mixed radiation fields is hampered by statistical uncertainties

The long-term side effects of treatment with high-energy X-rays (photons) can be substantial. Proton radiation therapy may limit these late effects. PROCEDURE: The physical difference between photon and proton irradiation is compared. The clinical benefits of the superior physical properties of proton beam radiation therapy are explained for children with brain tumors. RESULTS: At biologically equivalent doses, proton radiation therapy offers tumor control similar to photon radiation therapy. The superior physical properties of proton beams make this mode of radiation therapy less likely to cause late effects. CONCLUSIONS: For many children with brain tumors, proton beam radiation therapy may limit the late effects of radiation therapy and therefore offer an advantage over techniques using photons.

On a Mevatron accelerator, this option generates a wedge-like dose profile by moving a collimator jaw at constant speed while varying the dose rate. In this paper the formalism is given that is used to deliver a wedge profile and from that the expressions for possible combinations of wedge angle, field size and delivered MUs are derived. Also the time needed to deliver a VW field is calculated. An effective attenuation coefficient mu is used in the implementation. For three beam energies, values of mu are determined in order to get VW angles that are as close as possible to the hard wedge angles, over a wide range of field sizes and wedge angles. Linearity with number of MUs and gantry angle dependence of the generated dose profiles were checked. These factors did not have a significant influence on the VW dose profiles. Wedge factors should be close to unity in the VW implementation. We have measured a number of wedge factors and found that they start to deviate from 1 with more than 1% for large wedge angles and field sizes, up to 3.5% for a 19 x 19 cm2, 60 degrees VW field. The Virtual Wedge turned out to be a reliable tool that can be used clinically, provided that it can be handled by the treatment planning system. It provides extra flexibility and usually results in shorter beam on times

The radiation quality used was electron beams with an energy of about 12 MeV. The overall treatment time varied between 4 and 6 weeks. The two schedules were also compared for an overall treatment time of 10 weeks, with a rest period of 3 weeks after 4 weeks of irradiation, followed by another 3 weeks of treatment. With 5 to 6 weeks irradiation, daily fractions resulted in a significantly more pronounced skin erythema (p less than 0.05) than twice-a-week fractions, corresponding to about 10% in terms of absorbed dose. With 4 weeks irradiation and split-course therapy, the acute reactions were identical with both schedules. We interpret these findings as indicating a radiation-induced accelerated repopulation of the basal cells in the epidermis, with a fairly abrupt onset after 4 weeks. The higher effect after more frequent fractions of smaller size would be expected from a sensitizing effect of redistribution. In conclusion, the overall treatment time is of importance for establishment of iso-effect relationships for acutely responding tissues. The implication is that different fractionation parameters used in models to predict equivalent radiation effects of different fractionation schedules also vary significantly with the overall treatment time

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Confluent G0/G1 AG1522B cells were exposed to X-rays or 195MeV u(-1) C ions with a linear energy transfer of 16.6 keV microm(-1) in the dose range 1-4 Gy. Directly after irradiation, cells were reseeded at a low density in medium containing 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. At multiple time points post-irradiation, the cumulative BrdU-labelling index, mitotic index and aberration frequency were measured. Based on these data, the total amount of damage induced within the entire cell population was estimated by means of mathematical analysis. RESULTS: Both types of radiation exposure exert a pronounced effect on the cell cycle progression of fibroblasts. They result in delayed entry of cells into S-phase and into the first mitosis, and cause a dramatic reduction in mitotic activity. Measurement of chromosomal damage in first-cycle cells at multiple time points post-irradiation shows that the frequencies of aberrant cells and aberrations increase with time up to twofold for the lower doses. However, for the higher doses, this effect is less pronounced or even disappears. When the data for the whole cell population are analysed, it becomes evident that only a few damaged fibroblasts can progress to the first mitosis, a response attributable at least in part to a long-term arrest of injured cells in the initial G0/G1-phase. As observed in other investigations, the effectiveness of 195 MeV u(-1) C ions was similar or slightly higher than X-rays for all endpoints studied leading to a relative biological effectiveness in the range 1.0-1.4. CONCLUSIONS: Cell cycle arrests affect the aberration yield observable in normal human fibroblasts at mitosis. The data obtained for the cell population as a whole reveal that injured cells are rapidly removed from the mitotically active population through a chronic cell cycle arrest, which is consistent with other studies that indicate that this response is a specific strategy of fibroblasts to minimize the fixation and propagation of genetic alterations

It is therefore of importance to know these contributions quantitatively and to be able to scale them correctly as a function of Hounsfield units obtained from CT data. In this work, the second of these issues has been addressed. The importance of taking material-dependent nonelastic nuclear interactions into account has been investigated for Monte Carlo calculations. A scaling curve for nonelastic nuclear interactions as a function of Hounsfield unit has been established and compared with similar data for the stopping powers. Monte Carlo simulations using McPTRAN.MEDIA and MCNPX have been performed in homogeneous media and in inhomogeneous slab geometries. The results show that for skeletal tissues and for adipose tissue, the tissue to water nonelastic cross section ratios differ up to 10% compared to the tissue to water stopping power ratios. This results in errors of the order of 2-3% when both contributions to the total dose are scaled in the same way (with stopping power ratios). Monte Carlo simulations in slab geometries with tissue materials for 200 MeV protons show similar effects, but when both contributions are scaled correctly the errors are not larger than 0.5% in the situations investigated here

PB offer fast computation times, but are based on substantial approximations. Monte Carlo algorithms (MC) offer better accuracy, but are slower. We present a comparison of optimized treatment plans for six patients computed either with PB or MC. Both PB and MC are used during optimization, plus MC is used to recompute PB results. PB is used with different accuracy settings that define the coarseness of approximation. We evaluate the errors of PB optimized treatment plans via comparison with MC optimized plans (convergence errors) and MC recomputed plans (systematic errors) occurring for different accuracy settings of the PB. The level of lateral heterogeneities, being one of the main sources of inaccuracies of the PB, is quantified by a formula. In geometries with high levels of lateral heterogeneities, the shortcomings of PB are most obvious. For these geometries, simple PB lead to clinically significant differences and more accurate PB settings have to be used to diminish the error. The most accurate PB settings lead however to longer computing times by approximately a factor of 2 to 4 compared to PB with simple settings. Although the errors can be diminished, they cannot be fully eliminated even with sophisticated PB. Further gain in accuracy can therefore only be reached with MC in optimization. The use of MC in optimization is technically feasible, the computing times are however about 25 to 50 times longer compared to PB with most accurate settings	
3008	A method and contrast-detail phantom for the quantitative assessment of radiotherapy portal imaging systems	Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Quality Control, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Technology,Radiologic	Several designs of electronic portal imaging systems for radiotherapy have been reported or are now commercially available, as well as the familiar radiographic screen-film combinations. In order to evaluate imaging performance of these, and future, systems a prototype contrast-detail test object has been developed in conjunction with a method for determining contrast from a model of the X-ray spectra produced by linear accelerators. Several existing test objects rely on qualitative or semi-quantitative estimates of contrast. In this technique, quantitative estimates of contrast may be determined for each detail size from realistic estimates of the X-ray spectrum by using a spectral model either in conjunction with narrow-beam attenuation measurements on the linear accelerator used, or by using the nominal value of maximum photon energy. This technique should facilitate the comparison of imaging systems used with linear accelerators of different energies as well as providing a quantitative quality control tool for regular measurements of imaging performance. Examples of the use of the test object in the evaluation of several commercial screen-film combinations are given	
1184	Introduction of autopsy imaging redefines the concept of autopsy: 37 cases of clinical experience	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Autopsy/is [Instrumentation], Autopsy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Japan, Light, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/is [Instrumentation], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Research	A new autopsy imaging (AI) system was introduced at the Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy (RCCPT) in January 2000. Autopsy imaging is a postmortem and preautopsy diagnostic procedure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Scanning is performed with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system before autopsy. The AI results are reported to the pathologist and, in light of this information, autopsy is performed with minute precision. Autopsy imaging was performed on 37 cancer cases. In seven cases, AI was less informative than the autopsy, but in 30 cases, more precise reports on the final diagnosis were available with the combined application of autopsy and AI than autopsy alone, particularly in eight limited autopsy cases. Thus, AI provides critical and supplementary information for autopsy; furthermore, AI itself is a unique imaging system of great importance	
2785	Radiation enhancement with iodinated deoxyuridine	Animals, Brain, DNA, Electrons, Energy Transfer, Head, Humans, Idoxuridine, Idoxuridine/tu [Therapeutic Use], Linear Energy Transfer, Mice, Neck, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Regeneration, Research, X-Rays	A technique, Photon Activation Therapy (PAT), is described in which high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiations in the form of Auger electron distributions are generated by a photon beam through photoactivation of stable iodine incorporated as an analog of thymidine (Tyd) in DNA. Of the several halogenated deoxyribonucleosides evaluated, iodinated deoxyuridine (IdUrd) was found to be the only viable choice as a Tyd analog for PAT. Calculations show that 5% replacement of Tyd in tumor DNA multiplies the biologic effectiveness of a given photon radiotherapy dose by a factor of approximately 3. If further therapeutic advantages accorded to high LET radiations are taken into account, as well as repair and regeneration of normal tissues during protracted irradiations, an advantage of approximately 6 is realized. Five percent replacement of Tyd has already been reported for human tumor in vivo. Higher replacements of Tyd with IdUrd would provide proportionately greater advantages. The expectation is that previous clinical results with BrdUrd and high-energy X-rays can be significantly improved upon through the use of IdUrd and suitable lower energy activating photons (35-50 keV). In particular, it is suggested that protracted irradiations with implanted sources such as 145Sm or 145Pm may provide unique advantages at selected sites such as brain or head and neck tumors	
228	[Conjunctival melanoma at corneoscleral limbus on primary acquired melanosis. A case report]. [French]	Conjunctival Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Conjunctival Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Disease Progression, Humans, Limbus Corneae/pa [Pathology], Male, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Precancerous Conditions/pa [Pathology], Recurrence, Treatment Outcome	A 51-year-old Caucasian man consulted for a visual loss in the left eye due to corneal extension of a conjunctival melanoma. This conjunctival melanoma arose from primary acquired melanosis with atypia at the temporal corneoscleral limbus. The patient was treated using a combination of surgical excision with physical treatment by ocular proton therapy. Progression remained under control 11 months after treatment: no local tumour recurrence or metastasis was observed. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia must be regarded as a premalignant melanocytic lesion. Based on this case report, the authors focus on primary acquired melanosis and its risk of transformation to a conjunctival malignant melanoma	
3736	Field homogeneity of bevelled intraoperative electron beam cones: the influence of virtual focus surface distance	Electrons, Humans, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Methylmethacrylate, Methylmethacrylates, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radium	Field flatness of bevelled intraoperative electron therapy cones were evaluated from dose profiles, taken at dmax, both in the longitudinal plane (long axis direction) and the transversal plane (short axis direction), and were found to depend strongly on the setting of the x-ray collimators. Dose gradients in the longitudinal plane of 10-12% were found for collimator settings of 5 mm larger than the cone diameter for low energies, while the dose gradient were smaller for higher energies, both decreasing with larger collimator setting. The dose increase, relative to the central dose, of the hot spots observed in the profile of the transversal plane were in the range of 5-10% for high energies and large collimator settings, decreasing to less than 3% for low electron beam energies and smaller collimator setting. A decrease in virtual focus to surface distance (VFSD) was found to accompany the increasing dose gradient in the longitudinal plane with decreasing collimator setting, this due to increased scatter of electrons at collimator level. Increasing scatter with smaller collimator setting is also indicated by the increase in photon contamination ranging from 1-2.5% for low energies and 3.5-5% for high energies

These transformants were tumorigenic in athymic nude mice and tumors were transplantable into other nude mice. To further characterize processes involved in neoplastic progression, the tumor cell lines derived from these radiation-induced primary tumors were screened for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. p53 mutation was detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 8 inclusive. Mutations detected by SSCP analysis were confirmed by sequencing. Mutations were detected in all four exons analysed, although there was no correlation between dose, LET or mutation position or frequency. Mutations in p53 exons 6 and 7 have been reported in the childhood papillary thyroid carcinomas in Belarus presumably as a result of radioiodine fall-out. Similarly here, p53 mutations are induced experimentally during the development of human thyroid tumors generated by irradiation of a human thyroid epithelial cell line in vitro.

2517	Neon heavy charged particle radiotherapy of glioblastoma of the brain	Adult, Aged, Arm, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Californium, Cause of Death, Energy Transfer, Female, Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neon, Neon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Survival, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: High-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation beams have potential applications in the treatment of glioblastoma, but have not yet demonstrated significant improvement in results. However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation	
43	Independent verification using portal imaging of intensity-modulated beam delivery by the dynamic MLC technique	Biophysics, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]	The use of intensity-modulated radiation fields in radiotherapy treatment has been shown to have the potential to deliver highly conformal dose distributions. One technique for delivering these intensity-modulated beams is a computerized dynamic multileaf collimator (MLC). A major current impediment to the development of dynamic MLC therapy is verification of these highly complex treatments. Electronic portal imaging is shown here to be a solution to this verification problem. Experimental results are presented showing that leaf penumbra measured with a portal imager can be used to accurately define the positions of moving leaves. The random error in these leaf positions is compared with mean leaf positions along each leaf bank and specified leaf positions at prescription control points to check mechanical performance. Individual leaves are also checked for systematic motion errors. All leaf positions are found to be well within the manufacturer's specifications at all times. Finally, integral intensity images are presented that can be related to the dose distribution delivered. Portal imaging is shown to have the potential to become a valuable tool for the verification of dynamic MLC irradiation	
3809	[Neutron capturing irradiation: principle, current results and perspectives]. [Review] [145 refs] [French]	Borohydrides, Borohydrides/tu [Therapeutic Use], Boron, Boron Compounds, Boron Compounds/tu [Therapeutic Use], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/td [Trends], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Drug Carriers, France, Glioblastoma, Humans, Knowledge, Lead, Linear Energy Transfer, Melanoma, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Nuclear Reactors, Particle Accelerators, Phenylalanine, Phenylalanine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Phenylalanine/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation-Sensitizing Agents, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Sarcoma, Sulfhydryl Compounds/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Neutron capture irradiation aims to selectively destroy the tumoral cells with nuclear reactions produced inside themselves. Therefore, 10B is selectively carried into tumours, being linked to a molecular vehicle. The tissues are then irradiated with thermal neutrons, and the boron neutron capture leads to the formation of alpha and 7Li particles which produce high levels of radiolytic damage along their range of 10 microns. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) uses a thermal/epithermal neutron beam for irradiation, while boron neutron capture potentiation uses the addition of the captures in a fast neutron irradiation. A first trial, conducted in 1951 to 1961 in the USA to test BNCT on patients suffering of glioblastoma, was a failure, essentially because 10B was located in the cerebral capillaries rather than in the tumoral cells. Today, with great improvement in the boronated compounds which show an uptake preferentially inside the cells; the quality of neutron beams; and the knowledge of the microdosimetry of the technique, this technique may be clinically used to increase the local control of radioresistant tumours, like the high grade gliomas, cutaneous or uveal melanoma, and perhaps soft tissue sarcomas.

4484	Phase I/II study of proton beam irradiation for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration: treatment techniques and preliminary results	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Angiography, Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Humans, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Methods, Morbidity, Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Reading, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration is the prevalent etiology of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The only effective treatment is laser photocoagulation, which is associated with decreased visual acuity following treatment in most patients. This study assessed both the response of subfoveal CNV to proton beam irradiation and treatment-related morbidity. We evaluated preliminary results in patients treated with an initial dose of 8 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) using a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with subfoveal CNV received proton irradiation to the central macula with a single fraction of 8 CGE; 19 were eligible for evaluation. Treatment-related morbidity was based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria; response was evaluated by Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) guidelines. Fluorescein angiography was performed; visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and reading speed were measured at study entry and at 3-month intervals after treatment. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 15 months. RESULTS: No measurable treatment-related morbidity was seen during or after treatment. Of 19 patients evaluated at 6 months, fluorescein angiography demonstrated treatment response in 10 (53%); 14 (74%) patients had improved or stable visual acuity. With a mean follow-up of 11.6 months, 11 (58%) patients have demonstrated improved or stable visual acuity. CONCLUSION: A macular dose of 8 CGE yielded no measurable treatment morbidity in patients studied. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated that regressed or stabilized lesions were associated with improved visual acuity as compared with MPS results. In the next phase, a dose of 14 CGE in a single fraction will be used to further define the optimal dose fractionation schedule	
192	Utilization of thermoluminescent dosimetry in total skin electron beam radiotherapy of mycosis fungoides	Calibration, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Mycosis Fungoides/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Whole-Body Irradiation	PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to discuss the utilization of thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) in total skin electron beam (TSEB) radiotherapy to: (a) compare patient dose distributions for similar techniques on different machines, (b) confirm beam calibration and monitor unit calculations, (c) provide data for making clinical decisions, and (d) study reasons for variations in individual dose readings. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report dosimetric results for 72 cases of mycosis fungoides, using similar irradiation techniques on two different linear accelerators. All patients were treated using a modified Stanford 6-field technique. In vivo TLD was done on all patients, and the data for all patients treated on both machines was collected into a database for analysis. Means and standard deviations (SDs) were computed for all locations. Scatter plots of doses vs. height, weight, and obesity index were generated, and correlation coefficients with these variables were computed. RESULTS: The TLD results show that our current TSEB implementation is dosimetrically equivalent to the previous implementation, and that our beam calibration technique and monitor unit calculation is accurate. Correlations with obesity index were significant at several sites. Individual TLD results allow us to customize the boost treatment for each patient, in addition to revealing patient positioning problems and/or systematic variations in dose caused by patient variability. The data agree well with previously published TLD results for similar TSEB techniques. CONCLUSION: TLD is an important part of the treatment planning and quality assurance programs for TSEB, and routine use of TLD measurements for TSEB is recommended	
4481	T1 discrimination contributions to proton magnetization transfer in heterogeneous biological systems	Animals, Biochemistry, Body Water, California, Californium, Chemistry, Computer Simulation, Humans, Macromolecular Substances, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Protons, Research, Time, Universities, Water	Water proton spin-lattice relaxation times are commonly used as a guide in establishing the off-resonance irradiation time as well as the repetition time of the magnetization transfer experiment. T1 discrimination effects occur if the motionally restricted spin bath longitudinal magnetization does not reach thermal equilibrium. In this study we developed the formalism necessary for the evaluation of T1 discrimination contributions to proton magnetization transfer arising from the use of a short repetition time relative to the spin-lattice relaxation time of the motionally restricted spin bath. The results of computer simulation indicate that T1 discrimination contributions occur when the repetition time is small relative to the spin-lattice relaxation time of the motionally restricted spin bath, and when the off-resonance irradiation is weak and far off-resonance. For somewhat longer repetition times, T1 discrimination contributions become important only when the cross relaxation rate is small, and the fractional amount of motionally restricted component large. The occurrence of T1 discrimination effects results in distortion of water proton intensity ratio dispersion curves thereby resulting in the estimation of erroneous magnetization transfer parameters, whereas in magnetization transfer contrast enhanced imaging, such contributions are manifested by a decrease in image contrast	
2100	Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. XIII. Summary and synthesis of papers VI to XII and estimates of genetic risks in the year 2000. [Review] [40 refs]	Animals, Congenital Abnormalities/et [Etiology], Genetic Diseases,Inborn/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Japan, Mice, Mutagenesis, Mutation, Netherlands, Nuclear Warfare, Radiation, Radiation Genetics, Radiation,Ionizing, Research, Risk, Universities	This paper recapitulates the advances in the field of genetic risk estimation that have occurred during the past decade and using them as a basis, presents revised estimates of genetic risks of exposure to radiation. The advances include: (i) an upward revision of the estimates of incidence for Mendelian diseases (2.4% now versus 1.25% in 1993); (ii) the introduction of a conceptual change for calculating doubling doses; (iii) the elaboration of methods to estimate the mutation component (i.e. the relative increase in disease frequency per unit relative increase in mutation rate) and the use of the estimates obtained through these methods for assessing the impact of induced mutations on the incidence of Mendelian and chronic multifactorial diseases; (iv) the introduction of an additional factor called the "potential recoverability correction factor" in the risk equation to bridge the gap between radiation-induced mutations that have been recovered in mice and the risk of radiation-inducible genetic disease in human live births and (v) the introduction of the concept that the adverse effects of radiation-induced genetic damage are likely to be manifest predominantly as multi-system developmental abnormalities in the progeny.For all classes of genetic disease (except congenital abnormalities), the estimates of risk have been obtained using a doubling dose of 1 Gy. For a population exposed to low LET, chronic/ low dose irradiation, the current estimates for the first generation progeny are the following (all estimates per million live born progeny per Gy of parental irradiation): autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases, approximately 750-1500 cases; autosomal recessive, nearly zero and chronic multifactorial diseases, approximately 250-1200 cases. For congenital abnormalities, the estimate is approximately 2000 cases and is based on mouse data on developmental abnormalities. The total risk per Gy is of the order of approximately 3000-4700 cases which represent approximately 0.4-0.6% of the baseline frequency of these diseases (738,000 per million) in the population.

1378	Tumor basal area and metastatic death after proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma	Boston, Canada/ep [Epidemiology], Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Biological, Neoplasm Metastasis, Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mo [Mortality], Risk, Survivors, Time, United States/ep [Epidemiology]	BACKGROUND: Tumor dimension is an established prognostic factor for metastasis-related death after radiotherapy for uveal melanoma. OBJECTIVE: To compare various methods of modeling the relationship between tumor dimension and metastatic death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1204 patients with primary choroidal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between January 1985 and December 1998. Largest basal diameter and largest perpendicular basal diameter were recorded at the time of surgical placement of tantalum rings used for tumor localization during proton treatment. The height of the tumor and the axial diameter of the eye were measured by ultrasonography prior to treatment. Using proportional hazards regression, we compared the prognostic influence of different indices of tumor size with estimated risk ratios and death rates according to tumor basal area and largest basal diameter. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up annually through June 30, 2000. Of the 1204 patients analyzed, 193 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up among survivors was 7.9 years. The 5- and 10-year metastatic death rates were 12.8% and 20.7%, respectively. Among various approaches for modeling tumor dimension, the logarithm of tumor basal area had the highest log-likelihood and performed better than other approaches in 85% of the simulations. Based on this model, the covariate-adjusted rate ratio for any doubling in tumor basal area was 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.28). CONCLUSION: Tumor basal area is a better prognostic indicator than largest tumor diameter and tumor volume in the prediction of metastatic death after proton beam irradiation for uveal melanoma

Proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE), making use of the resonance reaction of 19F(p, alpha gamma)16O at 872 keV, and cyclic neutron activation analysis (CNAA), using the 19F(n, gamma)20F reaction in a reactor irradiation facility, were employed. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was used to calculate the volume, and, hence, mass of the sample excited in PIGE by determining the major element composition of the samples in order to express results in terms of concentration. From this preliminary investigation, a relationship is suggested between fluorine concentrations in bone and aluminium levels in the system

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290MeV/u), silicon (490MeV/u) and iron (200 and 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. PCC were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 min. RESULTS: The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components representing a rapid and a slow time constant. Chromatid breaks decreased rapidly during the first 10min after exposure, then continued to decrease at a slower rate. The rejoining kinetics were similar for exposure to each type of radiation. Chromatid exchanges were also formed quickly. Compared to low-LET radiation, isochromatid breaks were produced more frequently and the proportion of unrejoined breaks was higher for high-LET radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gamma-rays, isochromatid breaks were observed more frequently in high-LET irradiated samples, suggesting that an increase in isochromatid breaks is a signature of high-LET radiation exposure	
1286	An analytical dosimetry model as a step towards accounting for inhomogeneities and bounded geometries in 192Ir brachytherapy treatment planning	Absorption, Algorithms, Anisotropy, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Germany, Humans, Iridium Radioisotopes, Iridium Radioisotopes/an [Analysis], Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Biological, Photons, Physics, Radioisotopes, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/an [Analysis], Radiopharmaceuticals/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Water	A simple analytical dose rate calculation model based on primary and scatter separation that treats 192Ir as a monoenergetic source by use of appropriate attenuation and mass energy absorption coefficients is documented for accurate dosimetry in water. This model is then generalized and tested for use in any homogeneous tissue material of radiobiological interest using scatter to primary ratios calculated in water with a material density scaling to account for the difference in the scattering properties of these materials and water. The potential of the analytical model for predicting the effect of the interference of an inhomogeneity is then evaluated by comparison with corresponding Monte Carlo calculations. It is found that regardless of the inhomogeneity dimensions and position relative to the source, the model is capable of increased accuracy (better than 2%) in calculating the primary dose rate at any point not only for low-Z tissue materials but also for high-Z shielding materials where a severe hardening of the primary photons occurs. Overall, for low-Z tissue inhomogeneities the proposed model succeeds in correcting dosimetry results towards the right direction compared to commercial treatment planning systems that currently ignore the effect of phantom dimensions and inhomogeneity interference. Regarding high-Z shielding materials the proposed model accurately predicts the dose reduction just beyond the inhomogeneity (for example it predicts a dose reduction of 47% just behind a tungsten alloy cylinder of 1 cm diameter and 2 mm thickness placed at 1.4 cm away from an 192Ir source, in agreement with corresponding results in the literature) but does not account for the increasing contribution of the laterally scattered photons with increasing distance from the bounded inhomogeneity	
1266	Clinical dosimetry with MOSFET dosimeters to determine the dose along the field junction in a split beam technique	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Calibration, Humans, Lead, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Quality Control, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report on the accuracy of metal oxide-silicon semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors to measure dose distributions in the region of a field junction in a split beam technique, compared to ionisation chamber and photographic film. We present a study on five patients receiving loco-regional treatment for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose variation at the junction was measured with the patient dose verification system model TN-RD-50 (MOSFET system). Phantom measurements were performed to investigate the MOSFET accuracy in a half-field matching method and the influence of factors related to the accelerator. The aim of the patient measurements was to determine the effect of patient related factors on the dose at the junction over a period of 10 irradiation fractions. RESULTS: The MOSFET detector overestimates the dose in the junction area, therefore a correction factor was determined to correct the MOSFET results. Phantom measurements showed overdosages as well as underdosages, depending on the matching field direction (X or Y). Patient measurements showed dose values that deviated up to 133%+/-3% (2 S.D.). The average values of 10 irradiation sessions showed a continuous, almost linear, variation of dose value across the junction. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Significant dose deviations in the junction area average out over repeated treatments; (2) one individual measurement in the junction area should not lead to any action; (3) a linac QA procedure to check the dose at the junction line should simulate the clinical situation sufficiently; and (4) MOSFET dosimeters overestimate dose values in the penumbra region

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal human fetal lung (MRC-5), immortalized repair deficient ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (GM5,849C) and normal (GM637H) fibroblast cells were used. Colony-forming efficiency in bystander cells (GM637H) was studied using the medium transfer technique from the two donor (MRC-5 and GM5,849C) cells and the procedure followed for bystander treatment is presented schematically in Figure 1. Evidence of change in colony formation in bystander cells, was assessed by scavenging nitric oxide (NO). RESULTS: Enhancement of 10 - 30% in colony-forming efficiency was observed in bystander GM637H cells treated with irradiated conditioned medium (ICM) from MRC-5 cells collected 1 h after different doses of either gamma-rays (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 Gy) or alpha particles (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 Gy) irradiation. Similar results were obtained when ICM derived from the ATM (GM5,849C) cells. However, the stimulation was not dose dependent. Furthermore, we also show that the increase in dilutions of ICM (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10) showed an inverse correlation with cloning efficiency. Treatment of MRC-5 cells with PTIO (2-phenyl-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide) a NO scavenger, 1 h prior to irradiation reduced the enhancement of ICM mediated cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, though both the low and high LET radiations enhanced the clonogenic potential of the bystander recipient cells, medium from the ATM defective (GM5,849C) cells after gamma-irradiation showed less stimulating effect than the medium from the normal (MRC-5) cells. However, after alpha-irradiation an inverse effect was seen. NO may play an important role in enhancing the growth potential in these bystander cells

Neutrons are produced by bombarding a beryllium target with 65 MeV protons. A CNPF of 2.8 was adopted. As far as soft tissue sarcomas are concerned, 32 patients were irradiated after "radical" surgery: only 2 local recurrences were observed (follow-up from 6 months to more that 5 years). On the other hand, in a group of 26 patients with large inoperable, recurrent of incompletely resected tumours, local control could not be achieved in 14 cases. In the whole group of these 58 patients, 12 severe complications were observed; their frequency increases with field size which in turn reflects tumour extent. Locally extended prostatic adenocarcinomas (stage C) were treated with mixed schedule irradiation (3 neutron and 2 photon fractions per week). A local control rate of 93% at 1 year, of 83% at 2 years, and 90% at 3 years was achieved (28, 23 and 10 patients respectively). The early and late tolerance was excellent; only one complication was observed	
950	Dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy for locally advanced head-and-neck cancer.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Dose Fractionation, Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Time	PURPOSE: To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer in a Phase I/II dose escalation clinical trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

BANG polymer gels were irradiated with a quadratic field of monoenergetic 12C ions at different beam energies in the range of 135 MeV u(-1) to 410 MeV u(-1). They were irradiated at the radiotherapy facility of the GSI, Darmstadt, Germany. Our object was to examine the saturation effect for densely ionizing radiation that occurs at high values of linear energy transfer (LET). The examination yielded the first effectiveness values that will be discussed in the following sections. A solid sphere and a hollow sphere were both irradiated with a horizontal pencil beam from the raster scanning facility at energies of 268 MeV u(-1) (solid sphere) and 304 MeV u(-1) (hollow sphere) respectively. MR dosimetry measurements were compared with data from a planning system. As far as quality is concerned, there is good agreement between the measured dose distributions of both samples and the dose maps from the planning software. The measured MR signals cannot be converted into absolute dose, since the relative efficiency is still unknown for mixed radiation fields of primary carbon ions and it is known only to a limited extent for nuclear fragments with different energies from highly energetic photon radiation. Model calculations are in progress in order to facilitate conversions of measured MR signals into dose

In the assessment of retinal hemangioblastomas it is necessary to know about VHL, an autosomal dominant disease, a multisystem familial tumour syndrome. METHODS: An overview of the diagnosis and therapy of VHL is presented. RESULTS: Minimal criteria of the syndrome are tumours in one index patient and one of the typical lesions in another first-degree relative. Retinal hemangioblastomas were already found in children. Only 5 % of patients with VHL present retinal capillary hemangioma before the age of 10 years, and most patients present between the ages of 10 and 40 years. Data suggest that retinal capillary hemangioma is usually manifested by the age of 30 years. The VHL gene functions as a tumour suppressor gene and is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3p25. The mapping of a locus for VHL has offered the prospect of presymptomatic diagnosis of the disease using DNA markers. Small retinal tumours are treated by photocoagulation, big hemangioblastomas by cryotherapy. Modern options in treatment of retinal tumours are proton therapy, plaque radiotherapy, pars-plana vitrectomy, photodynamic therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy and systemic treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor, in addition. CONCLUSIONS: The interdisciplinary Freiburg VHL study which has been in existence for more than 20 years, has shown that an extensive family screening for early detection of the disease is necessary. The assessment of the diagnosis in a VHL carrier requires close follow-up for multiple and recurrent tumours. [References: 176]

A preliminary report	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/su [Surgery], Humans, Male, Pancreatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival, Survival Rate	Nineteen-patients with unresectable but localized ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with definitive high dose, small volume, external beam radiotherapy with promising results. The tumors of all patients were histologically confirmed. A 45 MV betatron was used for radiation of the clipped tumor volume plus a 1 to 2 cm margin. Fourteen patients were treated by a three-field technic with the use of opposed lateral photon beams and an anterior mixed photon-electron beam. Five patients were treated with either a four-field "box" or a three-field photon technic. Tumor doses of 5,900 to 6,700 r were delivered over seven to nine weeks. The twelve month survival rate after diagnosis is 53%. This compares favorably with published reports of patients treated surgically for cure. Four patients are alive 18.5 to 64 months after diagnosis. Three are clinically free of disease. Treatment has been well tolerated and there have been no significant radiation complications	
2142	Results of linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent and newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Hearing, Humans, Incidence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/mo [Mortality], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Ohio, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Risk, Safety	Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is used to treat acoustic neuromas, but additional information is needed to firmly establish its safety and efficacy. We review our experience over 7 years treating 29 consecutive patients with a modified linear accelerator (linac) SRS system. Between August 1989 and October 1995, 29 patients with a median age of 67 years (range 26 to 83) underwent linac SRS treatment. Twenty-five patients had unilateral acoustic neuromas, and four patients with neurofibromatosis type II had bilateral vestibular schwannoma. Eligibility criteria for SRS were recurrent tumors (n = 9), age >65 (n = 16), or patient preference (n = 6). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed on all patients. The most common presenting symptoms were hearing impairment (18 patients) and gait difficulties (17 patients). Ten patients were deaf in the affected ear prior to treatment. Doses to the periphery of the tumor ranged from 800 to 2,400 cGy (median 1, 600 cGy) prescribed to the 50% to 80% isodose line (median 80%). After a median radiographic follow-up of 49 months (range 4 to 110 months), 11 tumors were smaller, 17 were stable, and one had evidence of progression (at 41 months). The 5-year local disease control rate (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 94%. Acute complications were minimal, with only two patients experiencing nausea and vomiting after the procedure. Long-term complications included new or progressive trigeminal and facial nerve deficits with estimated 5-year incidences of 15% and 32%, respectively. Subjective hearing reduction or loss occurred in 14 (74%) of the 19 patients who had useful hearing prior to treatment. Five patients died from unrelated causes. These results suggest that linac SRS provides excellent short-term tumor control rates. Since there was a high risk of cranial nerve neuropathy, we do not recommend using only computed tomography-based planning and high prescription doses. Int. J. Cancer (Radiat. Oncol.

It has been known for some time that the nuclear interactions of the incident ions must be taken into account both in treatment planning and in understanding and addressing the effects of galactic cosmic ray ions on humans in space. Until relatively recently, most of the studies of nuclear fragmentation and transport in matter were driven by the interests of the nuclear physics and later, the hadron therapy communities. However, the experimental and theoretical methods and the accelerator facilities developed for use in heavy ion nuclear physics are directly applicable to radiotherapy and space radiation studies. I will briefly review relevant data taken recently at various accelerators, and discuss the implications of the measurements for radiotherapy, radiobiology and space radiation research	
2493	Present status of boron neutron capture therapy. [Review] [97 refs]	Boron, Boron Compounds, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron/tu [Therapeutic Use], Clinical Trials as Topic, DNA, Humans, Hydrogen, Isotopes, Ligands, Melanoma, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Nitrogen, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Sweden, Universities	The neutron capture reaction 10B(1n,4He)7Li produces two energetic particles, 4He2+ and 7Li3+ that are strongly cell toxic. Due to the short range of these nuclear fragments (5-9 microns) mainly those cells that have bound or internalized a 10B-containing substance are growth-inactivated. The most critical and difficult step in an efficient boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is the tumour targeting. It is today possible to synthesize a large number of boron compounds and conjugate them to tumour-seeking macromolecules, such as monoclonal antibodies or different polypeptides. The boron-containing substances presently considered for therapy are sulfhydryl boron hydride (BSH) and boron-phenylalanine, (BPA) for the treatment of gliomas and malignant melanomas respectively. Other boronated compounds considered are ligands for receptor-amplified tumour cells, antibodies for tumour cells with specific antigens and thioureas for treatment of melanotic melanomas. The required boron concentration is given by the relative dose due to neutron capture in 10B and that of the competing capture reactions in nitrogen and hydrogen. Capture in nitrogen produces protons with a range of about 10-11 microns and this gives a radiation dose to all cells in the neutron activated area. Calculations show that the local concentration of 10B near the critical radiation target, DNA, must be higher than 10 ppm (10 micrograms/g). Increased emphasis will be put on the development of combinations of treatments that fulfil the requirements for attacking the microscopic spread of the tumour. [References: 97]

METHODS: Retrospective review of 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. Several parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis techniques were used. RESULTS: In 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma, the mean dimension for largest basal diameter was 11.9 mm (range 5 mm to 24 mm). The mean tumor thickness was 6.7 mm (range 1.3 mm to 14.2 mm). Following helium ion radiation 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. At 10 years after radiation 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes were enucleated; the majority (37 of 46) of enucleations were due to anterior ocular segment complications. At 10 years after radiation 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; half had non-tumor related deaths and 51 died from metastatic melanoma. Best corrected visual acuity after radiation was > or = 20/40 in 21 of 93 eyes of patients that were alive and retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors that were less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm away from the nerve or the fovea, 13 of 18 (72%) retained > or = 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of acuity. The actuarial enucleation rate at 5 years was 17.2% (2.7% S.E.) and at 10 years this was 22.4% (3.1% S.E). The recurrence tumor control rate at both 5 and 10 years was 5.3% (S.E 1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion radiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In tumors that are less than 6 mm in thickness and greater than 3 mm from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision. Approximately one-half of the deaths 10 years after treatment were due to non-tumor-related causes	
2260	Alpha particle mutagenesis of human lymphoblastoid cell lines	Alpha Particles, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosome Deletion, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/ge [Genetics], Loss of Heterozygosity, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutagenesis, Mutation, Radiation, Research, Survival, Thymidine Kinase/ge [Genetics], X-Rays	Despite being derived from the same donor, the human lymphoblastoid cell lines WTK1 and TK6 have markedly different responses to low LET radiation. We originally observed that WTK1 was more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of X-irradiation, but significantly more sensitive to mutation induction at both the TK and HPRT loci. In an effort to better understand these properties, we have examined the effects of alpha-particles on these cells. Relative to TK6, WTK1 has enhanced survival and mutation after both X-ray and alpha-particle exposure. While the HPRT locus was significantly more mutable in WTK1 as a function of alpha-particle versus X-ray dose, the TK locus was only slightly more sensitive to alpha-particle mutagenesis. In addition, the slowly growing TK mutants that constitute the majority of X-ray-induced TK mutants of TK6 were recovered in lower proportions following alpha-particle exposures. This is consistent with the further finding that in both cell lines, loss of heterozygosity occurred in a smaller fraction of alpha-induced TK mutants than X-ray-induced mutants. These results are consistent with our previous model suggesting that WTK1 has an error-prone repair pathway that is either missing or deficient in TK6, and further suggest that this pathway may be involved in the processing of alpha-particle-induced damage	
675	Proton beam radiotherapy versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: A comparative study	Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Germany, Humans, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study was undertaken between proton and photon therapy in uveal melanoma to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. A fixed proton horizontal beam (OPTIS) and intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT), with multiple noncoplanar beam arrangements, was compared with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), using a static and a dynamic micromultileaf collimator and intensity-modulated RT (IMRS). METHOD AND MATERIALS: A planning CT scan was performed on a brain metastasis patient, with a 3-mm acquisition slice spacing and the patient looking at a luminous spot with the eyes in three different positions (neutral and 25 degrees right and left). Four different gross tumor volumes were defined for each treatment technique. These target scenarios represented different locations (involving vs. not involving the macula and temporal vs. nasal) and volumes (10 x 6 mm vs. 16 x 10 mm) to challenge the proton and photon treatment techniques. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 2 mm laterally and 3 mm craniocaudally for both modalities. A dose homogeneity of 95-99% of the planning target volume was used as the "goal" for all techniques. The dose constraint (maximum) for the organs at risk (OARs) for both the proton and the SRT photon plans was 27.5, 22.5, 20, and 9 CGE-Gy for the optic apparatus, retina, lacrimal gland, and lens, respectively. The dose to the planning target volume was 50 CGE-Gy in 10 CGE-Gy daily fractions. The plans for proton and photon therapy were computed using the Paul Scherrer Institute and BrainSCAN, version 5.2 (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) treatment planning systems, respectively. Tumor and OARs dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using the dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index (CI(95%)), and inhomogeneity coefficient. RESULTS: Target coverage of all simulated uveal melanomas was equally conformal with the photon and proton modalities. The median CI(95%) value was 1.74, 1.86, and 1.83 for the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively. With proton planning, the median CI(95%) was 1.88 for OPTIS and substantially improved with IMPT in some tumor cases (median CI(95%), 1.29). The tumor dose homogeneity in the proton plans was, however, always better than with SRT photon planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient 0.1 and 0.15 vs. 0.46, 0.41, and 0.23 for the OPTIS and IMPT vs. the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively). Compared with the photon plans, the use of protons did not lead to a substantial reduction in the homolateral OAR total integral dose in the low- to high-dose level, except for the lacrimal gland. The median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume with the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans was 33-30.8, 31.8-28, and 35.8-49 Gy, respectively, for the lacrimal gland, a critical organ. For protons, only the OPTIS plans were better, with a median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume using OPTIS and IMPT of 19.2 and 8.8 and 25.6 and 23.6 CGE, respectively. The contralateral OARs were completely spared with the proton plans, but the median dose delivered to these structures was 1.2 Gy (range, 0-6.3 Gy) with the SRT photon plans. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of SRT photon techniques, compared with protons, can result in similar levels of dose conformation. IMPT did not increase the degree of conformality for this small tumor. Tumor dose inhomogeneity was, however, always increased with photon planning. Except for the lacrimal gland, the use of protons, with or without intensity modulation, did not increase homolateral OAR dose sparing. The dose to all the contralateral OARs was, however, completely eliminated with proton planning

This technique is called dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery. Its main characteristic is simultaneous and continuous gantry and couch motion during the treatment procedure. It employs an isocentrically mounted linear accelerator as the source of radiation. Target localization is determined by digital subtraction angiography and CT. From results obtained in other centres, this technique has shown that an AVM less than 2.5 cm in diameter has an 85% chance of being completely obliterated within two years after a single treatment of stereotactic radiosurgery. This technique is suitable for those patients with inoperable, surgically inaccessible lesions, or whose current medical profile shows them to be high-risk candidates for surgical intervention

The 177Lu labeling of a macrocyclic bifunctional chelating agent viz. 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) has been extensively studied. Lanreotide, [beta-naphthyl-Ala-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2] a disulfide-linked cyclic octapeptide and a somatostatin analog, reported to bind with a wide variety of tumors expressing somatostatin receptors, was conjugated with DOTA. The peptide-BFCA conjugate was characterized with the help of high-resolution two-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy. The 177Lu labeling of the DOTA-lanreotide conjugate has been standardized to give a radiolabeling yield of 85%. The tracer showed specific binding with A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma and IMR-32 human brain neuroblastoma cells. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc	
3013	Precision and accuracy of stereotactic convergent beam irradiations from a linear accelerator	Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Research	PURPOSE: The accuracy and the precision for radiosurgery procedures at linear accelerator facilities were investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The technique of convergent beam irradiation, that is a series of successive isocentric arc irradiations, is specifically considered in this paper. Accuracy and precision depend on a sequence of methods and equipment among which localization of the target, patient alignment, and the dose delivery are the most critical steps. The purpose of the investigation was to quantitatively assess their contribution to the overall accuracy. The definitions and methods used to quantify and control accuracy are described. Measurements were carried out at a phantom to analyze the localization and positioning errors. Errors which may occur with the dose delivery technique were studied by a computer simulation. RESULTS: The calculations showed that these errors are not the main contributors to the overall accuracy as long as the linac inaccuracies are in the order or less than 1 mm. The accuracy found in the localization and positioning methods was less than 1 mm. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that an overall accuracy in the order of 1 mm can be obtained also under routine conditions. The great importance of adequate quality control is emphasized

This method allows to establish sudden parameter variations as well as to determine in a simple and precise manner long-term drifting effects with an amplitude within the range of measurement variations and a period of many months. During the time of six months, not only a drifting effect with a long period and an amplitude within the range of pro mille, but also a variation coefficient smaller than 0,3% could be determined

For skull base tumors, 10-year local control rates with combined proton-photon therapy are highest for chondrosarcomas, intermediate for male chordomas, and lowest for female chordomas (94%, 65%, and 42%, respectively). For cervical spine tumors, 10-year local control rates are not significantly different for chordomas and chondrosarcomas (54% and 48%, respectively), nor is there any difference in local control between males and females. Observed treatment-related morbidity has been judged acceptable, in view of the major morbidity and mortality which accompany uncontrolled tumor growth. [References: 46]

Dosimetry and design	Air, Calibration, Efficiency, Energy Transfer, Humans, Mathematics, Methods, Models,Structural, Parkinson Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards], Research, Technology,Radiologic, Time, Uncertainty	The purpose of the present work was to optimize and standardize irradiation conditions and dosimetry methods in order to investigate the prerequisites for the routine use of narrow high energy proton beams for cerebral radiation surgery. Particular importance was laid on the design of the arrangements for defining and controlling the path of the beam in the laboratory in view of the desirability of working with well-defined parallel beams containing a minimal contribution of scattered and secondary radiation. At the same time it was intended that this apparatus should be used to adjust the beam reproducibly onto an ideal beam path prior to each irradiation session. It was also considered desirable to be able to supervise the centering and the structure of the beam during the irradiations in view of the variations which can arise due to varying running conditions in the synchrocyclotron. The beam was collimated and led to the place where the irradiations were to be performed, 25 metres from the synchrocyclotron, with a system of focusing quadrupole magnets and bending magnets. Final collimation of the beam penetrating the object was arranged with a system of accurately aligned cylindrical and plane-parallel metal apertures. The energy of the protons in the beam was 185 +/- 0.2 MeV and the maximum total fluence was 5 X 10(10) protons/s. A method of 11C activation dosimetry was developed with which an absolute determination of the fluence and the dose in the proton beam could be made with good accuracy. These determinations were performed by irradiating small polystyrene cylinders placed along the beam axis at the isocentre. The activity induced in the cylinders by the protons was measured in a well-type crystal detector. The efficiency of the detector for the detection of annihilation photons was determined before each measurement by means of calibration with standardized activities of 22Na and 60Co. The overall uncertainty in the dose determinations using 11C activation dosimetry was +/- 8 per cent. Monitoring of the dose during irradiation was performed with an ionization chamber. Since it was most important to minimize the scattering of the protons, this chamber was designed as a 'free air chamber' with the electrodes parallel to the beam. The chamber could not be used for absolute measurements, however, since there was a contribution to the ionization in the chamber from scattered protons and secondary radiation from the walls of the collimator defining the cross section of the ionization volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

[Japanese]	Head, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Methods, Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Universities	Stereotactic radiosurgery using a Gamma unit obtains good results for small intracranial diseases, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and acoustic neurinoma. In stereotactic radiosurgery using a linear accelerator (LINAC), many fundamental problems are to be solved. 1) accuracy of a LINAC, 2) making the collimators for high energy X-ray narrow beams, 3) dosimetry for high energy X-ray narrow beams, 4) irradiation methods for stereotactic radiosurgery, 5) fixation of a patient's head and 6) simulation of a target. The usefulness of our method for simulation of a target and for positioning for radiosurgery was investigated. High energy X-ray narrow beams obtained with the collimators for narrow beams (field sizes: 9mm phi, 18mm phi and 27mm phi) satisfy clinical requirements for stereotactic radiosurgery, as indicated by dose profiles and isodose curves. No dosimetry method for high energy X-ray narrow beams has been established yet. Of the main irradiation methods for stereotactic radiosurgery, the method using multiple non-coplanar converging arcs needs no drastic reconstruction for use with LINAC. A patient's head was completely fixed by the stereotactic frame (Patil stereotaxic system or Leksell micro-stereotactic system). Simulation of a target was performed under CT scan. On CT image, the center of a target was determined and the three-dimensional coodinate on the stereotactic head frame target was settled so that the target would be reached. The three-dimensional coordinate for the target was coincided with the isocenter of a LINA by the laser beams of three-directional pointers. Afterwards, the target position was finely adjusted, by using the target positioner manipulator system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Review] [18 refs] [Japanese]	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Clinical Trials as Topic, Environment, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Japan, Massachusetts, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Photons, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Research, Science, Universities	In cancer radiotherapy, protons and heavy-ions share the same beneficial property of superior dose localization. In addition, heavy-ions are high-LET radiations and have increased biological effectiveness when compared with photons or protons. The potential indications for them are those diseases which are usually hard to cure with conventional radiations. At present there are 17 operating facilities world-wide for proton therapy, which in Japan is being conducted at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) and Tsukuba University (PMRC). Currently, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in USA and the National Cancer Institute East Hospital in Japan are building a hospital-based proton facility, both of them will have a fixed energy cyclotron (230MeV). New plans for commencing proton therapy are also proposed by many other institutions in the world. As with heavy-ion therapy, clinical trials have been carried out since 1994 using carbon-ions generated by HIMAC (Heavy-ion medical accelerator in Chiba) at NIRS. The HIMAC is the world's only heavy-ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. The Hyogo prefecture has just decided to build a similar ion therapy facility. As of February 1997, a total of 230 patients were treated in carbon-ion Phase I/II studies at NIRS. So far, carbon-ions appear to be effective in such cases as locally advanced tumors and non-squamous tumors. [References: 18]	
3871	Estimates of radiogenic cancer risks	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Air, Alpha Particles, Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Incidence, Infant,Newborn, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Mortality, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Skin, Time, Washington	A methodology recently developed by the U.S. EPA for estimating the carcinogenic risks from ionizing radiation is described. For most cancer sites, the risk model is one in which age-specific, relative risk coefficients are obtained by taking a geometric mean of the coefficients derived from the atomic bomb survivor data using two different methods for transporting risks from the Japanese to the U.S. population. The risk models are applied to estimate organ-specific risks per unit dose for a stationary population with mortality rates governed by 1980 U.S. vital statistics. With the exception of breast cancer, low-LET radiogenic cancer risk estimates are reduced by a factor of 2 at low doses and dose rates compared to acute high dose exposure conditions. For low dose (or dose rate) conditions, the risk of inducing a premature cancer death from uniform, whole body, low-LET irradiation is calculated to be 5.1 x 10(-2) Gy-1. Neglecting nonfatal skin cancers, the corresponding incidence risk is 7.6 x 10(-2) Gy-1. High-LET (alpha particle) risks are presumed to increase linearly with dose and to be independent of dose rate. High-LET risks are estimated to be 20 times the low-LET risks estimated under low dose rate conditions, except for leukemia and breast cancer where RBEs of 1 and 10 are adopted, respectively

When the photon energy exceeds the (gamma,n) reaction threshold energy, the patient receives an undesired dose due to photoneutron production both in the accelerator head and in the human body. In this paper, a method is presented for the assessment of the photoneutron spectra produced by Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) during cancer radiotherapy with energetic photon beams. Experimental and numerical results have been obtained for the facility at Onkologik Klinik, Lund (Sweden), which is based on an ELEKTA 18 MV LINAC. Neutron spectra are evaluated both at the patient plane and inside an anthropomorphic phantom

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

Two separate transport simulations were conducted, one for the photoneutron contribution and another for neutron capture gamma rays. The phantom model used was of a female patient receiving a four-field pelvic box treatment. Photoneutron doses were determinate to be higher for organs and tissues located inside the treatment field, especially those closest to the patient's skin. The maximum organ equivalent dose per x-ray treatment dose achieved within each treatment port was 719 microSv/Gy to the rectum (180 degrees field), 190 microSv/Gy to the intestine wall (0 degrees field), 51 microSv/Gy to the colon wall (90 degrees field), and 45 microSv/Gy to the skin (270 degrees field). The maximum neutron equivalent dose per x-ray treatment dose received by organs outside the treatment field was 65 microSv/Gy to the skin in the antero-posterior field. A mean value of 5 +/- 2 microSv/Gy was obtained for organs distant from the treatment field. Distant organ neutron equivalent doses are all of the same order of magnitude and constitute a good estimate of deep organ neutron equivalent doses. Using the risk assessment method of the ICRP-60 report, the greatest likelihood of fatal secondary cancer for a 70 Gy dose is estimated to be 0.02% for the pelvic postero-anterior field, the rectum being the organ representing the maximum contribution of 0.011%	
1569	Precise modelling of the eye for proton therapy of intra-ocular tumours	Berlin, Eye Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Germany, Humans, Models,Anatomic, Models,Biological, Models,Theoretical, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry, Research, Risk, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	A new method is described that allows precise modelling of organs at risk and target volume for radiation therapy of intra-ocular tumours. The aim is to optimize the dose distribution and thus to reduce normal tissue complication probability. A geometrical 3D model based on elliptic shapes was developed that can be used for multimodal model-based segmentation of 3D patient data. The tumour volume cannot be clearly identified in CT and MR data, whereas the tumour outline can be discriminated very precisely in fundus photographs. Therefore, a multimodal 2D fundus diagram was developed, which allows us to correlate and display simultaneously information extracted from the eye model, 3D data and the fundus photograph. Thus, the connection of fundus diagram and 3D data is well-defined and the 3D volume can be calculated directly from the tumour outline drawn onto the fundus photograph and the tumour height measured by ultrasound. The method allows the calculation of a precise 3D eye model of the patient, including the different structures of the eye as well as the tumour volume. The method was developed as part of the new 3D treatment planning system OCTOPUS for proton therapy of ocular tumours within a national research project together with the Hahn-Meitner-Institut Berlin

A computer controlled multileaf collimator (MLC) is being designed to improve efficiency and allow for the future development of intensity modulated radiation therapy with neutrons. For the current study the use of focused or unfocused collimator leaves has been studied. Since the engineering effort associated with the leaf design and materials choice impacts significantly on cost, it was desirable to determine the clinical impact of using unfocused leaves in the MLC design. The MRC is a useful tool for studying the effects of using focused versus unfocused beams on beam penumbra. The effects of the penumbra for the different leaf designs on tumor and normal tissue DVHs in two selected sites (prostate and head and neck) was investigated. The increase in the penumbra resulting from using unfocused beams was small (approximately 1.5 mm for a 5 x 5 cm2 field and approximately 7.6 mm for a 25 x 25 cm2 field at 10 cm depth) compared to the contribution of phantom scatter to the penumbra width (5.4 and 20 mm for the small and large fields at 10 cm depth, respectively). Comparison of DVHs for tumor and critical normal tissue in a prostate and head and neck case showed that the dosimetric disadvantages of using an unfocused rather than focused beam were minimal and only significant at shallow depths. For the rare cases, where optimum penumbra conditions are required, a MLC incorporating tapered leaves and, thus, providing focused collimation in one plane is necessary	
4433	Comparison of broad beam central axis depth dose curves from different accelerators using the universal depth dose curve model	Computers, Copper, Electrons, Family, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Water	Electron beam central axis depth dose distribution can be transformed to fluence distributions with geometric depth replaced by a measure of the state of angular dispersion of the beam. A transformed central axis depth dose distribution was called a 'fluence curve.' The transformation was applied to a set of central axis depth dose curves calculated by Monte Carlo code for broad electron beams of energies ranging from 1 to 60 MeV in homogeneous phantoms of water, aluminium, and copper. For the energies and compositions likely to be encountered in external beam radiation therapy, the resulting fluence curves, were found to belong to a single parameter family. A collimator scatter parameter was introduced to take into account the initial angular dispersion produced by the collimator of an accelerator. Given the energy of the beam, the medium in which the beam is passing through, and the collimator scatter parameter, the fluence curve associated with the beam can easily be transformed back to a calculated depth dose curve. The collimator scatter parameter necessary to fit the depth dose curves measured on different accelerators was investigated. The results for the Clinac 18, LMR-13, Mevatron XII, Mevatron 80, Microtron, Sagittaire, Siemens Betatron, and the Therac 20 are presented	
1673	A method of simulating dynamic multileaf collimators using Monte Carlo techniques for intensity-modulated radiation therapy	Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation, Texas, Universities	A method of modelling the dynamic motion of multileaf collimators (MLCs) for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was developed and implemented into the Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation of the dynamic MLCs (DMLCs) was based on randomizing leaf positions during a simulation so that the number of particle histories being simulated for each possible leaf position was proportional to the monitor units delivered to that position. This approach was incorporated into an EGS4 Monte Carlo program, and was evaluated in simulating the DMLCs for Varian accelerators (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto. CA, USA). The MU index of each segment, which was specified in the DMLC-control data, was used to compute the cumulative probability distribution function (CPDF) for the leaf positions. This CPDF was then used to sample the leaf positions during a real-time simulation, which allowed for either the step-shoot or sweeping-leaf motion in the beam delivery. Dose intensity maps for IMRT fields were computed using the above Monte Carlo method, with its accuracy verified by film measurements. The DMLC simulation improved the operational efficiency by eliminating the need to simulate multiple segments individually. More importantly, the dynamic motion of the leaves could be simulated more faithfully by using the above leaf-position sampling technique in the Monte Carlo simulation	
3502	A general method to perform dose calculations along the axis of symmetrical and asymmetrical photon beams	Algorithms, France, Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage	Many manufacturers of modern linacs provide collimators with jaws that can be set asymmetrically. In the present work, the authors propose the use of a product of four independent output factors related to the four jaws to calculate the reference dose rate of asymmetrical fields. Each of these factors is normalized to the maximum opening of the collimator. A general algorithm for symmetrical and asymmetrical fields is proposed for dose calculation. Calculations have been checked by measurements at the reference depth in a 4-MV x-ray beam

The calculated total production rates of (11)C, (10)C and (15)O nuclei are compared with experimental data and with corresponding results of the FLUKA and POSGEN codes. The distributions of e(+) annihilation points are obtained by simulating radioactive decay of unstable nuclei and transporting positrons in the surrounding medium. A finite spatial resolution of the positron emission tomography (PET) is taken into account in a simplified way. Depth distributions of beta(+)-activity as seen by a PET scanner are calculated and compared to available data for PMMA phantoms. The obtained beta(+)-activity profiles are in good agreement with PET data for proton and (12)C beams at energies suitable for particle therapy. The MCHIT capability to predict the beta(+)-activity and dose distributions in tissue-like materials of different chemical composition is demonstrated

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions	
3422	Characterizing output for dynamic wedges	Air, Biophysics, Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Time, Universities, Water	The output factor for the dynamic wedge, unlike that for the physical wedge, is a complex function of the field dimension along the moving jaw and wedge angle. The large change in output (varying as much as 40% for 45 degrees and 60 degrees wedge angles) can be attributed clearly to the segmented treatment tables (STTs), which specify cumulative monitor unit weighting as a function of jaw position, y. We found that the output factor (in air or water) on the central axis for the dynamic wedge can be characterized by multiplying the output factor (in air or water) for an open field by a normalization factor, which is determined from the STTs, thus indicating that collimator scatter is similar for both the dynamic wedge field and the open field. The introduction of the normalization factor decreases the commissioning time for dynamic wedges significantly and is useful for quality assurance	
3917	Chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by 16.5 MeV protons	Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiation, X-Rays	In a track segment irradiation experiment with 16.5 MeV protons the induction of dicentrics was studied in human T-lymphocytes. The dose-response relationship was linear quadratic with estimated parameters alpha = (0.44 +/- 0.07) x 10(-1) Gy-1 and beta = (1.95 +/- 0.30) x 10(-2) Gy-2. With respect to X-rays a limiting RBE of 1.1-1.2 exists. The present findings are compared with data from other laboratories obtained with 4.9 and 8.7 MeV protons. It was found that the data do not fit theoretical predictions on a proportional relationship between alpha values and LET. Using the microdosimetric quantity yD (25 nm), the dose average of the lineal energy, for characterization of these proton radiations, at a relevant site diameter of 25 nm the ratio of yD = 1.15 is in accordance only with the observed alpha ratio of 1.0 +/- 0.23 for 8.7 and 16.5 MeV protons. In contrast to the prediction of a constant beta at low LET values, the quadratic coefficients increase with increasing LET between 3 and 8 keV/microns

[Review] [16 refs]	Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Choroid Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Choroid Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Choroid Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	Therapy of choroidal metastases depends on several factors, but conventional external beam irradiation using photons is the most common treatment. Proton beam irradiation has recently been used for selected lesions. The advantage of this method is that the dose can be localized to the tumor more accurately. Other therapies include chemotherapy, photocoagulation, or, in extreme cases, enucleation. The author discusses these treatment modalities, complications, and prospects for future therapies.

935	Monte Carlo simulations with time-dependent geometries to investigate effects of organ motion with high temporal resolution	Feasibility Studies, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Massachusetts, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Movement, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time	PURPOSE: To calculate the dose in time-dependent geometry, the results of three-dimensional calculations are usually performed separately and combined. This approach becomes cumbersome when high temporal resolution is required, if the geometry is complex, or if interplay effects between different, independently moving systems are to be studied. The purpose of this project was the implementation of continuous (four-dimensional [4D]) Monte Carlo simulation to study the irradiation of tumors under respiratory motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In taking advantage of object-oriented programming, we implemented 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation. Local dose depositions in the patient are calculated while beam configuration and organ positions are changed continuously. Deformable image registration is used to describe the CT voxel displacement over time. RESULTS: The 4D Monte Carlo technique is applied to a lung cancer case planned for proton therapy. We show that the effect of motion on the dose distribution can be simulated effectively based on statistical motion parameterizations acting on the geometry or based on patient-specific 4D CT information. CONCLUSION: We present a novel method able to calculate dose with underlying time-dependent geometry. The technique allows 4D dose calculation in arbitrary time scales in a single simulation even for double-dynamic systems (e.g., time-dependent beam delivery under organ motion)	
543	Current status and perspectives in alpha radioimmunotherapy. [Review] [72 refs]	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Drug Delivery Systems/td [Trends], Forecasting, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/td [Trends], Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Systemic administration of radiolabeled antibody directed against tumor antigens in radioimmunotherapy (RIT) enables to specifically target the cancer cells and to destroy them. So far, this strategy has proven its efficiency in the treatment of some hematological cancers with antibodies labeled with beta emitting radionuclides. In the last 2 decades, availability of short half life alpha emitters prompted to consider their use in RIT. Contrary to beta particles, alpha particles have a short path length and display a high lineic energy transfer. Those physical characteristics open new fields of clinical applications complementary to beta-RIT. To date, alpha-RIT is still at a preclinical stage of development: the radiolabeling methods need to be optimized to ensure in vivo stability of the radiopharmaceuticals. Some radionuclides have complex decay schemes with daughters emitting further alpha particles whose toxicity needs to be investigated. The modalities of administration of radiolabeled antibodies in animal models require also to be improved for delivering higher doses to tumor targets. A comprehensive analysis of the specific events occurring at cell or tissue level in response to alpha irradiation would be of great interest in order to define the best therapeutic association for residual disease or consolidation treatments. This approach has been proven to be efficient in increasing antitumor response either by using high doses with organ protection (kidney, bone marrow) or by a synergistic effect between alpha-RIT and associated treatments, such as chemotherapy.

For both, a high setup accuracy is required to spare the radiosensitive spinal cord, if a high dose is to be delivered. A phantom study was performed to determine the variation of the dose to the spinal cord surface by predefined setup errors. The measured doses were compared to those calculated by the treatment planning programme. The influence of systematic setup errors on characteristic parameters of the treatment plan quality was quantified. The largest variation of the mean and maximum doses to the spinal cord due to setup errors was significantly larger for carbon ions than for IMRT (mean: 11.9% versus 3.9%, max: 29.2% versus 10.8% of the prescribed dose). For the comparison of measured and calculated doses, mean deviations of 3% (IMRT) and 6% (carbon ions) of the prescribed dose were obtained. These deviations have to be considered, when the spinal cord dose is assessed from the treatment plan and they may also influence the dose prescription. Carbon ions yield better values for coverage (99.9% versus 93.1%) and conformality (110% versus 126%) of the PTV as compared to IMRT, while the spinal cord is better spared. Dose distributions produced with carbon ions, however, are more sensitive to setup errors, which have to be considered during treatment

[Review] [41 refs]	Animals, Coronary Angiography, Coronary Angiography/is [Instrumentation], Europe, France, Humans, Mammography, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Synchrotrons, Synchrotrons/is [Instrumentation], Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], X-Ray Diffraction/is [Instrumentation]	The application of synchrotron radiation in medical research has become a mature field of research at synchrotron facilities worldwide. In the relatively short time that synchrotrons have been available to the scientific community, their characteristic beams of UV and X-ray radiation have been applied to virtually all areas of medical science which use ionizing radiation. The ability to tune intense monochromatic beams over wide energy ranges differentiates these sources from standard clinical and research tools. At the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), a major research facility is operational on an advanced wiggler radiation beamport, ID17. The beamport is designed to carry out a broad range of research ranging from cell radiation biology to in vivo human studies. Medical imaging programs at ID17 include transvenous coronary angiography, computed tomography, mammography and bronchography. In addition, a major research program on microbeam radiation therapy is progressing. This paper will present a very brief overview of the beamline and the imaging and therapy programs.

Radiotherapy dose escalation has been shown to improve local control and survival. However, the toxicities associated with dose escalation are significant and limit the potential of dose escalation. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may have the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio for photon treatment of lung cancer by sparing surrounding normal tissues. However, low-dose exposure to normal lung and organ motion is a major concern. We have conducted several studies to address these issues and started clinical studies to evaluate the potential benefit of IMRT in patients with NSCLC. Proton radiotherapy may have greater potential to spare normal tissue and allow for further dose escalation and acceleration. We are conducting preclinical and clinical studies for imaging-guided proton radiotherapy in NSCLC. In this paper, we discuss the preliminary data, IMRT treatment guidelines, and ongoing studies for proton therapy in NSCLC. [References: 16]

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1066-1070

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In intracranial benign and malignant tumours, it is estimated that between 130 and 180 patients each year are candidates for proton beam therapy. Of these, between 50 and 75 patients have malignant glioma, 30-40 meningeoma, 20-25 arteriovenous malformations, 20-25 skull base tumours and 10-15 pituitary adenoma. In addition, 15 patients with ocular melanoma are candidates. [References: 93]

Analysis of its behavior as a function of depth, field size, and source-surface distance has led to an analytical description with only seven model parameters related to straightforward physical properties. The determination of the characteristic parameter values requires only seven experimentally determined FDDs. The validity of the description has been tested for beam qualities ranging from 60Co gamma rays to 18-MV x rays, using published data from several different sources as well as locally measured data sets. The small number of model parameters is attractive for computer or hand-held calculator applications. The small amount of required measured data is important in view of practical data acquisition for implementation of a computer-based dose calculation system. The generating function allows easy and accurate generation of FDD, tissue-air ratio, tissue-maximum ratio, and tissue-phantom ratio tables

Microdosimetric measurements were made for this neutron beam in a full-scatter water phantom at nine positions inside and outside the useful beam. The lineal energy distribution and the variations of dose-mean, frequency-mean, and saturated lineal energy are compared for these positions. The dose fraction due to gamma rays is also calculated at each of these positions, based upon previously published techniques. A theoretical relative biologic effectiveness, based upon the dual radiation action model of Kellerer and Rossi [Curr. Top. Radiat. Res. 8, 85 (1972)] is also shown for the positions of measurement

Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In a study to evaluate the effect of increasing dose per fraction on radiation response in rectal cancer, two groups of 29 patients each, matched for extent and size of disease, were evaluated. Group A was treated with conventional dose/fraction (180-200 cGy) X 5 days/week and Group B was treated with 250 cGy/fraction X 4 days/week. Total dose was reduced by 10% in Group B patients to allow comparison of biologically equivalent doses. Two categories of patients were analyzed in each group: patients receiving planned high dose preoperative radiation (4000-4500 cGy); and patients receiving high dose radiation for post-surgical recurrent tumors or locally advanced inoperable tumors (5500-6000 cGy). Tumor regression was markedly better in patients treated with the 250 cGy/fraction. Overall response (greater than 50% regression) was 35% (10/29) in Group A and 62% (18/29) in Group B. Nine of 10 patients in Group B, treated preoperatively, had greater than 50% regression in tumor size, with two patients having no evidence of disease on surgico-pathological evaluation. Six of 10 similar patients in Group A had greater than 50% tumor regression

4079	Current management of posterior uveal melanoma. [Review] [34 refs]	Choroid Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Humans, Light Coagulation, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Methods, Optic Nerve, Pennsylvania, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Research, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	The management of malignant melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid (posterior uvea) is controversial. Authorities have disagreed about whether enucleation or conservative treatment offers the best prognosis. Although retrospective studies have suggested that the method of treatment makes no difference in the systemic prognosis, new studies in which the various therapeutic modalities are being compared are currently under way. The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study is attempting to address some of these issues in a randomized clinical trial. In this report, the currently available methods for managing posterior uveal melanoma are reviewed. Small asymptomatic choroidal melanomas can probably be observed periodically until evidence of growth is documented. Some small choroidal melanomas can be treated with laser photocoagulation. Alternatively, radiotherapy (either episcleral application of a radioactive plaque or charged particle irradiation) can be used. Although the two methods of radiotherapy seem equal relative to the development of systemic metastatic lesions, plaque radiotherapy is associated with fewer and less severe local complications. Selected melanomas of the ciliary body and peripheral choroid can be treated by local resection (partial lamellar sclerouvectomy). Local resection has theoretical advantages, but the surgical procedure is associated with potentially greater immediate complications. Enucleation is generally indicated for advanced melanomas that occupy most of the intraocular structures or have caused severe glaucoma. In addition, it is usually recommended for tumors that have invaded the optic nerve. The value of preenucleation radiotherapy in improving patient survival is unproved, although this technique seems reasonable in selected advanced tumors in which enucleation seems inevitable. Orbital exenteration is justified for advanced uveal melanomas with massive extraocular extension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 34]	
1817	Preclinical studies with the photon radiosurgery system (PRS)	Animals, Brachytherapy, Cell Survival, CHO Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Cricetinae, Glioblastoma, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiobiology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Time, Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], X-Rays	PURPOSE: Determine the radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) for low-energy X-rays (average energy of 23 KeV) produced by the Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: RBE values were assessed by comparison with survival data obtained for cells irradiated with either low-energy X-rays from a GE Maxitron 100 machine or high-energy photons from a clinically used Varian 6 MV LINAC. The output of the GE and PRS sources was determined using Baldwin-Farmer and Markus thin window ionization chambers calibrated with 50 kVp X-rays and cross-checked against figures supplied by Photoelectron Corporation. The dose-rate for the PRS was 1.2 Gy/min at a distance of 35 mm with a field flatness of +/-2%. RESULTS: The RBE for the PRS low-energy X-ray source (at 1-mm depth) was greater than either the GE or Varian machines and varied with cell survival. For Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the PRS was 1.25 and 3.3 times more effective than 90 kVp X-rays and 6 MeV photons at 0.5% cell survival, respectively; by comparison, the PRS was 1.2 and 1.9 times more effective at 0.05% cell survival, respectively. Similar RBE values of 1.4 and 1.2 were obtained for human U373 and T98 glioblastoma cells grown in vitro irradiated with the PRS or GE sources, respectively. Other studies showed that the RBE for the PRS low-energy X-ray source increased with depth. The RBEs for the PRS source at 1-mm and 4-mm depth were 1.2 and 2.5 (0.5% survival) and 1. 2 and 1.9 (0.05% survival). CONCLUSIONS: The biological and physical properties of the PRS low-energy X-rays offer, under the right conditions, a significant advantage for patient treatment over conventional external beam, stereotactic, or brachytherapy treatment

The dose-survival response to each radiation was measured at early (1.5 h), mid (3.0 h), and late (4.5 h) times after mitotic selection. In addition the age response was characterized by irradiating cell populations at seven ages between 1.5 and 6.0 h after mitosis with single doses of either radiation. Repair of potentially lethal damage (PLDR) was evaluated in both the dose-survival and age-response experiments by holding irradiated cultures at 37 degrees C for 6 h in PBS or PBS containing 60 microM of the DNA polymerase inhibitor 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (beta-araA) before trypsinization and plating. Delayed plating showed significant PLDR at all ages irradiated with X rays, with up to 10-fold increases of survival depending on the dose and the cell age at irradiation. There was negligible PLDR after neon-ion exposures to early and mid G1-phase cells; only late G1-phase cells repaired neon damage. The beta-araA treatment after X rays reduced the shoulder of the survival curves at all G1 ages studied, and in early and mid G1 reduced survival below the immediately plated control. beta-araA similarly reduced repair of PLD where it was measurable after neon ions. Differences between low- and high-LET radiation damage and repair are discussed	
1949	Comparisons between MCNP, EGS4 and experiment for clinical electron beams	Algorithms, Electrons, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Water, Water/ch [Chemistry]	Understanding the limitations of Monte Carlo codes is essential in order to avoid systematic errors in simulations, and to suggest further improvement of the codes. MCNP and EGS4, Monte Carlo codes commonly used in medical physics, were compared and evaluated against electron depth dose data and experimental backscatter results obtained using clinical radiotherapy beams. Different physical models and algorithms used in the codes give significantly different depth dose curves and electron backscattering factors. The default version of MCNP calculates electron depth dose curves which are too penetrating. The MCNP results agree better with experiment if the ITS-style energy-indexing algorithm is used. EGS4 underpredicts electron backscattering for high-Z materials. The results slightly improve if optimal PRESTA-I parameters are used. MCNP simulates backscattering well even for high-Z materials. To conclude the comparison, a timing study was performed. EGS4 is generally faster than MCNP and use of a large number of scoring voxels dramatically slows down the MCNP calculation. However, use of a large number of geometry voxels in MCNP only slightly affects the speed of the calculation

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes	
2187	Targeted cytoplasmic irradiation with alpha particles induces mutations in mammalian cells	Alpha Particles, Animals, Cell Line, Cell Nucleus/ge [Genetics], Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], Cytoplasm/re [Radiation Effects], Drosophila, Fluorescent Dyes, Free Radicals, Humans, Lung, Mutation, Mutation/re [Radiation Effects], Oxazines, Oxygen, Public Health, Radiation, Radon, Reactive Oxygen Species, Research, United States, Universities, X-Rays	Ever since x-rays were shown to induce mutation in Drosophila more than 70 years ago, prevailing dogma considered the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation, such as mutations and carcinogenesis, as being due mostly to direct damage to the nucleus. Although there was indication that alpha particle traversal through cellular cytoplasm was innocuous, the full impact remained unknown. The availability of the microbeam at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility of Columbia University made it possible to target and irradiate the cytoplasm of individual cells in a highly localized spatial region. By using dual fluorochrome dyes (Hoechst and Nile Red) to locate nucleus and cellular cytoplasm, respectively, thereby avoiding inadvertent traversal of nuclei, we show here that cytoplasmic irradiation is mutagenic at the CD59 (S1) locus of human-hamster hybrid (AL) cells, while inflicting minimal cytotoxicity. The principal class of mutations induced are similar to those of spontaneous origin and are entirely different from those of nuclear irradiation. Furthermore, experiments with radical scavenger and inhibitor of intracellular glutathione indicated that the mutagenicity of cytoplasmic irradiation depends on generation of reactive oxygen species. These findings suggest that cytoplasm is an important target for genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation, particularly radon, the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. In addition, cytoplasmic traversal by alpha particles may be more dangerous than nuclear traversal, because the mutagenicity is accomplished by little or no killing of the target cells

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method	
193	Misrejoining of double-strand breaks after X irradiation: relating moderate to very high doses by a Markov model	Chromosome Aberrations, DNA Damage, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Markov Chains, Models,Statistical, Research, X-Rays	Misrejoining of double-strand breaks (DSBs) detected with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after X irradiation of human cells at very high doses (80-160 Gy) is related to dose-response relationships for chromosome aberrations at moderate doses (1-5 Gy) by the Sax-Markov binary eurejoining/misrejoining (SMBE) model. The SMBE model applies Sax's breakage-and-reunion hypothesis to a subset of DSBs active in binary misrejoining and in binary eurejoining (accidental restitution). The model is numerically consistent with both data on chromosome aberrations and the data obtained by PFGE if proximity effects (restrictions on the range of interactions of DSB free ends) are present. Proximity effects are modeled by partitioning the cell's nucleus into approximately 400 interaction sites, with two active DSB free ends capable of rejoining only if they were produced within the same site. Neglecting one-track action, the SMBE model predicts a quadratic-linear dose-response relationship for DSB misrejoining after exposure to low-LET radiation; i.e., there is a quadratic response at moderate doses which becomes linear as the dose becomes large, rather than vice versa. The linear region results because at very high doses almost all of the active DSB free ends misrejoin rather than eurejoin

The treatment strategy for testicular cancer using chemotherapy has been well established and has been shown to be successful. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy play important roles in multidisciplinary therapy for bladder cancer. Radiotherapy is often used as a radical treatment that is practically equivalent to surgery for prostate cancer. In addition, radiotherapy is useful in cases of bone or brain metastases. In the field of chemotherapy, the development of new agents that would make breakthroughs similar to that of cisplatin is awaited. Taxanes and gemcitabine are good candidates. In the field of radiotherapy, 3D conformal radiation therapy (CRT), which has excellent beam distribution, has recently come into wide use. Moreover, brachytherapy and proton and ion beam therapy are expected to prove useful in prostate cancer therapy. [References: 21]	
2439	The use of an universal wedge for asymmetric fields	Canada, Humans, Jaw, Methylmethacrylate, Methylmethacrylates, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	Beam collimators on newer linear accelerators may be collimated asymmetric to the central axis. The asymmetric beam has a non-flat profile adjusted to yield fields whose half widths are not symmetric about the central axis. While some treatment planning systems modify their programs to mimic the nonuniformity, ideally it is preferred to have a flat profile under the open beam. We have developed a universal wedge that can be used to flatten the field for a variety of jaw sizes and positions and energies for the Varian 2100C. The wedge flattens the field to +/- 3% over 80% of the field

MATERIALS AND METHODS: RDM4 (murine T lymphoma), MOLT-4, TK6 and WTK1 (human lymphoblastoid) cells were irradiated with 12C or 13C. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Cell growth and activities of caspases were determined during the same periods. RESULTS: The ability of carbon ions to induce apoptosis markedly varied according to the cell line. MOLT-4 and TK6 cells underwent apoptosis at 1 Gy within 12 hours post-irradiation, whereas RDM4 and WTK1 showed little apoptosis under the same conditions. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that apoptosis contributes to the overall cytotoxicity of carbon ions towards hematopoietic tumor cells although other death mechanisms must also account for this cytotoxicity	
1302	Micronucleus response of human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cells toward low-LET photon and high-LET p(66)/Be neutron irradiation	Cell Line, Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma/ul [Ultrastructure], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Micronuclei,Chromosome-Defective/re [Radiation Effects], Micronucleus Tests, Neuroblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neuroblastoma/ul [Ultrastructure], Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Tolerance, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Time	The identification of photon resistant tumors that are sensitive to neutrons is still an unresolved problem, and no radiobiological criteria have been developed that could help the selection of patients for neutron therapy. The micronucleus (MN) assay has been evaluated for this purpose in a panel of human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines spanning a wide range of photon sensitivities defined by mean inactivation doses ([Latin capital letter D with macron above][gamma]) of 1.25-3.21 Gy. We show that the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of the p(66)/Be neutrons is significantly correlated with inherent photon sensitivity (r = 0.89, p < 0.01), indicating that the panel of cell lines used is suitable to study the differential biologic response to neutrons and photons. We find that p(66)/Be neutrons are 1.43 to 5.29 times more effective per unit dose in inducing micronuclei than 60Co [gamma]-rays. Surprisingly, cells that are inherently photon resistant tend to show a higher yield of micronuclei following exposure to either photons or neutrons, but no significant correlation could be demonstrated. However, RBE values based on micronucleus yield were found to strongly correlate with RBE values derived from cell survival data (r = 0.91, p < 0.01). It is concluded that although micronucleus yield does not reflect intrinsic sensitivity to either photons or neutrons, the strong correlation between RBE calculated from micronucleus formation and RBE derived from cell survival demonstrates that the micronucleus endpoint has a potential for detecting photon resistant cells that show increased sensitivity to neutrons

The tumour volume was measured as a function of time after irradiation and two experimental endpoints were determined: local tumour control and minimal tumour volume after irradiation. The application of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 2 mg/kg) increased the radiation effect of protons by a factor of 1.4. The same tumour system was used with negative pions. Human tumours are usually irradiated with a mixed radiation produced by the "spot-scan-technique". This radiation quality was simulated in the mouse experiment by two successive irradiations with a spot of densely ionizing peak pions and a spot of sparsely ionizing plateau pions. Application of 2-DG raised the radiation effect due to the sparsely ionizing component again by a factor of 1.4. This indicates that clinical results in radiotherapy might be improved by application of 2-DG during the treatment	
792	Experimental characterization and physical modelling of the dose distribution of scanned proton pencil beams	Calibration, Cobalt, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Scattering,Radiation, Switzerland, Uncertainty, Water	In this paper we present the pencil beam dose model used for treatment planning at the PSI proton gantry, the only system presently applying proton therapy with a beam scanning technique. The scope of the paper is to give a general overview on the various components of the dose model, on the related measurements and on the practical parametrization of the results. The physical model estimates from first physical principles absolute dose normalized to the number of incident protons. The proton beam flux is measured in practice by plane-parallel ionization chambers (ICs) normalized to protons via Faraday-cup measurements. It is therefore possible to predict and deliver absolute dose directly from this model without other means. The dose predicted in this way agrees very well with the results obtained with ICs calibrated in a cobalt beam. Emphasis is given in this paper to the characterization of nuclear interaction effects, which play a significant role in the model and are the major source of uncertainty in the direct estimation of the absolute dose. Nuclear interactions attenuate the primary proton flux, they modify the shape of the depth-dose curve and produce a faint beam halo of secondary dose around the primary proton pencil beam in water. A very simple beam halo model has been developed and used at PSI to eliminate the systematic dependences of the dose observed as a function of the size of the target volume. We show typical results for the relative (using a CCD system) and absolute (using calibrated ICs) dosimetry, routinely applied for the verification of patient plans. With the dose model including the nuclear beam halo we can predict quite precisely the dose directly from treatment planning without renormalization measurements, independently of the dose, shape and size of the dose fields. This applies also to the complex non-homogeneous dose distributions required for the delivery of range-intensity-modulated proton therapy, a novel therapy technique developed at PSI	
1227	Proton beam therapy with high-dose irradiation for superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Esophageal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: With the aim of improving the results of treatment for esophageal carcinoma, we have investigated the efficacy and toxicity associated with the use of a 250-MeV proton beam for radical radiation therapy in esophageal carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas	
4104	A preliminary report on the clinical application of fast neutrons in Krakow	Adult, Aged, Beryllium, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neck, Neutrons, Nuclear Physics, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Poland, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	The neutron therapy facility based on the cyclotron installed in the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow, Poland, is described. Fast neutrons are produced by bombarding a beryllium target with 12.5 MeV deuterons. The unit has been used for treatment of cancer patients by the medical team of the Institute of Oncology in Krakow since September, 1978. Fifty-three patients were treated; most of these patients had advanced head and neck cancer. On the basis of the radiobiological experiments, a standard tumor dose of 1320 radn,gamma in 20 fractions over 4 weeks was established. From among 34 patients with advanced head and neck cancer, treated with neutrons only, and observed for at least one year, 10 patients, (29%) are living free of cancer	
762	Synchrotron radiation-induced formation and reactions of free radicals in human acellular dermal matrix	Calorimetry,Differential Scanning, Diffusion, Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy, Free Radicals/me [Metabolism], Humans, Kinetics, Light, Nitrogen, Research, Skin/cy [Cytology], Skin/me [Metabolism], Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Synchrotrons	The present work characterizes the formation of free radicals in an implantable human acellular dermal tissue (Alloderm, LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) upon irradiation. The tissue was preserved in a vitreous carbohydrate matrix by freeze-drying. Freeze-dried samples were irradiated using a synchrotron light source, and free radicals generated were investigated using the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. At least two free radical populations, with g factors of 1.993 (approximately 43%) and 2.002 (approximately 57%), respectively, were identified in the irradiated tissue. The transformation (reaction) kinetics of free radicals produced was investigated in the presence of nitrogen, oxygen and moisture. The reaction kinetics of free radicals was extremely slow in the nitrogen environment. The presence of oxygen and moisture greatly accelerated free radical reactions in the tissue matrix. The reaction of free radicals could not be described by traditional reaction kinetics. A dispersive kinetics model and a diffusion model were developed to analyze the reaction kinetics in the present study. The dispersive model took into consideration molecular mobility and dispersivity of free radicals in the heterogeneous tissue material. The diffusion model described the radical reaction kinetics as two parallel and simultaneous processes: a first-order fast kinetics mainly on tissue surface and a diffusion-limited slow kinetics in deeper layers of the tissue matrix. Both models described quantitative experimental data well. Further investigation is needed to verify whether any of these two models or concepts describes the inherent radical reaction kinetics in the solid tissue matrix

1908	Development and construction of a neutron beam line for accelerator-based boron neutron capture synovectomy	Animals, Arthritis,Rheumatoid/rt [Radiotherapy], Biophysics, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Equipment Design, Humans, Massachusetts, Monte Carlo Method, Pain, Phantoms,Imaging, Rabbits, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Skin, Synovial Membrane/re [Radiation Effects], Time	A potential application of the 10B(n, alpha)7Li nuclear reaction for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, termed Boron Neutron Capture Synovectomy (BNCS), is under investigation. In an arthritic joint, the synovial lining becomes inflamed and is a source of great pain and discomfort for the afflicted patient. The goal of BNCS is to ablate the synovium, thereby eliminating the symptoms of the arthritis. A BNCS treatment would consist of an intra-articular injection of boron followed by neutron irradiation of the joint. Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations have been used to develop an accelerator-based epithermal neutron beam line for BNCS treatments. The model includes a moderator/reflector assembly, neutron producing target, target cooling system, and arthritic joint phantom. Single and parallel opposed beam irradiations have been modeled for the human knee, human finger, and rabbit knee joints. Additional reflectors, placed to the side and back of the joint, have been added to the model and have been shown to improve treatment times and skin doses by about a factor of 2. Several neutron-producing charged particle reactions have been examined for BNCS, including the 9Be(p,n) reaction at proton energies of 4 and 3.7 MeV, the 9Be(d,n) reaction at deuteron energies of 1.5 and 2.6 MeV, and the 7Li(p,n) reaction at a proton energy of 2.5 MeV. For an accelerator beam current of 1 mA and synovial boron uptake of 1000 ppm, the time to deliver a therapy dose of 10,000 RBEcGy ranges from 3 to 48 min, depending on the treated joint and the neutron producing charged particle reaction. The whole-body effective dose that a human would incur during a knee treatment has been estimated to be 3.6 rem or 0.75 rem, for 1000 ppm or 19,000 ppm synovial boron uptake, respectively, although the shielding configuration has not yet been optimized. The Monte Carlo design process culminated in the construction, installation, and testing of a dedicated BNCS beam line on the high-current tandem electrostatic accelerator at the Laboratory for Accelerator Beam Applications at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology	
751	Proton radiation for treatment of cancer of the oropharynx: early experience at Loma Linda University Medical Center using a concomitant boost technique	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Neoplasm Staging, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To assess accelerated fractionation using photon and proton radiation to improve local control and reduce complications in treating locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer received accelerated photon and proton radiation, 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions/5.5 weeks, to the primary disease, involved lymph nodes, and potential areas of subclinical spread. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial control for local disease was 88%, and for neck node disease, 96%; yielding a 84% locoregional control rate at 5 years. Four patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 84%. The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival rate was 81%; at 5 years, it was 65%. All patients completed the prescribed treatment; though aggressive nutritional and anesthetic support was necessary. Late Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Protons used as a concomitant boost with photons effectively delivered an accelerated time-dose schedule to the cancer with a more tolerable schedule to surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary results reveal increased locoregional control without increased toxicity. Future studies must evaluate the optimum time-dose schedule	
807	The role of nonelastic reactions in absorbed dose distributions from therapeutic proton beams in different medium	Adipose Tissue/re [Radiation Effects], Alpha Particles, Bone and Bones/re [Radiation Effects], Computer Simulation, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Muscles/re [Radiation Effects], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Research, Software, Time, Water	Many new techniques for delivering radiation therapy are being developed for the treatment of cancer. One of these, proton therapy, is becoming increasingly popular because of the precise way in which protons deliver dose to the tumor volume. In order to achieve this level of precision, extensive treatment planning needs to be carried out to determine the optimum beam energies, energy spread (which determines the width of the spread-out Bragg peak), and angles for each patient's treatment. Due to the level of precision required and advancements in computer technology, there is increasing interest in the use of Monte Carlo calculations for treatment planning in proton therapy. However, in order to achieve optimum simulation times, nonelastic nuclear interactions between protons and the target nucleus within the patient's internal structure are often not accounted for or are simulated using less accurate models such as analytical or ray tracing. These interactions produce high LET particles such as neutrons, alpha particles, and recoil protons, which affect the dose distribution and biological effectiveness of the beam. This situation has prompted an investigation of the importance of nonelastic products on depth dose distributions within various materials including water, A-150 tissue equivalent plastic, ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection) muscle, ICRP bone, and ICRP adipose. This investigation was conducted utilizing the GEANT4.5.2 Monte Carlo hadron transport toolkit

Monte Carlo modelling of the linear accelerator and patient geometry was used to explore the effect of removing the flattening filter for various beam qualities and the resultant effect on dose enhancement. In addition, ionization measurements were conducted to observe dose enhancement within a phantom containing CM. Simulation results indicate that for flattened 6-24 MV photon beams and realistic CM tumour concentrations, the dose enhancement remains below 5%. However, if the flattening filter is removed, dose enhancement is increased significantly. For a 30 mg ml(-1) gadolinium CM tumour concentration, for example, 8.4%, 10.8%, 13.7% and 23.1% dose enhancements are achieved for 18 MV, 6 MV, 4 MV and 2 MV unflattened beams, respectively. In contrast to the phototherapy technique, which uses the orthovoltage beam from a modified CT scanner to achieve dose enhancement, all unflattened spectra preserve the dose build-up at the surface, and thus the skin and bone are spared	
3755	A non-docking intraoperative electron beam applicator system	Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Nuclear Medicine, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Universities	A non-docking intraoperative radiation therapy electron beam applicator system for a linear accelerator has been designed to minimize the mechanical, electrical, and tumor visualization problems associated with a docking system. A number of technical innovations have been used in the design of this system. These include: (a) a new intraoperative radiation therapy cone design that gives a better dose uniformity in the treatment volume at all depths; (b) a collimation system which reduces the leakage radiation dose to tissues outside the intraoperative radiation therapy cone; (c) a non-docking system with a translational accuracy of 2 mm and a rotational accuracy of 0.5 degrees; and (d) a rigid clamping system for the cones. A comprehensive set of dosimetric characteristics of the intraoperative radiation therapy applicator system is presented	
2096	Shielding for neutron scattered dose to the fetus in patients treated with 18 MV x-ray beams	Fast Neutrons, Female, Fetal Diseases/et [Etiology], Fetus, Fetus/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Lead, Neutrons, Neutrons/ae [Adverse Effects], Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Particle Accelerators, Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Polyethylene, Pregnancy, Radiation Protection, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Universities, X-Rays/ae [Adverse Effects]	Neutrons are associated with therapeutic high energy x-ray beams as a contaminant that contributes significant unwanted dose to the patient. Measurement of both photon and neutron scattered dose at the position of a fetus from chest irradiation by a large field 18 MV x-ray beam was performed using an ionization chamber and superheated drop detector, respectively. Shielding construction to reduce this scattered dose was investigated using both lead sheet and borated polyethylene slabs. A 7.35 cm lead shield reduced the scattered photon dose by 50% and the scattered neutron dose by 40%. Adding 10 cm of 5% borated polyethylene to this lead shield reduced the scattered neutron dose by a factor of 7.5 from the unshielded value. When the 5% borated polyethylene was replaced by the same thickness of 30% borated polyethylene there was no significant change in the reduction of neutron scatter dose. The most efficient shield studied reduced the neutron scatter dose by a factor of 10. The results indicate that most of the scattered neutrons present at the position of the fetus produced by an 18 MV x-ray beam are of low energy and in the thermal to 0.57 MeV range since lead is almost transparent to neutrons with energies lower than 0.57 MeV. This article constitutes the first report of an effective shield to reduce neutron dose at the fetus when treating a pregnant woman with a high energy x-ray beam	
3461	In vivo diode dosimetry for total marrow irradiation	Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Calibration, Humans, Immobilization, Methods, Multiple Myeloma/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reading, Silicon, Skin, Time, Transplantation Conditioning, Umbilicus	PURPOSE: To describe a method and evaluate the efficacy of using a p-type silicon diode as an alternative to thermoluminescent dosimeters for verifying the accuracy of total marrow irradiation setups and calculations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A calibration factor has been measured for a 6 MV photon beam incident horizontally onto a polystyrene phantom inside an in-house built total marrow irradiation stand. Signal responses due to positioning and orientation of the diode with respect to the source were compared to a 0.6 cc cylindrical ionization chamber inside a polystyrene phantom. Procedures for predicting the diode reading and taking entrance measurements have been developed and action levels established to determine causes for discrepancies when ratios between predicted and actual values fell outside a +/- 5% tolerance range. Measurements were taken at the skin surface over the umbilicus calculation point for alternating 1.5 Gy anterior and posterior fractions given bidaily over a 3-day period. RESULTS: A total of 137 measurements taken from January to September 1994 for 23 patients were analyzed using a frequency histogram. The histogram indicated a mean reading of 1.002 +/- 2.6, and that three of the measurements fell outside the 5% tolerance. Investigation into the cause of the discrepancies showed that the diode had been improperly placed one time and that further patient immobilization needs to be considered. CONCLUSION: It is possible to use a diode as an in vivo dosimeter for a total marrow irradiation technique. The ease of implementation and immediate readouts make a diode system preferable to a thermoluminescent system for identifying systematic errors and verifying treatment configurations and monitor unit calculations	
2737	Backscatter into the beam monitor chamber: implications for dosimetry of asymmetric collimators	Canada, Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation	Backscatter from the asymmetric collimators of a linac into the beam monitor chamber (BMC) has been investigated for two accelerators having different BMC configurations. The effect has been quantified as a function of field size and collimator jaw position for 6 and 18 MV beams. The results indicate a maximum 2.5% (6 MV) and 4% (18 MV) decrease in output in one case and a negligible effect in the other case. The experiments indicate that the difference can be attributed to the different construction of the BMC's for the two accelerators	
3831	Physics for radiosurgery with linear accelerators. [Review] [38 refs]	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Canada, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Scattering,Radiation, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Universities	Radiosurgery had a long development period and, for more than three decades, was used only in a few specialized centers around the world. The development of LINAC-based radiosurgical techniques combined with the concurrent advances in imaging modalities during the 1980s, however, caused so much interest in this treatment modality that most major radiotherapy centers now offer this service or at least plan to offer it in the near future. When considering a LINAC for radiosurgical use, one should remember that technical and clinical requirements for accurate radiosurgery are far more stringent than those applied to standard radiotherapy. This is because in radiosurgery, the targeted volumes are much smaller and the dose is usually delivered in a single irradiation session, whereas in radiotherapy, the dose is delivered to a relatively large target volume on a fractionated basis. Linear accelerator-based radiosurgery broadens the scope of radiotherapy departments. The impetus to introduce this service at a medical center usually comes from neurosurgeons, however. Even after the service becomes routine at an institution, it is the neurosurgeon who refers the patient and who plays the most important role in determining the target volume and its location within the brain. The decision on the choice of isodose surface and the prescribed dose, however, belongs to the radiotherapist. It is becoming clear that radiosurgery is a complex treatment modality for which a successful outcome requires a collaborative team effort by several hospital-based professionals, including neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, neuroradiologists, and medical physicists. As in standard radiotherapy, physics plays an important role in radiosurgery, not only in the development of target localization, treatment-planning, and dose delivery techniques, but also in the actual patient contact, from the diagnostic target localization procedures, through treatment planning, to patient preparation on the device and dose delivery.

3604	Induction and repair of DNA strand breaks and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-detectable sites in 40-75 kVp X-irradiated compared to 60Co gamma-irradiated human cell lines	Canada, Cell Line, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cytarabine/pd [Pharmacology], DNA, DNA Damage, DNA Polymerase II/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors], DNA Repair, DNA,Single-Stranded/de [Drug Effects], DNA,Single-Stranded/re [Radiation Effects], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Humans, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time, X-Rays	We have compared the initial yield and subsequent enzymatic repair of DNA strand breaks and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC)-detectable sites in cultured human cell lines after irradiation with soft (40-75 kVp) X rays and hard (60Co) gamma rays, two forms of low-LET radiation whose average ionization densities differ by 15-fold (i.e., approximately 4.5 keV/mu and approximately 0.3 keV/mu, respectively). Incubation of X- or gamma-irradiated cell cultures in the presence of araC resulted in the accumulation of DNA single-strand interruptions, as measured by conventional velocity sedimentation analysis in alkaline sucrose gradients. Since the drug is a selective inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, this observation implicates polymerase alpha in the repair of radiogenic damage. Specifically, DNA repair analysis in X-ray-treated cells suggested that polymerase alpha is a key participant in the repair of a distinct, albeit structurally undefined, class of radioproducts [presumably a combination of double-strand breaks and alkali-stable lesions (e.g., modified base/sugar residues and DNA crosslinks)], but takes little, if any, part in the restitution of single-strand breaks (whether frank scissions or alkali-labile bonds) induced by ionizing radiation. Accordingly, the drug did not significantly inhibit the repair of DNA damage in cultures exposed to less than or equal to 100 Gy of gamma radiation. A remarkable difference was evident with respect to the absolute yields of these two major classes of DNA injury--that is, araC-detectable sites and single-strand breaks--depending on the type of radiation administered. For the same dose, the level of araC-detectable sites found in cells treated with gamma rays (less than or equal to 150 Gy) was as much as 3.4 times lower than that observed in X-ray-exposed cells (i.e., one site per 1,155 and 335 eV, respectively). In contrast, the number of strand breaks induced by gamma rays was approximately 2.3-fold higher than that produced by X rays (one break per 27 and 61 eV, respectively). Assuming that, among other conditions, the relative biological effectiveness of the comparatively densely ionizing soft X rays is roughly twice that of the sparsely ionizing hard gamma rays, our data strongly imply that those radioproducts which are manifested as araC-detectable sites may be approximately 45 times more deleterious, on a per lesion basis, than those observed as single-strand breaks	
8	Proton irradiation of malignant uveal melanoma. A five year follow-up of patients treated in Uppsala, Sweden	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty patients with malignant uveal melanoma were treated at the The Svedbergh cyclotron in Uppsala from 1989 to 1991. Each tumour received a total dose of 54.6 Gy in four equal fractions on four following days. After treatment the melanoma in all eyes showed decrease in size combined with irradiation retinopathy. In eight patients the treatment was successful after five years. Nine eyes had to be enucleated, two due to recurrence and seven due to neovascular glaucoma. Three patients died, two from metastases and one from heart disease. In all patients the visual acuity was dependent on the distance between the irradiation field and the macula or optic nerve. Each patient suffered from transient post irradiation skin erythema and permanent loss of eyelashes and eyebrows when these were included in the irradiation field. The development of secondary glaucoma was positively correlated with tumour volume, but not to the age or sex of the patients. Histological examination of all the enucleated eyes revealed residual viable tumour without obvious radiation damage: mitotic figures were not identified. MRI examination, performed before and after treatment, demonstrated a marked shift in water binding properties after irradiation. The final visual acuity was dependent on the location of the tumour	
226	Comparison of 4 MV photon surface dose among Varian, Siemens, and Elekta linear accelerators for tangential breast treatment: a phantom study	Breast, Breast Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Water	PURPOSE: We have compared the differences in a 4-MV photon surface dose among Varian, Siemens, and Elekta linear accelerators (linacs) with wedges for tangential breast treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The wedge factor and the surface dose were measured using a solid water phantom and an ion chamber for each linear accelerator with various field sizes and wedge angles. A tangential treatment plan was applied to an elliptical hollow cylinder water phantom with a radiochromic film placed thereon. A dose was delivered to a simulated target in the phantom, and the resulting dose distribution was analyzed using a film scanner. RESULTS: Varian's wedges resulted in the highest wedge factors, ranging from 0.37 to 0.75 depending on the wedge angles. Varian's wedges led to the highest normalized skin doses, ranging between 0.40 and 0.73 depending on the wedge angles and field sizes. In the cylinder phantom test with two tangential beams, the Varian linac provided a nearly 20% higher maximum dose than the Siemens and Elekta linacs. CONCLUSION: The Varian linac resulted in the highest surface doses, and the Elekta linac led to the lowest for nearly all the measurement conditions we employed, including open beams

1875	An Australasian assessment of the basic treatment equivalent model derived from New South Wales data.[see comment]	Australia, Calibration, Data Collection, Diagnosis-Related Groups, Humans, Models,Biological, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], New South Wales, New Zealand, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, Time	The current method of assessment of radiation oncology linear accelerator throughput is either by patients per unit time or fields per unit time. This, however, does not take into consideration the complexity of different treatment techniques or of casemix. A model has been developed in an earlier study, called 'basic treatment equivalent' (BTE), to measure patient throughput of a linear accelerator, which includes consideration of the complexity of treatment techniques. The present study compared the BTE model with the current best measure of patient throughput of fields per hour. All 37 departments in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in testing the model, and 36 agreed to participate. The study period for each department was a consecutive 4 weeks between August and December, 1996. The prospective data collected were the total BTE units treated per linear accelerator per day, the total number of patients and fields treated per linear accelerator per day, and the total linear accelerator hours of operation per day excluding calibration time and significant breaks of linear accelerator time such as planned meal breaks. The treatment breaks between consecutive treatment fractions were not excluded from the linear accelerator treatment time. The throughput data for 36 departments (92 linear accelerators) were collected over the 4-week study period. The average throughput for the departments was 10.8 fields per hour and 4.2 patients per hour. The average BTE per department was 5.7 BTE per hour. The average BTE per episode per department was 1.38. The BTE model was found to be a more sensitive measure of productivity compared with fields per hour (P < 0.001). Some treatment techniques were thought to be not well represented by the BTE formula, particularly those techniques where junctions were present. The BTE model is a more sensitive measure than fields per hour and better reflects the variations in complexity in techniques. Despite this result there is further refinement to be performed to make the model even more sensitive

The confining action of a longitudinal magnetic field was calculated by means of Monte Carlo simulation, where scattering and motion in the magnetic field were treated simultaneously. Appreciable compression of the beam could only be achieved using fields of the order at least 50 T, much beyond the realm of practical feasibility

[Review] [40 refs]	Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Child, Child,Preschool, Cushing Syndrome/di [Diagnosis], Cushing Syndrome/ep [Epidemiology], Cushing Syndrome/pp [Physiopathology], Cushing Syndrome/th [Therapy], Humans, Hydrocortisone/se [Secretion], Infant, Pituitary Irradiation, Recurrence, Syndrome	As with adults, the diagnosis of Cushing's disease in childhood can be difficult. The clinical presentation in children is distinctive in terms of the effects on growth and pubertal development. The biochemical diagnosis can usually be made with standard dexamethasone suppression testing, similar to such testing in adults. The clinical course of Cushing's disease in children tends to be more aggressive than in adults, as evidenced by higher rates of Nelson's syndrome after bilateral adrenalectomy and higher rates of recurrence after removal of corticotrope adenomas. TSS is well tolerated in children and has fewer side effects than other modalities. Currently, pituitary irradiation is best reserved as adjunctive therapy. Newer stereotactic computer assisted linear accelerator techniques (e.g., proton knife) may provide increased effectiveness with fewer side effects and be particularly useful in childhood Cushing's disease. Appropriate treatment of children with Cushing's disease can be compatible with satisfactory psychosocial adjustment and fertility in adulthood. [References: 40]

The MCNP code was used to study the dependence of these neutron fluences on room design, room area and the effect of neutron moderator materials placed on the room walls. The results of the investigation showed a poor agreement between the simulations and empirical approximations, suggesting that the formulae found in the literature can underestimate the neutron flux inside a radiotherapy room

The model describes initiation (formation of translocations) and promotion (clonal expansion and loss of contact inhibition of initiated cells). Additional terms either in the initiation model or in the rate of clonal expansion of initiated cells, describe detrimental bystander effects for chromosome aberrations as reported in the scientific literature. In the present study, the SVM with bystander effects is tested on a suitable dataset. In addition to the simulation of non-linear effects, a classical dataset for neoplastic transformation in C3H 10T1/2 cells after alpha particle irradiation is used to show that the model without bystander features can also describe LNT-like dose responses. A published model for bystander induced neoplastic transformation was adapted for chromosome aberration induction and used to compare the results obtained with the different models

Synchrotron Radiation sources open new perspectives. This has already been the case for a number of years in molecular and cellular biology where the scope of absorption and diffraction work has been greatly extended. This could also be the case for medical imaging and radiotherapy where the characteristics of the beam (collimation, stability, flux) allow new approaches in the energy range of radiological X-rays, namely between 30 keV and 100 keV. Such a source exists today in Grenoble, with the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The opening of a beamline dedicated to medical research for whole European scientific community is planned for the end of 1996. This beamline, coupled with the "microbeam" beamlines, will cover medical imaging (angiography, tomodensitometry, microtomography, X-ray microscopy) as well as radiotherapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rhesus monkeys treated with TBI photon doses up to 8.5 Gy and proton doses up to 7.5 Gy were studied at intervals up to 25 years post-irradiation. They were compared with control groups with a similar age distribution. Cataract formation and ocular fundus lesions were scored according to a standardized protocol. Fluorescein angiography and histopathology was performed in selected animals. RESULTS: Cataract formation occurred after a latent period of 3-5 years. Significant cataract induction was observed for photon-doses of 8 and 8.5 Gy and beyond 20 years after proton irradiation. The severity of the lesions represents significant impairment of vision and would require cataract surgery if similar results occurred in human bone marrow transplant patients. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a normal pattern of retinal vessels in 13 out of 14 animals (93%) from the irradiated group and in eight out of nine animals (89%) from the control group. No additional lesions apart from age-related degenerative changes could be demonstrated. Histological evaluation revealed no radiation-associated vasculopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation alone for doses up to 8.5 Gy of photons does not carry a potential risk for fundus pathology, whereas clinically important cataract induction should be anticipated within 5 years after photon doses of 8.0 and 8.5 Gy and proton doses in excess of 2.5 Gy

On the basis of these PET images the quality of the irradiation, i.e. the position of the field, the particle range in vivo and even local deviations between the planned and the applied dose distribution, can be evaluated. However, for such an evaluation the measured beta+-activity distributions have to be compared with those predicted from the treatment plan. The predictions are calculated as follows: a Monte Carlo event generator produces list mode data files of the same format as the PET scanner in order to be processed like the measured ones for tomographic reconstruction. The event generator models the whole chain from the interaction of the projectiles with the target, i.e. their stopping and nuclear reactions, the production and the decay of positron emitters, the motion of the positrons as well as the propagation and the detection of the annihilation photons. The steps of the modelling, the experimental validation and clinical implementation are presented

Calculations using SHIELD-HIT have been performed for 1H, 12C and 26Fe ions with energies up to 1000 MeV/u transported through water, soft tissue and aluminium. These have been validated by comparing Monte Carlo results with experimental data and results from other Monte Carlo codes for ion transport. Good agreement has been found for depth-dose distributions of protons and 12C ions in water up to depths well beyond the Bragg peak, where nuclear fragmentation effects dominate and for the production of secondary particles at different depths. Detailed track-length fluence spectra of secondary particles have been calculated for various combinations of projectiles and targets of interest for space radiation and radiotherapy applications. The secondary particle spectra in water from carbon ions have been used for calculations of stopping-power ratios for ionization chamber dosimetry, confirming the values recommended by the IAEA Code of Practice for radiotherapy dosimetry with heavy ions	
1202	Patient setup and verification for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time	Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is now widely used in the radiation therapy community. The ability of IMRT to deliver complex dose distributions has allowed dose escalation to targets while sparing normal tissues. In IMRT the roles of the physicist, dosimetrist, and physician are changed. Inverse planning, which is inherent to IMRT, requires that the final dose solution be defined at the beginning of the planning process. The physician must define specific dose volume constraints for the target as well as normal tissues. The physicist and dosimetrist must evaluate the final plan and determine if it meets the goals of the treatment, even if it does not completely satisfy the initial constraints. Once a plan is decided upon, the ability of the clinic to safely and accurately deliver that plan to the patient must be confirmed. As with any new technology, IMRT has created a need for new quality assurance procedures. Here we describe our IMRT process from simulation through planning and treatment. By standardizing our simulations we have decreased setup times and decreased the threat of collisions. Comparison of pseudo-DRR's and multiple-exposure port films allows confirmation of patient positioning on the linac. Our treatment delivery quality assurance program using film and MOSFET detectors in a polystyrene phantom is also described. We provide insight on how to overcome some of the common problems encountered in treatment planning and delivery such as isocenter location, collision avoidance, table indexing, dose confirmation, and plan analysis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with meningioma of the skull base or spine were irradiated with helium charged particle radiotherapy at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (UCLBL) during the period 1981-1992. Twenty-six patients were treated for intracranial and three for spinal tumors. Total doses of 53.0-80.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) with a mean of 63 GyE were delivered using the helium ion beam. RESULTS: Ten-year local control and survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method were 84% and 80% respectively. Doses of 60.0 GyE were delivered with a low rate of complications. The only failures were in massive, recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: High doses using helium charged particle radiotherapy can be safely and effectively delivered to large residual or unresectable meningioma near radiosensitive structures

The data were collected in 1984-1985 by the Patterns of Care Study Survey of Palliative Care conducted in 49 institutions selected to provide valid national averages for the practice patterns reported. Data were collected from 784 patient records selected from five "strata" of practice. Demographic data and process data were tabulated and national averages were calculated from the data. Four metastatic sites were selected, weight bearing bones (401), non-weight bearing bones (102), brain metastasis (224), and lung-mediastinum (57). The median patient age was 63 years, equally divided by sex. In 52% of patients this was the first metastasis. Common Karnofsky performance scores ranged from 40 to 80%. Lung, breast, and prostate were the most common primaries. Two-thirds of the patients were treated by linear accelerators, one-third by cobalt. The median number of fractions was 10, median dose 3000 cGy, median fraction size 300 cGy, and median treatment duration 15 days. The goal of treatment was relief of pain (98%) and return of function (30%) for weight bearing bones, for brain metastasis it was preservation of function (68%), pain relief (33%), and relief of compression (25%). All sites showed TDF values that ranged from 33-85, and a TDF of approximately 65 was most common for weight bearing bones and brain metastasis with no consistent pattern of TDF selection for the other sites. Compliance by strata of practice with work-up criteria was excellent with isolated poor compliance seen in several strata

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis

A priority is reduction of late effects which include chronic chest wall or breast pain, poor cosmesis, and cardiac toxicity. As breast screening detects early cancers we may be able to safely restrict irradiation postlumpectomy to the tumour bed with a margin, defining a 'partial breast' target volume for treatment. Differing technical approaches to partial breast irradiation are being evaluated in phase III studies with standard whole breast irradiation. These include intra-operative single doses, hypo-fractionated accelerated brachytherapy, and LINAC (linear accelerator)-based three-dimensional external beam therapy. [References: 14]

As of 9/92 a total of 28 patients suffering from peripheral (n = 20) or centrally (n = 8) located soft tissue sarcomas had been were treated. Thirteen patients revealed a primary and 15 patients a recurrent tumor. Tumor resection with negative margins was performed in 20 patients, positive margins remained in 5 patients, and gross macroscopic residual disease in 3 patients. Combined intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy was applied in 22 patients, using IORT doses of 10-20 Gy and an external beam dose of 26-50 Gy. Three patients were irradiated intraoperatively twice with a time interval of 24 h. After a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 20 patients are disease free. Two patients died 4 and 5 months after the end of therapy with rapidly progressive distant metastases. An infield failure within the external beam target volume was seen in 1 patient and local failure at the field margin of the external field in 3 patients. So far, there have been no IORT infield failures. Follow-up is performed with magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 patients a second operation was necessary because of a severe wound infection, including one patient suffering from osteomyelitis of a neighboring bone. Mild sensory neuropathy occurred in 1 patient 7 months after treatment. Overall only mild and reversible postoperative and posttherapeutic complications were seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

All patients had received curative pelvic irradiation (greater than or equal to 1750 reu) nine to 133 months prior to the investigation. Eleven patients had recurrent or persistent disease and four (36%) of these patients had severe hematuria. The urinary morbidity of the 37 patients without evidence of disease varied between 24 and 38%, but only 3 to 8% of these patients experienced severe disturbances. Four patients (9%) had to undergo bowl resection due to severe radiation damage in the intestines. In conclusion, slight morbidity after curative radiation treatment is to be expected in about 30% of patients surviving more than six months. Severe complications may be expected in 10% of the patients. Serious complaints from the urologic tract, especially hematuria, indicate recurrent or persistent disease rather than a late radiation effect	
1507	Conformal radiotherapy optimization with micromultileaf collimators: comparison with radiosurgery techniques	Algorithms, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, France, Humans, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Temperature	PURPOSE: Conformal radiotherapy (CRT) consists of irradiating the target volume while avoiding the healthy peripheral tissues and organs at risk as far as possible. One technique used to treat intracranial tumors consists of using micromultileaf collimators (MMLCs). Given the dose constraints involved, it is of interest to optimize MMLC irradiation parameters and compare the results of this technique with those of conventional radiosurgery (RT) techniques (Gamma Knife and linear accelerator stereotactic RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: MMLC protocols are optimized in two stages. The orientation of the fields, delimited by a beam's eye view technique, is determined using a genetic algorithm method. The weighting of the fields and subfields when using intensity modulation and the position of the leaves are optimized using a simulated annealing method. We compared the results obtained for 8 clinical cases using 5 intensity-modulated fields with those obtained using the two radiosurgery techniques. The comparison indexes are those defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated the advantages of using intensity modulation and the improvement obtained for the RTOG indexes in the case of CRT with MMLC, although the healthy peripheral tissues were less exposed to radiation with the radiosurgery techniques. The results also highlight the difficulty encountered with radiosurgery techniques in obtaining satisfactory dose homogeneity when the protocol is defined with numerous iosocenters. CONCLUSION: In CRT with MMLC, intensity modulation makes it possible to reduce the number of fields used. It is especially useful to optimize the orientations in the case of target volumes of complex shape or when volumes at risk are in the vicinity of the target. If used correctly, MMLC can be a valuable alternative to conventional radiosurgery techniques	
490	Using fluence separation to account for energy spectra dependence in computing dosimetric a-Si EPID images for IMRT fields	Algorithms, Calibration, Equipment Design, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Research, Spectrophotometry/mt [Methods]	This study develops a method to improve the dosimetric accuracy of computed images for an amorphous silicon flat-panel imager. Radially dependent kernels derived from Monte Carlo simulations are convolved with the treatment-planning system's energy fluence. Multileaf collimator (MLC) beam hardening is accounted for by having separate kernels for open and blocked portions of MLC fields. Field-size-dependent output factors are used to account for the field-size dependence of scatter within the imager. Gamma analysis was used to evaluate open and sliding window test fields and intensity modulated patient fields. For each tested field, at least 99.6% of the points had gamma < 1 with a 3%, 3-mm criteria. With a 2%, 2-mm criteria, between 81% and 100% of points had gamma < 1. Patient intensity modulated test fields had 94%-100% of the points with gamma < 1 with a 2%, 2-mm criteria for all six fields tested. This study demonstrates that including the dependencies of kernel and fluence on radius and beam hardening in the convolution improves its accuracy compared with the use of radial and beam-hardening independent kernels; it also demonstrates that the resultant accuracy of the convolution method is sufficient for pretreatment, intensity modulated patient field verification	
432	CyberKnife radiosurgery for spinal neoplasms. [Review] [38 refs]	Gold, Humans, Immobilization, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Robotics, Spinal Neoplasms, Spinal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. Its use for the treatment of spinal lesions has been limited by the availability of effective target immobilization and localization technologies. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large doses of radiation near radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. The CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) is an imageguided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery system that allows for the radiosurgical treatment of spinal lesions. The system utilizes the coupling of an orthogonal pair of X-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted lightweight linear accelerator which has 6 d.f. that guides the therapy beam to the intended target without the use of frame-based fixation. Realtime imaging tracking allows for patient movement tracking with 1mm spatial accuracy. Cervical spine lesions are located and tracked relative to skull bony landmarks; lower spinal lesions are tracked relative to percutaneously placed gold fiducial bone markers. Spinal stereotactic radiosurgery using a frameless image-guided system is now both feasible and safe. The major potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of spinal lesions are short treatment time in an outpatient setting with rapid recovery and good symptomatic response. This technique offers a successful therapeutic modality for the treatment of a variety of spinal lesions as a primary treatment or for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques, in medically inoperable patients, lesions located in previously irradiated sites, or as an adjunct to surgery.

Despite surgical exploration and an extensive diagnostic workup including radiological, nuclear medicine, and computer-assisted tomographic studies, many patients proved to have occult liver metastases manifested within 9 months post treatment. In addition, local and regional control of the primary neoplasm (approximately 20%) has been difficult to obtain even with doses of 6000 equivalent rad in 7 1/2 weeks. Gastric and biliary obstruction have required surgical bypass procedures since irradiation has not been successful in relieving obstructive symptoms. Evidence of gastrointestinal injury has been present in postradiation therapy in approximately 10% of patients, a figure which might be higher if more patients had a longer survival (average 10 months). Some patients require pancreatic enzyme supplementation because of pancreatic deficiency either secondary to tumor or treatment. Further improvement in local control and survival requires better diagnostic methods for evaluation of local and metastatic spread, improved therapy for local and regional disease, as well as therapy directed at occult liver metastases that are frequently present	
1055	The potential application of beta-delayed particle decay beam 9C in cancer therapy	Beta Rays/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Cell Line, Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer/ph [Physiology], Models,Biological, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physics, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Water, Water/ch [Chemistry]	A radioactive ion beam like 9C serves as a double radiation source and may be useful in cancer treatment, where the essential irradiation comes from the external beam itself and the extra one is due to the low-energy particles emitted internally during the decay of 9C. Based on the microdosimetric specific energy spectrum in cell nuclei, a model to evaluate the biological effect induced by the internally emitted particles from a beta-delayed particle decay beam has been developed. In this paper, using this model the additional contributions to the cell-killing effect due to the emitted particles from stopping 9C ions were incorporated in the design of spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBP) for radioactive 9C beams. For this purpose, a simulated annealing algorithm was employed to optimize the superposing weighting fractions of all monoenergetic beams so that a uniform cell survival level could be realized across the SOBP within an acceptable deviation of 5%. SOBPs with different widths and at different cell survival levels were designed for both therapeutic 9C and 12C beams for comparison. The potential use of the 9C beam in radiotherapy compared to the 12C beam, which is commonly adopted in the practices of current heavy-ion therapy, is shown systematically in terms of the distributions of biological effective dose and cell survival along the beam penetration	
4413	The relative cellular radiosensitivity of 30 human in vitro cell lines of different histological type to high LET 62.5 MeV (p-->Be+) fast neutrons and 4 MeV photons	Cell Line, Energy Transfer, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Neutrons, Photons, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Universities	It has been suggested that fast neutron therapy may have a role in the treatment of those tumours which lie within the most photon-resistant histological categories. A clinical radiobiological study by Battermann et al., however, did not support this hypothesis (Battermann, J.J. et al., Eur. J. Cancer 17: 539-548, 1981). Similarly, in a comparison of the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity of 20 human in vitro cell lines with 4 MeV photons and 62.5 MeV (p-->Be+) neutrons, there was no correlation between RBE and photon sensitivity. However, because the range of histological cell types in this in vitro study did not include sufficient representatives of the most sensitive and resistant histological categories, it was not possible to examine the relationship between histology and the relative efficacy of fast neutrons compared with photons. The intrinsic radiosensitivity of a further 10 human in vitro cell lines has thus been measured and the results of all 30 cell lines used in a comparison of the relationship between relative neutron sensitivity and histology. These results together with those obtained by reanalysis of published data from a clinical study of the RBE of pulmonary metastases by Battermann et al. suggest that in the clinical situation, photon-resistant histology per se may not be a sufficient criterion for the choice of high LET irradiation and emphasize the need for predictive assays for individual tumours	
2225	Polarity effect for various ionization chambers with multiple irradiation conditions in electron beams.[see comment]	Electricity, Electrons, France, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Reading	The effect of reversing the voltage polarity applied to an ionization chamber has been investigated in electron beams for several types of chambers and several irradiation conditions. It has been found that differences in readings can be significant for cylindrical chambers (about 10%) as well as for plane parallel chambers (20%). The effect is larger for large field sizes than small ones. It generally includes an appreciable stem and cable effect. Differences in readings with both polarities are related to the energy distribution of the electron beam and are greater for lower electron energies than higher. Polarity effect and charge deposit within the chamber wall material appear to be closely connected. This charge deposit, expressed as a proportion of the total collected charge, can be directly derived from double polarities measurements. Careful investigation of the effect should be made to avoid significant error (over 5%) in the determination of the absorbed dose

[German]	Female, Humans, Male, Mortality, Particle Accelerators, Proctitis/et [Etiology], Prostate, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Sexual Dysfunction,Physiological/et [Etiology], Urethral Stricture/et [Etiology], Urination Disorders/et [Etiology]	The side effects of primary percutaneous radiotherapy in 100 patients with prostatic cancer were evaluated and classified into different degrees of gravity. It was shown that especially chronic side effects are benign in most of all cases. Severe - but not vitally dangerous - complications in bladder and intestine are rare (3%); their percentage corresponds roughly to the average mortality rate of surgical intervention (radical prostatectomy). Contrary to operation, troubles of the sexual function appear only in one third of the patients. Taking into consideration the similar therapeutic results of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, radiotherapy is more favorable with respect to side effects. This essential aspect should be considered when making a decision whether to apply a surgical or a radiotherapeutic treatment treatment

Better shielding of critical organs is obtained by using their particular ballistic (Bragg peak and lateral narrow penumbra). Some indications as ocular melanoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull are now strongly accepted by the radiation oncologist community. Others are still in evaluation: meningioma, locally advanced nasopharynx tumor and paediatric tumors. The aim of this review is to present the clinical results of a technic which seems "confidential" because of the rarety and the cost of equipments. [References: 105]	
4601	Radiation response of primary human skin fibroblasts and their bystander cells after exposure to counted particles at low and high LET	Alpha Particles, Bystander Effect, Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cells,Cultured, Diffusion, DNA Repair, Energy Transfer, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Methods, Protons, Radiation, Research, Skin, Survival	PURPOSE: To investigate the dependence of bystander effects on linear energy transfer (LET) in the low dose region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The single-ion microbeam of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) was used to irradiate confluent primary human skin fibroblasts. Cells plated on a special irradiation dish were targeted with 10 MeV protons (LET 4.7 keV/microm) and 4.5 MeV a-particles (LET 100 keV/microm). During exposure, the cells were confluent allowing signal transfers through both gap junctions and diffusion. RESULTS: For 10 MeV protons the clonogenic capability was significantly higher after exposure to 70 protons (0.31 Gy) compared with unirradiated cells. For higher doses the survival curve was exponential. Exposure of only 10% of all nuclei resulted in a similar radiation response in the low dose region. For higher doses up to 2.2 Gy no cell killing was observed. For 4.5 MeV alpha-particles an exponential survival curve was obtained. Irradiation of only 10% of all cell nuclei resulted in an survival curve as had been expected in the absence of any bystander effect. CONCLUSION: The type and extent of bystander effects turned out to be dependent on the particles' LET and are likely to depend also on the cell line used and the techniques applied

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer	
1189	An integrated treatment delivery system for CSRS and CSRT and clinical applications	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/sc [Secondary], Head, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lymphoma,Large B-Cell,Diffuse/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Texas, Time	An integrated treatment delivery system for conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (CSRS) and radiotherapy (CSRT) has been developed through a collaboration involving Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., Tyco/Radionics, Inc., and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The system consists of a 6-MV linear accelerator (LINAC) equipped with a Tyco/Radionics miniature multileaf collimator (mMLC). For the conventional SRS treatment, the circular collimator housing can be attached to the opening window of the mMLC. The treatment delivery system is integrated with a radiotherapy treatment planning system and a record-and-verify system. The purpose of this study is to report the characteristics, performance, benefits, and the clinical applications of this delivery system. The technical specifications of the LINAC and mMLC were tested, and all the specifications were met. The 80% to 20% penumbral width for each mMLC leaf is approximately 3 mm and is nearly independent of the off-axis positions of a leaf. The maximum interleaf leakage is 1.4% (1.1% on average) and the maximum intra-leaf leakage is 1.0% (0.9% on average). The leaf position precision is better than 0.5 mm for all the leaves. The integration of the SRS/SRT treatment planning system, mMLC, and LINAC has been evaluated successfully for transferring the patient treatment data file through radiotherapy treatment planning system to the patient information and treatment record-and-verify server and the mMLC controller. Subsequently, the auto-sequential treatment delivery for SRS, CSRS/CSRT, and the step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy has also been tested successfully. The accuracy of dose delivery was evaluated for a 2-cm spherical target in a Radiological Physics Center SRS head phantom with GAFChromic films and TLD. Five non-coplanar arcs, using a 2-cm diameter circular collimator, were used for this simulation treatment. The accuracy to aim the center of the spherical target was within 0.5 mm and the deviation of dose delivery to the isocenter of the target was within 2% of the calculated dose. For the irregularly shaped tumor, a tissue-equivalent head phantom was used to evaluate the accuracy of dose delivery for using either geometric conformal treatment or IMRT. The accuracy of dose delivery to the isocenter was within 2% and 3% of the calculated dose, respectively. From October 26, 1999 to September 30, 2002, we treated over 400 SRS patients and 70 SRT patients. Four representative cases are presented to illustrate the capabilities of this dedicated unit in performing conventional SRS, CSRS, and CSRT. For all the cases, the geometric conformal-plan dose distributions showed a high degree of conformity to the target shape. The degree of conformity can be evaluated using the target-volume-ratio (TVR). Our preferred TVR values for highly conformed dose distributions range from 1.6 to 2.0. The patient setup reproducibility for the Gill-Thomas-Cosman (GTC) noninvasive head frame ranges from 0.5 to 1 mm, and the head and neck noninvasive frame is within 2 mm. The integrated treatment delivery system offers excellent conformation for complicated planning target volumes with the stereotactic setup approach, ensuring that dose delivery can be achieved within the specified accuracy. In addition, the treatment time is comparable with that of single isocenter multiple-arc treatments. (c) 2003 American College of Medical Physics	
3515	Matching the 6-MV photon beam characteristics of two dissimilar linear accelerators	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Photons, Quality Control, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Universities	A new prototype 6-MV flattening filter was designed by the manufacturer for use in a popular dual energy linear accelerator. To satisfy the contract demands, this filter was designed to produce a beam whose characteristics matched precisely with those of the 6-MV beam produced from a single photon peak energy unit from the same manufacturer and already in operation in the department. A single set of 6-MV dosimetric files for both units can now be maintained. The new filter has forced percent depth values over a wide clinical range of field sizes and depths to agree within 1.3%. Beam profiles now agree to within 1% over the useful area. For wedges with similar wedge angles, transmission factors now agree to within 1%. Standard acceptance testing performance specifications provided by the manufacturer were not adequate for clinical beam matching. The purchase contract for these units included our own specifications, which were more rigid and pertinent to our goal. Details of the effort are discussed	
4339	A simple and generally applicable method to estimate the peripheral dose in radiation teletherapy with high energy x-rays or gamma radiation	Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Genitalia,Female, Genitalia,Male, Humans, Male, Methods, Netherlands, Nuclear Medicine, Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotope Teletherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radioisotopes, Reference Values, Risk, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Scattering,Radiation, Uncertainty, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Many articles have been published on the measurement of the dose to points outside the primary beam, often called the peripheral dose (PD), for instance, to the gonads, for specific treatment machines and/or techniques. We investigated the possibilities for developing a generalized method based on the data from several publications. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data from several publications were recalculated for a reference situation, then averaged, and the frequency distributions around the mean were determined. Published data were available for 60Co, 4, 6, 8, and 10 MV, and 18 to 25 MV for a large variety of treatment machines. Furthermore, an analysis of possible corrections for depth dependence, field elongation, irregularly shaped fields, wedges, and shielding blocks was carried out. RESULTS: The frequency distributions of all published PD values for square fields for photon energies of 4 MV to 25 MV showed a standard deviation of 33%. The PD values of 60Co are significantly different with a standard deviation of 25%. A difference in the leakage radiation between cobalt machines and linear accelerators can possibly explain this difference, especially for large distances, where leakage radiation predominates. Taking the uncertainty of the risk factors into consideration, we conclude that the use of average values is justified. Although statistically not significant, the peripheral dose appears to be dependent on photon energy with a minimum around 6 MV. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to estimate the peripheral dose for photon energies of 4 MV to 25 MV with an accuracy of +/- 33%; for 60Co, the accuracy is even better. The variation of the PD between different treatment machines is so small that it is justified to use average PD values, irrespective of the treatment machine	
2325	A simplified approach to alpha dosimetry for small spheres labelled on the surface	Alpha Particles, Biophysics, Energy Transfer, France, Humans, Immunotherapy/mt [Methods], Models,Theoretical, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage	The radiation doses to spheres of radii 5-200 microns, labelled on the surface with alpha emitters were studied in order to simulate conditions of radioimmunotherapy for small tumours. The absorbed fraction of emitted energy and the mean absorbed dose per alpha particle in smaller concentric spherical targets were calculated for different source sizes. Calculations were first performed for monoenergetic emissions. We then considered the dosimetry of two common alpha emitters described in the literature (211At and 212Bi). The results agree well with different analytical approaches reported in the literature, but differ from those obtained using a Monte Carlo code. The computing features have been deliberately kept to a low level to allow for simple introduction into hospital work. Comparison of the mean absorbed dose per particle between alpha and beta emitters seems to favour the use of alpha emitters. However, their high toxicity introduces a practical radiation protection problem and our mathematical dosimetric approach is valid only for homogeneous distributions of radionuclides when, in the case of alpha emitters, the total dose delivered would be much too high to be of practical use

Beam and swept area characteristics	Efficiency, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Film Dosimetry, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	The characteristics of swept electron beams produced by Sagittaire or Saturne type accelerators were investigated by film dosimetry. Beam sections perpendicular to the beam limiting system (BLS) axis are fully described by Gaussian curves close to the centre of the field defined by the BLS, but they become more and more distorted as the elementary beam approaches the BLS. The swept area was also evaluated and was related to the magnitude of the current applied to the two orthogonal magnets of the sweeping system	
3678	Analytic calculation of electron beam isodose distributions	Electrons, Humans, Methods, Minicomputers, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research	Analytical techniques have been developed to generate electron beam isodose distributions from a modest set of experimental data. These techniques include (1) development of a compact yet powerful linear least-squares optimization program with a graphic display of the results, (2) coordinate transformations to allow straightforward fitting of the isodose distributions with simple polynomial functions, and (3) accurate interpolation methods to allow production of treatment planning dose matrices. The program, written in FORTRAN, has been implemented on a minicomputer and uses the standard peripherals of a commercially available treatment planning system (AECL TP-11). The computer-generated isodose and central-axis distributions correspond very closely with the data for electron energies from 5 to 20 MeV and for all field sizes	
334	Using multileaf collimator interleaf leakage to extract absolute spatial information from electronic portal imaging device images	Algorithms, Calibration, Electronics, Hematologic Diseases/ra [Radiography], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Portal System/ra [Radiography], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radon	Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) are potentially valuable tools for linear accelerator quality assurance and for measuring and analyzing geometric variations in radiation treatment delivery. Geometric analysis is more robust if referenced against an absolute position such as the isocenter (collimator axis of rotation), allowing the observer to discriminate between various setup errors and jaw or multileaf collimator (MLC) calibration errors. Unfortunately, mechanical instabilities in EPIDs make such analysis difficult. In the present work, we describe how MLC interleaf radiation leakage, hidden in the background of portal images, can be extracted and analyzed to find the field isocenter perpendicular to leaf travel direction. The signal from the interleaf radiation leakage is extracted to provide a precise and accurate determination of the isocenter location in the direction perpendicular to MLC leaf travel. In the direction of leaf travel, the minimization of residuals between planned and measured leaf positions is used to determine the isocenter. This method assumes that leaf positioning errors are randomly distributed. The validity of the method for determining the angular deviation between EPID image grid lines and collimator angle and for determining the known isocenter position is experimentally established

In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

The incorporated 125I provides Auger electron radiations which behave like high LET radiations in the treatment of tumours, though the accompanying X- and gamma-radiations make an undesirable contribution to the total body dose. The in vitro experiments reported show that 6-125I-iodo-MNDP is selectively concentrated in the cells of some human malignant tumours by factor of about 15 to 20 or more in relation to the cells of normal origin studied. On the basis of dosimetric considerations and comparison with clinical treatment with tritiated methylnaphthoquinol diphosphate, practical dosage of 6-125I-iodo-MNDP is suggested and clinical indications and safety of use are discussed. The types of tumour of particular interest are inoperable cases of carcinoma of the colon, carcinoma of the pancreas, malignant melanoma and osteosarcoma. Further investigations are in progress	
3410	Long-term results of helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Glaucoma,Neovascular/ep [Epidemiology], Helium, Humans, Ions, Melanoma, Melanoma/ep [Epidemiology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	Between 1978 and 1988, 307 patients with uveal melanoma were irradiated using helium ions at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The length of follow-up ranged from 1-115 months (median 42 months). The 5-year actuarial treatment results were: local control rate, 96.8%, determinate survival rate, 81%, freedom from distant metastases, 76%, eye retention rate, 83%, and risk of developing neovascular glaucoma, 36%. Long-term vision outcome was analyzed in 81 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Forty-seven percent of patients retained vision of 20/200 or better. The median change in vision was a loss of four lines on the standard eye chart. Thirty-eight percent of patients had visual acuity either improve or remain within two lines of their pretreatment vision. A multivariate analysis identified tumor size as the only independently significant risk factor affecting survival, development of neovascular glaucoma, or the risk of enucleation; no risk factor correlated with local recurrence. Tumor size, tumor-fovea distance, and pretreatment visual acuity were independently significant risk factors influencing vision outcome. These results confirm that helium ion irradiation is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma which combines high rates of local control, survival, and eye retention with a substantial likelihood of long-term vision preservation	
507	Prognostic significance of serial magnetic resonance spectroscopies over the course of radiation therapy for patients with malignant glioma	Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease Progression, Female, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Survival Analysis, Survivors	BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of high grade gliomas (HGG) involves maximal neuro-surgical debulking, followed by post-operative radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, depending on histologic grade. Despite this aggressive strategy, there are few long-term survivors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging method that can monitor metabolic changes in brain tumours. To date there is little data concerning the prognostic significance of the evolving spectral alterations during a course of radiotherapy. MATERIALS: We report herein a prospective study of patients with HGGs undergoing post-operative radiotherapy. Fourteen consecutively eligible patients with a confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant glioma and completion of all required MRS imaging were included in this study. All patients had MRS imaging prior to radiotherapy, at week 4 of radiotherapy, and 2 months post-treatment. T1 and T2 weighted images as well as post-gadolinium multi-voxel proton MRS images were obtained. Normalized (tumour metabolite/normal brain metabolite) levels of choline, NAA, creatine, lipid and lactate were calculated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of progression-free and overall survival were constructed based on the evolving patterns of metabolite changes over the course of the images. RESULTS: The mean tumour choline/NAA ratio decreased over the course of therapy, with a reduction observed between the baseline and post-radiotherapy studies (1.91 vs. 1.29, P=0.049). A similar decrease was identified with the mean normalized choline ratio, with a highly significant difference observed between the baseline and post-radiation images (1.61 vs. 0.96, P=0.001). Patients who exhibited more than 40% decrease in normalized choline between the week 4 and post-radiotherapy studies were associated with unfavourable survival (logrank test, P=0.003) and disease progression (logrank test, P=0.012). The Lactate/NAA ratio at the 4th week of radiotherapy and the change in normalized choline/creatine between baseline and week 4 of radiotherapy were also predictive of outcome suggesting the possibility of adaptive, response-based radiation treatment. Patients with two or more poor prognostic MRS indices had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with zero or one poor indices, with 15% and 68% at 1 year, respectively (logrank test, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The evolving pattern of spectral changes over the course of radiotherapy, in particular those associated with choline-containing compounds, appears to be prognostic of tumour response and outcome. Based on our data, a decision point may exist in the mid course of radical radiotherapy, at which time consideration of the choline levels could indicate the extent of radiotherapeutic response, thus allowing for individualized treatment modification

In vitro low doses of alpha particle irradiation due to radon have an antiproliferative effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells and increase the sensibility of cancer cells to taxol, a chemotherapeutic agent that induces cellular apoptosis. The present study examines the in vitro effects of low doses of alpha particle irradiation from the gas radon on the expression of some bcl-2 family apoptosis-related genes. The analyzed genes were bax, bcl-2 and bcl-x, with known responses to genotoxic stress (bcl-2) or ionising radiation (bax and bcl-x) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The results obtained indicate that the cell line studied expresses the mentioned genes and they demonstrate that irradiation with low radon doses of MCF-7 cells induces underexpression of both bax and bcl-2 genes. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of the full-length bcl-x gene (bcl-xL) were overexpressed after irradiation, and we found significant mRNA levels of an alternative mRNA splicing form of the same gene (bcl-xS), which enhances the apoptotic sensitivity of the cell. The increased sensitivity to apoptosis resulting from bcl-xS overexpression is important because it might improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancers which act through induction of apoptosis. The finding that low radiation doses of alpha particles from the gas radon modulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes suggests a therapeutic utility for this naturally occurring agent	
3217	[Topographic and dosimetric considerations in different methods of proton irradiation]. [Russian]	Humans, Methods, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Uncertainty	Two techniques are employed for proton irradiation: one--to pass a proton beam through a target, the other one--to stop in it. The advantage of the first technique is a very small angular divergence of the beam penetrating tissues or, consequently, a very high lateral edge field gradient. The second technique has two additional advantages: the absence of radiation lesions behind the target and an increase in the stopping power (dose) at the end of the beam range localized in the target. The authors present their considerations concerning the applicability of each technique and certain characteristic problems of the second technique. Dose field deformations as a result of topometric uncertainties are also estimated. A method of dose design aimed at minimizing the above mentioned effect is proposed	
1016	Clinical and research validity of hadrontherapy with ion beams. [Review] [55 refs]	Animals, Carbon, Humans, Ions, Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Italy, Japan, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Survival	Clinical results obtained with hadrontherapy have been extremely positive for various tumours, with percentages of local control and survival higher than those ascribed to conventional radiotherapy. Most clinical data obtained with charged particles are related to protontherapy but the implementation of carbon ion therapy has demonstrated to be of great interest in the last decade. These results, accompanied by the new performances in accelerator technology and calculation systems of the delivered doses, have determined over the past years an increased interest for the development of hadrontherapy, with the construction of new centres provided with equipment entirely dedicated to clinical activity (LLUMC, Loma Linda and NPTC, Boston in USA, HIMAC-NIRS, Chiba, PROBEAT, Tsukuba, and Hyogo Beam Medical Centres in Japan). A revision of the clinical indications specifically focused on ion therapy is presented as well as the results obtained in the different centres. With hadrontherapy, it is finally possible to increase the spectrum of treatments allowing preserving the organ and its functionality, with positive impacts from a social and economic point of view.

2576	Uveal lymphoid neoplasia: a clinical-pathologic correlation and review of the early form	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Fluorescein Angiography, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Ultrasonography, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Uveal Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	We report three cases of uveal lymphoid neoplasia that were diagnosed early in their course. One case exhibited a posterior form, presenting with progressive hyperopia from a serous-macular detachment and choroidal involvement along with retrobulbar involvement. This patient was treated with proton beam irradiation. Two cases displayed an anterior form, with fixed fleshy epibulbar masses resembling salmon patches, and choroidal involvement. The histologic findings from biopsy of these anterior masses are presented. One of these patients was treated with complete excision of the mass and double freeze-thaw cryotherapy of the scleral bed, and the other patient was treated with conventional photon beam irradiation. The clinical features of uveal lymphoid neoplasia in its early form are discussed. Evaluation and treatment strategies for these early forms of uveal lymphoid neoplasia are reviewed	
2244	Characteristics of the photon beam from a new 25-MV linear accelerator	Arm, Head, Heart, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation]	The Therac 25 is a relatively compact therapy machine, the heart of which is a double-pass electron linear accelerator. The electron beam is injected into the accelerator at the treatment head end of the machine and is accelerated back down the arm to an energy of 13 MeV. At this end of the machine a magnet system reflects the beam back into the structure where it gains up to an additional 12 MeV of energy. After leaving the linear accelerator the beam is bent by an achromatic head magnet through 270 degrees to the treatment head. The machine produces eight electron beams and a 25-MV photon beam. In this work only the parameters of the photon beam are addressed based on measurements at the first two clinical sites. Percentage depth doses, tissue phantom ratios, and beam symmetry and stability are presented and discussed	
3570	Non-invasive follow-up of patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations after proton-beam radiation therapy	Angiography, Cerebral Angiography, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Radiation, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Ultrasonography, Universities	In order better to follow non-invasively the effect of proton beam therapy upon intracranial arteriovenous malformations, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) was used in 10 patients, in addition to conventional follow-up with angiography and computed tomography (CT); in six patients, pre- and postradiation TCD studies were obtained. The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy

The object was to examine the use of BANG gel for the verification of proton fields in eye tumor therapy and to explore the applicability of polymer gel dosimetry in proton therapy under practical aspects. The gel phantoms were irradiated with monoenergetic and modulated proton beams. MRI analysis was carried out at clinical 1.5 and 3 T MR scanners. At constant LET, results show a linear relationship between spin-spin relaxation rates and dose. However, depth dose curves in BANG gel reveal a quenching of the Bragg maximum due to LET effects. The dose response of the gel for monoenergetic protons and spread-out depth dose distributions can be calculated based on ionization chamber measurements. Experiment and calculations show good agreement and indicate that BANG polymer gels might become a valuable tool in proton therapy quality assurance	
3289	Treatment planning for stereotactic radiosurgery of intra-cranial lesions	Adolescent, Adult, Angiography, Boston, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Eye, Female, Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation, Stereotaxic Techniques	Stereotactic radiosurgery of intra-cranial lesions is a treatment modality where a well defined target volume receives a high radiation dose in a single treatment. Our technique delivers this dose using a set of non-coplanar arcs and small circular collimators. We use a standard linear accelerator in our treatments, and the adjustable treatment parameters are: isocenter location, gantry arc rotation interval, couch angle, collimator field size, and dose. The treatment planning phase of the treatment determines these parameters such that the target volume is sufficiently irradiated, and dose to surrounding healthy tissue and critical, dose-limiting structures is minimized. The attachment of a BRW localizing frame to the patient's cranium combined with CT imaging (and optionally MRI or angiography) provides the required accuracy for localizing individual structures in the treatment volume. The treatment is fundamentally 3-dimensional and requires a volumetric assessment of the treatment plan. The selection of treatment arcs relies primarily on geometric constraints and the beam's eye view concept to avoid irradiating critical structures. The assessment of a treatment plan involves isodose distributions throughout the volume and integral dose-volume histograms. We present the essential concepts of our treatment planning approach, and illustrate these in three clinical cases	
3684	Investigation of applicability of alanine and radiochromic detectors to dosimetry of proton clinical beams	Alanine, Chromium Radioisotopes, Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy, Humans, Japan, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Russia, United States	Cancer therapy studies using proton accelerators are underway in several major medical centers in the U.S., Russia, Japan and elsewhere. To facilitate dosimetry intercomparisons between these laboratories, alanine-based detectors produced at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and commercially available radiochromic films were studied for their possible use as passive transfer dosimeters for clinical proton beams. Evaluation of characteristics of these instruments, including the LET dependence of their response of proton energy, was carried out at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Results of absolute dose measurements were regarded as a preliminary step of dose intercomparison between ITEP and NIST. Measurements made in a number of experiments showed average agreement between the ITEP and NIST dosimetry standards to 2.5%	
3049	The severity of alpha-particle-induced DNA damage is revealed by exposure to cell-free extracts	Alpha Particles, Cell-Free System, DNA, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, DNA,Single-Stranded/re [Radiation Effects], Efficiency, Environment, Genome, Humans, Hydroxyl Radical, Radiation, Radon, Research	The rejoining of single-strand breaks induced by alpha-particle and gamma irradiation in plasmid DNA under two scavenging conditions has been compared. At the two scavenger capacities used of 1.5 x 10(7) and 3 x 10(6) s-1 using Tris-HCl as the scavenger, the ratio of single- to double-strand breaks for alpha particles is fivefold less than the corresponding ratios for gamma irradiation. The repair of such radiation-induced single-strand breaks has been examined using a cell-free system derived from human whole-cell extracts. We show that the rejoining of single-strand breaks for both alpha-particle- and gamma-irradiated plasmid is dependent upon the scavenging capacity and that the efficiency of rejoining of alpha-particle-induced single-strand breaks is significantly less than that observed for gamma-ray-induced breaks. In addition, for DNA that had been irradiated under conditions that mimic the cellular environment with respect to the radical scavenging capacity, 50% of alpha-particle-induced single-strand breaks are converted to double-strand breaks, in contrast with only approximately 12% conversion of gamma-ray-induced single-strand breaks, indicating that the initial damage caused by alpha particles is more severe. These studies provide experimental evidence for increased clustering of damage which may have important implications for the induction of cancer by low-level alpha-particle sources such as domestic radon

The numbers and types of chromatid breaks were detected using the premature chromosome condensation technique. Irradiation with (12)C(6+) ions produced a majority of isochromatid break types, while chromatid breaks were dominant for irradiation with gamma-rays. Experimental results showed that the initial level of chromatid breaks is clearly related to the absorbed dose from (12)C(6+) ions and gamma-rays. The (12)C(6+) ions are relatively more effective at inducing initial chromatid breaks when compared with the gamma-rays. A relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of about 2.5 resulted for the induction of initial chromatid breaks by (12)C(6+) ions relative to gamma-rays in both cell lines

The cause of this leakage was analyzed and the amount of leakage was measured for different electron beam energies. The highest leakage occurred with a 6 x 6 cm cone using a 12 MeV electron beam. The leakage dose measured along the side of the cone could be as great as 40%. Until the cones are modified or redesigned, it is advised that all patient setups be carefully reviewed to assure that no significant patient areas are in the side scatter region

METHODS: Modern skull base surgical techniques were used in all patients who were treated between August 1991 and July 2000. The degree of tumor resection was gauged according to intraoperative inspection and postoperative high-resolution imaging findings. There were 21 patients with primary disease and eight with recurrent disease. Total resection was accomplished in 18 patients. Five patients had undergone radiotherapy prior to the present surgery, and an additional eight patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. There were no surgery-related deaths. In five patients who died of the disease, surgery and radiotherapy had failed to effect a cure. Two of the remaining patients are alive with recurrent disease, and there is questionable evidence of recurrence in another patient. All 24 patients are functioning independently. Cranial nerve impairment was the most common postoperative deficit, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull base techniques in radical surgery provides an opportunity to excise the tumor and the involved bone. In most cases the procedure-related cranial nerve deficits improve over time. The complications of CSF leakage and infection can be minimized and are preventable. Proton beam irradiation is an excellent adjuvant treatment but is reserved for patients with definite tumor recurrence or residual tumor that can be identified on the imaging studies

To understand better these relations, four groups of cases were examined: 1.) 126 choroidal melanomas which were treated conservatively with Cobalt 60 applicator from 1969 till 1984. 2.) 715 choroidal melanomas which have been treated with proton-beam from 1984 to 1989. 3.) 7 tumors or pseudotumors for which for diagnostic purposes a phosphorus 32 test was necessary. 4.) 9 choroid melanomas which had conservative treatment and where vitrectomy was realized. The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment the thickness of the tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in choroid melanoma which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature

The development of RIT with alpha-emitters is attractive, owing to the high (LET) nature and short path length of alpha particles allowing for higher tumor cell kill and lower toxicity to healthy tissues. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the response of B-Cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells in vitro after treatment with chemotherapy (cisplatin, fludarabine, doxorubicin, or vincristine) or other pharmaceuticals (colchicine, simvastatin, or cyclosporin A) in combination with (60)Co-gamma or (213)Bi-alpha-irradiation. METHODS: (213)Bi was eluted from a (225)Ac generator. Apoptosis was scored by flow cytometric analysis of the cells stained with Annexin-V and 7 amino actinomycin D. Metabolic activity was assessed by a MTT assay. RESULTS: The response induced by alpha- irradiation is systematically higher than the response induced by gamma-irradiation. The combination of drug treatment with alpha-irradiation induced a systematic, higher response, compared to treatment with drugs alone, even for the highest concentrations used. For all the drugs used in this study, synergism or additivity was demonstrated for the combination of drugs and radiotherapy with a stronger effect for alpha-particles. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this in vitro study highlight a potential benefit of alpha-irradiation in combination with the drugs considered in this study

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

A computer code to simulate the transport of protons in water (PETRA) has been used to calculate sw.air-data under different degrees of complexity, ranging from values based on primary protons only to data including secondary electrons and high-energy secondary protons produced in nonelastic nuclear collisions. All numerical data are based on ICRU 49 proton stopping powers. Calculations using primary protons have been compared to the simple continuous slowing-down approximation (c.s.d.a.) analytical technique used in proton dosimetry protocols, not finding significant differences that justify elaborate Monte Carlo simulations except beyond the mean range of the protons (the far side of the Bragg peak). The influence of nuclear nonelastic processes, through the detailed generation and transport of secondary protons, on the calculated stopping-power ratios has been found to be negligible. The effect of alpha particles has also been analysed, finding differences smaller than 0.1% from the results excluding them. Discrepancies of up to 0.6% in the plateau region have been found, however, when the production and transport of secondary electrons are taken into account. The large influence of nonelastic nuclear interactions on proton depth-dose distributions shows that the removal of primary protons from the incident beam decreases the peak-to-plateau ratio by a large factor, up to 40% at 250 MeV. It is therefore emphasized that nonelastic nuclear reactions should be included in Monte Carlo simulations of proton beam depth-dose distributions

1263	Combined infrared multiphoton dissociation and electron capture dissociation with a hollow electron beam in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry	Animals, Cattle, Cyclotrons, Electrons, Humans, Infrared Rays, Ions, Peptides/an [Analysis], Photons, Physics, Proteins/an [Analysis], Spectroscopy,Fourier Transform Infrared/mt [Methods], Sweden, Time	An electron injection system based on an indirectly heated ring-shaped dispenser cathode has been developed and installed in a 7 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. This new hardware design allows high-rate electron capture dissociation (ECD) to be carried out by a hollow electron beam coaxial with the ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) trap. Infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) can also be performed with an on-axis IR-laser beam passing through a hole at the centre of the dispenser cathode. Electron and photon irradiation times of the order of 100 ms are required for efficient ECD and IRMPD, respectively. As ECD and IRMPD generate fragments of different types (mostly c, z and b, y, respectively), complementary structural information that improves the characterization of peptides and proteins by FTICR mass spectrometry can be obtained. The developed technique enables the consecutive or simultaneous use of the ECD and IRMPD methods within a single FTICR experimental sequence and on the same ensemble of trapped ions in multistage tandem (MS/MS/MS or MS(n)) mass spectrometry. Flexible changing between ECD and IRMPD should present advantages for the analysis of protein digests separated by liquid chromatography prior to FTICRMS. Furthermore, ion activation by either electron or laser irradiation prior to, as well as after, dissociation by IRMPD or ECD increases the efficiency of ion fragmentation, including the w-type fragment ion formation, and improves sequencing of peptides with multiple disulfide bridges. The developed instrumental configuration is essential for combined ECD and IRMPD on FTICR mass spectrometers with limited access into the ICR trap. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	
2776	The design of an adjustable half block for nonasymmetric linear accelerators	Canada, Equipment Design, Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Universities	Half-block techniques in radiotherapy may be used to junction two abutting radiation fields. Removable half blocks for linear accelerators not equipped with asymmetrical jaws can accomplish this technique providing the block edge is properly secured with respect to the beam central axis to achieve a smooth beam junction. Successive block edge cuts with a milling machine are, however, required to achieve an acceptable junction of the fields. The design of a half-block device that allows secure adjustment of the block edge on the linac thus alleviating the need for successive milling procedures is presented	
789	Increase of enamel fluoride retention by low fluence argon laser beam: a 6-month follow-up study in vivo	Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride/ad [Administration & Dosage], Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Dental Caries/pc [Prevention & Control], Dental Enamel/me [Metabolism], Dental Enamel/re [Radiation Effects], Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Laser Therapy,Low-Level, Time, Water	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 6-month in vivo study was to investigate if argon laser irradiation of enamel can increase the retention of fluoride. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight teeth in 12 patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) EF group: 40 teeth were only treated with fluoride gel (applied for 5 minutes followed by a 1 minute rinsing with distilled water). (2) EFL group: 40 teeth were treated the same way as in the EF group but they were lased after fluoridation. (3) E group: 18 teeth were kept without any treatment as a control group. In order to quantify the fluoride content in the enamel samples, the teeth were analyzed by proton beam delivered by a tandem accelerator (PIgE, particle induced gamma-ray emission). A low energy density of argon laser beam was used: 10.74 J/cm2 (11 mm of beam diameter, irradiation time of 30 seconds, and an output power of 340 mW in continuous mode). RESULTS: The results after 6 months showed that the lased enamel still retained 52.55+/-8.47 ppm or 14.12% of fluoride after the fluoridation process, whereas the unlased enamel retained only 12.18+/-6.82 ppm or 3.27% of fluoride. The untreated and control enamel (E group: unlased and without fluoride treatment) had 1.16+/-4.27 ppm value of fluoride. The statistical test (ANOVA tests at 95% level) showed that the difference is significant between the fluoride retention in the group EFL and the group EF 6 months after fluoridation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of argon laser at low energy density (10.74 J/cm2) significantly increased the fluoride retention in lased enamel that had approximately 400 times more fluoride than the unlased enamel. We consider this procedure as an alternative clinical procedure to increase the fluoride content of enamel surface. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc	
2403	The application of nuclear magnetic resonance data to radiation therapy	Energy Transfer, Humans, Hydrogen, Knowledge, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Neutrons, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Time	The appropriate therapeutic modality for a patient with a malignancy depends on knowledge of the extent of the disease. If the disease is localized and suited for a course of conventional radiotherapy, delineation of the borders of the gross tumor is necessary for treatment planning. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance scan may be useful in precisely delineating the extent of the tumor due to large differences in the spin-lattice relaxation times between normal and malignant tissues. Proton NMR scanning can also be used to provide information on the relative hydrogen concentration of various tissues in situ. Knowledge of the hydrogen concentration is required to calculate the dose to an organ irradiated with a fast neutron beam	
3872	High intensity 125-iodine (125I) plaque treatment of uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, California, Californium, Helium, Humans, Incidence, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Melanoma, Melanoma/ep [Epidemiology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Episcleral 125I plaque therapy of uveal melanoma is an important treatment modality to control tumor, salvage the globe, and potentially preserve vision. We retrospectively analyzed our experience in 239 patients to assess treatment outcome with this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1990, 239 uveal melanoma patients were treated with 125I plaques at the University of California, San Francisco. High intensity 125I seeds in the range of 3-20 mCi were used to give a minimum tumor dose of 70 Gy in 4 days. Initial mean tumor size was 10.9 mm x 9.2 mm x 5.5 mm with a range in tumor diameter from 4 to 18 mm and tumor height from 1.9 to 11.1 mm. Best corrected pre-treatment visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 92% of patients. RESULTS: Local tumor control was maintained in 91.7% of patients with a mean follow-up of 35.9 months; 19 patients had local tumor progression; mean time to progression was 27.3 mo (1.8 to 60.1 mo). Actuarial local control is 82% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrates significant correlation of local failure with larger maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0008), closer proximity to the fovea (p = 0.0001), lower radiation dose (p = 0.0437), and smaller ultrasound height (p = 0.0034). The actuarial incidence of distant metastases is 12% at 5 years with multivariate analysis showing significant correlation only with maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0064). Visual outcome is 20/200 or better in 58% of patients. CONCLUSION: While the tumor control rates appear favorable, ocular morbidity is significant. A current randomized trial comparing 125I plaque with Helium ion therapy is in progress with specific comparison of tumor control, survival, and visual outcome

Besides the physical selectivity that makes ions especially efficient for deep-seated tumours and tumours close to critical organs, carbon ions with their enhanced relative biological effectiveness offer an additional biological advantage for slow-growing radioresistant tumours, with an additional gain for tumours with hypoxic sections. These advantages can only be fully exploited by active beam-shaping and biology-based treatment planning	
3522	Study of biological effects of varying mixtures of Cf-252 and gamma radiation on the acute radiation syndromes: relevance to clinical radiotherapy of radioresistant cancer	Animals, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], California, Californium, Cesium Radioisotopes, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Digestive System/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Methods, Mice, Mice,Inbred BALB C, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Syndrome, Universities, Whole-Body Irradiation	PURPOSE: Data for the 30 day bone marrow syndrome (BM-50) and the 6-10 day gastrointestinal (GI-50) syndrome for a one and two fraction schedule and acute and low dose rate irradiation using pure and mixed Cf-252 and photon radiation are presented. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The radiations of Cf-252 is a mixture of neutrons and gamma rays. We total body irradiated Balb/c mice of both sexes with acute Co-60, low dose rate Cs-137 and Cf-252 using a 1 x and 2 x schedule. For low linear energy transfer radiations of Co-60 or Cs-137 there was expected to be an increase in the dose to produce the gastrointestinal and bone marrow syndromes with minimal change for Cf-252 neutrons. However, the radiations from Cf-252 are approximately 65% neutrons and approximately 35% photons and hence some repair may be expected. We further altered the proportion of photons in the Cf-252 radiation field by mixing Cs-137 with the Cf-252 sources and total body irradiated the mice to determine the effects on the syndromes. We determined the effects of mixing Cf-252 neutrons with different proportions of photons on the radiation syndromes. RESULTS: There was increase in BM-50 and GI-50 doses with fractionated or low dose rate photon irradiations and the dose modifying factors were 1.3-1.4 for the GI syndrome and 1.2 for the bone marrow syndrome. For Cf-252 there was minimal fractionation effect for the GI-50 syndrome, which increased by a 1.1 for x 1 vs. x 2 fractions; for the BM-50 syndrome it rose by a 1.1 factor. For LDR Cs-137 the dose for the GI-50 syndrome rose by a 2.2 fold. For mixed neutron-photon radiation of 0%, 15%, 35%, and 65% eta/gamma mixtures, the dose to produce the BM-50 and GI-50 endpoints dropped sharply from 0 to 35% neutrons and remained flat thereafter. CONCLUSION: For major tissues such as the bone marrow and G-I tract, Cf-252 behaved as high linear energy transfer for mixtures of neutrons and gamma rays of approximately 35% neutrons when the radiation were delivered simultaneously at the low dose rates studied. There was little or no additional contribution to the effectiveness of the mixed radiations if neutrons contributed 35% or more of the dose	
2257	Microdosimetry of 10-15 MeV bremsstrahlung x rays	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, X-Rays	Experimental techniques have been developed for obtaining microdosimetric spectra on a hospital-based linear accelerator. Teletherapy beams of 10 and 15 MeV bremsstrahlung x rays from a Varian Clinac-18 and Clinac-20, respectively, have been produced at ultralow dose rates (50-200 microGy/h) which enables direct measurements of lineal energy distributions with a conventional Rossi-type gas proportional counter. Extensive measurements have been made to insure that the dosimetric properties of these low dose rate beams are nearly identical to those produced under high dose rate clinical conditions. Analytical procedures have been developed to correct measured lineal energy spectra for pileup caused by the low duty factor of the linear accelerator. The lineal energy spectra of these megavoltage beams differ significantly from Co-60, with dose averaged lineal energies (yD) being 20%-30% lower than for Co-60. Although such differences may not be important at clinical doses, the theory of dual radiation action does predict a lower biological effectiveness for these beams at very low dose levels

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 51 NSCLC patients were treated with proton beams at the University of Tsukuba. There were 28 patients in Stage I, 9 in Stage II, 8 in Stage III, 1 in Stage IV, and 5 with recurrent disease. Thirty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 17 had adenocarcinoma, and 1 had large-cell carcinoma. Median fraction and total doses given were 3.0 Gy (range 2.0-6.0 Gy), and 76.0 Gy (range 49.0-93.0 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 29% for all patients, 70% for 9 Stage IA patients, and 16% for 19 Stage IB patients, respectively (IA vs. IB: p < 0.05). The 5-year in-field local control rate was higher in patients with Stage IA (89%) when compared with those with Stage IB (39%). Forty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute lung toxicity of Grade 1 or less; 3 had Grade 2, 1 had Grade 3, and none experienced Grade 4 or higher. Patients in the present series showed very little late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is a very safe and effective treatment for patients with NSCLC, especially for those with early stages. The relative merit of proton therapy in comparison with stereotactic photon radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy remains to be defined through future clinical trials

Between September 1988 and December 1997 a total of 973 patients (26,916 fields) had been treated on the 66 MeV p+Be isocentric neutron therapy system. Patients are currently being treated according to several protocols, including tumors of the head and neck, salivary gland and breast and soft tissue sarcomas, uterine sarcomas and paranasal sinuses. A multiblade post-collimator trimmer has recently being installed. This device provides improved neutron beam shaping capability. Between September 1993 and December 1997 a total of 243 patients (4008 fields) had been treated (mainly intracranial stereotactic irradiations) on the fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton therapy facility. The facility incorporates an innovative automatic patient positioning system. Two new fixed beam lines for proton therapy are presently being designed (horizontal and 30 degrees to the vertical) for an existing unused treatment vault. Spot scanning systems will be developed for both beam lines

Hyperprolactinemia of various degrees was observed in 11 of 13 patients (84%). The summary index SFM (the male sexual formula) and a PRL level showed negative correlation. There was no significant difference in LH response to LH-RH administration between patients with normal and disturbed sexual function. Radiation therapy, in particular proton-beam therapy, produced no negative influence on male sexual function in a long-term period after therapy

The alpha-particle irradiator is based on a radioactive (212)Pb/(212)Bi source. In the experimental setup proposed, cells are grown directly on a polylysine-coated track-etch material that forms the base of custom-made cell dishes. Alpha-particle irradiation is done through the base of the dish. Immediately prior to irradiation, the cell dish is scanned under a microscope, and images of cells with the corresponding coordinates are saved. After irradiation and after the biological end point under study has been determined, the cell dish is etched to develop alpha-particle tracks in the dish base. A microscope image series of alpha-particle track images is obtained by accurately revisiting every original (preirradiation) cell position in the track-etched dish. The number of alpha-particle traversals of each individual cell is scored by mapping images of alpha-particle tracks onto the images of cells recorded prior to irradiation. The uncertainty of the alpha-particle hit determination is 0.9 microm. The procedure described thus presents a method for radiobiological experiments with absolute, rather than statistical, cell dosimetry

We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone

On the basis of its histopathology, the tumor must be classified as a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The latest data in the literature give cause for a little more optimism thanks to the introduction of the most recent schemes of chemotherapy combined with large-dose radiation for consolidation. Our patient was treated with chemotherapy CHOP high-dose radiation which resulted in complete disappearance of the mediastinal mass and rapid remission of the severe symptoms of mediastinal compression. After about 30 months, instrumental and laboratory findings confirm the persistence of the complete remission

2394	Quality control of measured x-ray beam data	Biophysics, Humans, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Pennsylvania, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Probability, Quality Control, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards], Scattering,Radiation, Universities, Water	The purpose of this study was to examine whether the quality of measured x-ray beam data can be judged from how well the data agree with a semiempirical formula. Tissue-phantom ratios (TPR) and output factors for several accelerators in the energy range 4-25 MV were fitted to the formula, separating the dose contributions from primary and phantom-scattered photons. The former was described by exponential attenuation in water, with beam hardening, and the latter by the scatter-to-primary dose ratio using two parameters related to the probability and the directional distribution of the scattered photons. Electron disequilibrium was not considered. Two approaches were evaluated. In one, the attenuation and hardening coefficients were determined from measurements in a narrow-beam geometry; in the other, they were extracted by the fitting procedure. Measured and fitted data agreed within +/- 2% in both cases. The differences were randomly distributed and had a standard deviation of typically 0.7%. Singular points with errors were easily identified. Systematic errors were revealed by increased standard deviation. However, when the attenuation was derived by the fitting algorithm, the attenuation coefficient deviated significantly from the experimental value. It is concluded that the semiempirical formula can serve to evaluate and verify beam data measured in water and that the physically most accurate description requires that the attenuation and hardening coefficients be determined in a narrow-beam geometry. The attenuation coefficient is an excellent measure of both the primary and the scatter dose component, i.e., of beam quality

The influence on the dose distribution exerted by the kind of radiation and its energy, the rotation angle of the patient's table, and the field dimensions was determined. The quality of the side radiation and the effect of additional lead shieldings were examined. The dose distributions can be calculated approximately by means of an exponent which can be used in order to estimate the surface dose for all desired irradiation conditions and to determine any distances from the field edges

Protons have favorable physical characteristics which allow the delivery of high doses of radiation to these critically located tumors. The methods employed for these treatments are described. These patients have been followed for at least 17 months and for a median of 34 months. The median tumor dose was 69 CGE (cobalt Gy equivalent): CGE is the dose in proton Gy multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons compared to cobalt-60. The daily dose was 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. For this group the 5-year actuarial local control rate is 82% and disease-free survival rate is 76%. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity has been acceptable

A correlation was established between the blood level of alpha 1--antitrypsin and the subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spreading. Consequently, the assay of the level of this inhibitor is suggested as another test for assessment of the efficacy of treatment of such patients and prediction of the results	
3343	Errors in off-axis treatment planning for a 4-MeV machine	Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	Computer treatment planning systems allow dose computation in planes parallel to the central one (off-axis plans). The beam data may consist of, e.g., percentage depth doses along the central axis plus off-axis ratios (OAR) at several depths. In some systems, the calculation of an off-axis plan is based on the assumption that the OAR can be represented by a separable function: OAR(x,y) = f(x).g(y), where x and y are the symmetry axes perpendicular to the beam axis and the functions f and g are equal for a square open field. The errors of this assumption for a 4-MeV machine were measured for open fields and wedged fields at five different depths. The measured dose was compared with that predicted by the above equation for 50%, 75%, and 88% of the half field width from the beam axis. Maximum deviation of more than 10% was observed with the probable error of the measurement being 1%	
149	Pathological changes in surgically resected angiographically occult vascular malformations after radiation	Cerebral Angiography, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pa [Pathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Research, Retreatment, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the pathological changes associated with radiation treatment (stereotactic radiosurgery or conventional irradiation) of angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe, brain stem, thalamus, or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment. The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient. Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high. Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution. One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin. The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a helium-ion particle beam. The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents. The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous malformations. RESULTS: One irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult. This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of helium-ion radiosurgery. Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately. Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations, six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels, fibrinoid necrosis, and ferrugination. However, the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls. All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels; none were completely thrombosed. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years (mean 3.5 yr) after radiation delivery. It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients. However, recurrent bleeding from AOVMs may relate to poor radiation response in some patients	
2939	Kinetics of the formation of chromosome aberrations in X-irradiated human lymphocytes: analysis by premature chromosome condensation with delayed fusion	Animals, Cell Fusion, Cells,Cultured, Centromere, CHO Cells, Chromosome Aberrations, Chromosomes/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosomes/ul [Ultrastructure], Cricetinae, DNA, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Germany, Humans, Kinetics, Lead, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Time, Time Factors, X-Rays	Human lymphocytes irradiated with graded doses of up to 5 Gy of 150 kV X rays were fused with mitotic CHO cells after delay times ranging from 0 to 14 h after irradiation. The yields of dicentrics seen under PCC conditions, using C-banding for centromere detection, and of excess acentric fragments observed in the PCC experiment were determined by image analysis. At 4 Gy the time course of the yield of dicentrics shows an early plateau for delay times up to 2 h, then an S-shaped rise and a final plateau which is reached after a delay time of about 8 to 10 h. Whereas the dose-yield curve measured at zero delay time is strictly linear, the shape of the curve obtained for 8 h delay time is linear-quadratic. The linear yield component, alpha D, is formed entirely in the fast process manifested in the early plateau, while component beta D2 is developed slowly in the subsequent hours. Analysis of the kinetics of the rise of the S-shaped curve for yield as a function of time leads to the postulate of an "intermediate product" of pairwise DNA lesion interaction, still fragile when subjected to the stress of PCC, but gradually processed into a stable dicentric chromosome. It is concluded that the observed difference in the kinetics of the alpha and beta components explains a number of earlier results, especially the disappearance of the beta component at high LET, and opens possibilities for chemical and physical modification of the beta component during the extended formation process after irradiation observed here	
4490	Irradiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors: analysis by positron emission tomography and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy	Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast, Cell Differentiation/ph [Physiology], Female, Humans, Japan, Lung, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Effects, Radiation Injuries, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Universities	To evaluate irradiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors treated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery, positron emission tomography (PET) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies were performed on five patients. The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury	
4025	Proton radiography as a tool for quality control in proton therapy	Animals, Calibration, Head, Humans, Models,Structural, Protons, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiography, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, Safety, Sheep, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods], Uncertainty	Proton radiography is investigated for its use as a quality control tool in proton therapy. Images were produced both with range and range uncertainty information of protons passing through phantoms (Alderson phantom and a sheep's head). With the range images the correct positioning of the patient with respect to the beam could be verified. The range uncertainty images were used to quantitatively detect range variations of protons passing through inhomogeneities in the patient. These measurements can be used to indicate critical situations during proton therapy or to determine the safety margin around the tumor volume. With the range information the precision of different calibrations of computer tomography Hounsfield values to relative proton stopping power, used for proton treatment planning, was determined. It is found that the precision in range can be improved by a detailed analysis of the calibration data obtained from tissue-substitute measurements, by a factor of 2.5. The resulting range errors are in the order of the positioning precision (approximately 1 mm)

Good clinical results have been reported in uveal melanomas and in sarcomas of the skull base. Calculated dose distributions for the treatment of brain, lung, head and neck and pelvic tumours predict an improvement relative to multiple-field or conformal photon radiotherapy. Protons may well provide high-precision radiotherapy that will lead to improved treatment of certain tumours in specific anatomical locations. [References: 40]	
2078	Chromosomal aberrations of blood lymphocytes induced in vitro by radon-222 daughter alpha-irradiation	Accidents,Radiation, Alpha Particles, Austria, Biophysics, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Lipid Peroxidation/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Metaphase, Physics, Power Plants, Radiation, Radon, Radon/to [Toxicity], Time Factors, Ukraine, Universities	Blood samples were irradiated in vitro with alpha-rays emitted from short-lived radon decay products dissolved in the culture medium at doses between 0.03 and 41.4 mGy. The data were collected from experiments conducted during the period 1984-1992 and comprise a total of about 64000 scored metaphases. For statistical reasons, only 60,022 metaphases were used for the subsequent analysis. The results for total chromosome aberrations and dicentrics indicate a linear dose dependence in the dose range above about 10 mGy, consistent with other experimental observations. At doses below about 10 mGy, aberration frequencies cannot be linearly extrapolated from higher doses, suggesting that there is no dependence on dose within a certain low-dose range. In addition, a statistically significant minimum has been observed at a dose of about 0.03 mGy, which is consistently lower than the related control values. The behavior of the aberration frequencies in the low-dose region seems to be influenced by the control values, which also depend on the environmental radiation burdens to the donors before blood sampling and thus were significantly affected by the Chernobyl fallout

In relation with the first experience at the Croix-Rousse Hospital with orthovoltage, a review of technical choices, surgical problems, and biological questions is presented. The analysis of literature about accumulated clinical results suggest that local control in recurrence, residual, or inoperable tumor can be obtained by combined surgery IOR, and external beam irradiation. This short experience demonstrate the feasibility of the treatment as a routine and emphasizes the need for continued study

Surgery and chemotherapy have also been used either before, after, or during radiation therapy, aiming at further improvement of local control of cancer. Intraoperative irradiation, which was firstly developed in Japan, has been applied for treatment of cancers arising from stomach, pancreas and the tumors requiring further improvement of dose distributions in the target volume. Particle radiation therapy using fast neutrons and protons is in under clinical trial in order to evaluate the role of dose distribution as well as biological effect in radiation therapy influencing upon local control of the tumor	
51	Focal brain lesions: effect of single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic findings on treatment decisions	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Brain Chemistry, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/cl [Classification], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Medical Records, Middle Aged	PURPOSE: To determine the influence of single-voxel proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic findings on the treatment of patients suspected of having a brain tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in 78 patients who underwent MR spectroscopy for evaluation of a focal brain mass suspected of being neoplastic. MR spectroscopic findings were positive for neoplasm in 49 patients and negative in 29. Treatment with or without performance of biopsy was noted. In patients with positive findings who underwent irradiation or chemotherapy without biopsy and in patients with negative findings who were treated medically or followed up for interval changes, MR spectroscopy was classified as having a potential positive influence on treatment. In patients with positive findings with subsequently proved nonneoplastic lesions and in patients with negative findings with subsequently proved tumors, MR spectroscopy was classified as having a potential negative influence. RESULTS: MR spectroscopy in eight (16%) patients with positive findings and in 15 (52%) patients with negative findings had a potential positive influence on treatment. In two (3%) patients, MR spectroscopy had a potential negative influence. CONCLUSION: MR spectroscopy may play a beneficial role in the management of suspected brain tumors. Prospective studies are needed to test the effect of MR spectroscopy on clinical practice and to measure costs and benefits

The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis. Charged particle radiotherapy can safely deliver high tumor doses to paraspinal tumors with good local control	
876	Heavy charged particles produce a bystander effect via cell-cell junctions. [Review] [21 refs]	Alpha Particles, Animals, Bystander Effect, Cell Communication/re [Radiation Effects], CHO Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Chromatids/re [Radiation Effects], Cricetinae, Cricetulus, DNA Damage, Gap Junctions/ph [Physiology], Humans, Hybrid Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Japan, Mutagenesis, Mutation, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiobiology/is [Instrumentation]	Radiation-induced damage to living cells results from either a direct hit to cellular DNA, or from indirect action which leads to DNA damage from radiation produced radicals. However, in recent years there is evidence that biological effects such as cell killing, mutation induction, chromosomal damage and modification of gene expression can occur in a cell population exposed to low doses of alpha particles. In fact these doses are so low that not all cells in the population will be hit directly by the radiation. Using a precision alpha-particle microbeam, it has been recently demonstrated that irradiated target cells can induce a bystander mutagenic response in neighboring "bystander" cells which were not directly hit by alpha particles. Furthermore, these results suggest that gap-junction mediated cell-to-cell communication plays a critical role in this bystander phenomenon. The purpose of this section is to describe recent studies on bystander biological effects. The recent work described here utilized heavy charged particles for irradiation, and investigated the role of gap-junction mediated cell-cell communication in this phenomenon. [References: 21]

In most cases a single dose of stereotactic irradiation effects the reduction of the tumor volume in a few days. External whole brain and, in two cases, spinal irradiation completed the treatment to avoid seeding of tumor cells. The technique and the advantages of this original therapeutical approach to intracranial germinomas are described and discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred seventeen eligible patients were randomly allocated to either photon or pion therapy. No adjuvant hormone therapy was used. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 42 months (range 2-90). Acute bladder toxicity was worse in the pion arm, p = 0.2, but other acute toxicity did not differ. Late grade 2 toxicity was significantly less in the pion arm (29% at 5 years versus 48%, p = 0.002), but late grade 3 or 4 toxicity did not differ. Clinical local control was not significantly different between treatment arms (64% after 5 years with photons, 56% with pions, p = 0.6). Cause-specific and overall survival also did not differ (p = 0.7). There was a significant delay in time to first failure in the photon arm, largely as a result of decreased biochemical relapse, p = 0.01. A multivariate analysis is presented. CONCLUSION: Pion therapy was well tolerated, with increased acute toxicity and significantly decreased late tissue injury. This contrasts with the late toxicity observed with higher LET particle therapy such as neutron therapy. No improvement in local control with pion therapy was observed

Each of these new therapy modalities requires several types of information before prescribing safely the doses to patients, as well as for recording and reporting the treatments: (i) absorbed dose measured in a homogeneous phantom in reference conditions; (ii) dose distribution computed at the level of the target volume(s) and the normal tissues at risk; (iii) radiation quality from which a RBE evaluation could be predicted and (iv) RBE measured on biological systems or derived from clinical observation. In hadron therapy, the RBE of the different beams raises specific problems. For fast neutrons, the RBE varies within wide limits (about 2 to 5) depending on the neutron energy spectrum, dose, and biological system. For protons, the RBE values range between smaller limits (about 1.0 to 1.2). A clinical benefit can thus not be expected from RBE differences. However, the proton RBE problem cannot be ignored since dose differences of about 5% can be detected clinically in some cases. The situation is most complex with heavy ions since RBE variations are at least as large as for fast neutrons, as a function of particle type and energy, dose and biological system. In addition, RBE varies with depth. Radiation quality thus has to be taken into account when prescribing and reporting a treatment. This can be done in different ways: (a) description of the method of beam production; (b) computed LET spectra and/or measured microdosimetric spectra at the points clinically relevant; (c) RBE determination. The most relevant RBE data are those obtained for late tolerance of normal tissues at 2 Gy per fraction ("reference RBE"). The "clinical RBE" selected by the radiation oncologist when prescribing the treatment will be close to the reference RBE, but other factors (such as heterogeneity in dose distribution) may influence the selection of the clinical RBE. Combination of microdosimetric data and experimental RBE values improves the confidence in both sets of data

In one case 1 year 9 months after irradiation repeated hemorrhage was noted, the malformation was removed by an open surgical method. Clinical convalescence after irradiation was observed in the other 4 patients without side-effects during a follow-up period of 1-3 yrs. Angiography after irradiation was not performed. Teleroentgenotherapy was regarded as a good alternative in the treatment ofinoperable arteriovenous brain malformations	
3734	Electron arc dose distributions as a function of beam energy	Canada, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Equipment Design, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Universities, Water	The characteristic angle-beta concept provides a simple semiempirical method for determination of dose distributions in electron arc therapy. Initially, the method required a set of measured radial depth dose distributions for each electron beam energy used for arc therapy. In this paper, we report an extension of the angle-beta concept that enables the determination of arc therapy depth doses for an arbitrary electron energy from the known set of depth dose data at a reference energy. Depth dose distributions of stationary and arc electron beams have been studied in the energy range from 9 to 18 MeV. The stationary electron beams used for electron arc therapy were collimated by photon collimators only, no secondary collimation was used in our experiments. For stationary electron beams and for arc electron beams with a given characteristic angle beta, the depths of dose maximum as well as the depths of a given percentage depth dose beyond the depth of dose maximum are linearly proportional to the mean incident electron energy. This simple geometrical and dosimetric relationship increases the potential usefulness of the angle-beta concept in clinical electron arc therapy

Xerostomia is a serious, permanent, and ubiquitous sequelae in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This study was designed to investigate the severity of xerostomia and its impact on the quality of life in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated by conventional radiation therapy in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, were surveyed by interview at the outpatient. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analysis of xerostomia and xerostomia-related problems. RESULTS: Of 136 patents, 73.5% of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. 82.4% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate speech; 92.6% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate chewing and swallowing; 91.2% of the patients changed their feeding pattern (can eat only mashed food); 61.3% of the patients had to wake up to drink water because of dry mouth; 75.0% of the patients had teeth deteriorated. CONCLUSION: 73.5% of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. Xerostomia has a significant impact on the patient's speech, deglutition, sleep, and increases the morbidity rate of the tooth

We discuss issues related to the statistical analysis of Monte Carlo dose calculations for realistic clinical beams using various variance reduction or time saving techniques. We discuss the effect of statistical uncertainties on dose prescription and monitor unit calculation for conventional treatment and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show the effect of statistical uncertainties on beamlet dose calculation and plan optimization for IMRT and other advanced treatment techniques such as modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT). We provide practical guidelines for the clinical implementation of Monte Carlo treatment planning and show realistic examples of Monte Carlo based IMRT and MERT plans

The leakage radiation in the patient plane and at the surface of the electron applicators has been measured for applicator sizes from 6 cm X 6 cm to 25 cm X 25 cm and beam energies from 6 to 22 MeV. For certain applicator/energy combinations the leakage radiation was significant. The leakage radiation, relative to the central axis dose, was found to be up to 7% in the patient plane and up to 39% at the applicator surface. Reducing the collimator setting or adding lead at select locations on the applicator surface was effective in reducing the magnitude of the radiation leakage

Larger peripheral angiomas are better treated with beta-ray brachytherapy resulting in improved results in terms of local tumor control and the side effects of treatment. Photodynamic treatment is an alternative option in the management of capillary hemangiomas of the retina. Further improvement of the treatment results of photodynamic therapy may be achieved by combination with intravitreal drugs. External beam radiation using either stereotactic techniques or proton radiation must be considered as experimental. The treatment of juxtapapillary angiomas is still a therapeutic dilemma. Vitreoretinal surgery should be confined to advanced stages with tractional detachment or when no other treatment option is available to salvage the eye. [References: 51]

In the literature 220 cases of sweat gland carcinomas have been presented over the last three decades. The medium age is 57 years, with an equal male-to-female distribution. Topographically, the tumor is located at the lower limbs (32.9%), the upper extremities (28%), and the head (26%). Involvement of the trunk is rare. Diagnosis can be complicated as the carcinoma is a rare entity, with no correlation of its histologic classification and biologic presentation. This can only implicate the difficulties in treatment

This is the first trial to investigate the utility of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the imaging of chordoma before and after carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with chordoma were investigated with MET-PET before and after CIRT and the findings analyzed visually and quantitatively. Tumor MET uptake was evaluated by tumor-to-nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). RESULTS: In 12 (80%) patients chordoma was clearly visible in the baseline MET-PET study with a mean T/N ratio of 3.3+/-1.7. The MET uptake decreased significantly to 2.3+/-1.4 after CIRT ( P<0.05). A significant reduction in tumor MET uptake of 24% was observed after CIRT. Fourteen (93%) patients showed no local recurrence after CIRT with a median follow-up time of 20 months. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that MET-PET is feasible for imaging of chordoma. MET-PET could provide important tumor metabolic information for the therapeutic monitoring of chordoma after CIRT

To establish heavy ion therapy for prostate cancer, three trials have been conducted. For 247 patients with T1b-T3 cancer, carbon ion beam was irradiated 20 times/5 weeks with or without endocrine therapy. Overall and cause-specific survivals were excellent and local control was achieved in all patients except one. Grade 3 late morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra was developed in 7 cases who received higher dose. Thus, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment. In conclusion, carbon ion therapy is expected to exert excellent effect in the treatment of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. [References: 19]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 125 patients who underwent proton therapy between July 2003 and December 2004. Of these 125 patients, 11 had head and neck malignancies, 15 non-small cell lung cancers, 22 hepatocellular carcinomas, 62 prostate cancers, and 15 other malignant tumors. RESULTS: Most patients experienced Grade 0-1 acute morbidities (NCI-CTC) in skin or mucosa, while a temporary Grade 2-3 reaction was observed in a high dose area. Response rates were 73% for H & N malignancies, 100% for NSCLC, and 77% for HCC. PSA evaluation for patients with prostate cancer revealed a high rate of complete response. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of proton therapy at Shizuoka Cancer Center was demonstrated for patients with early-stage cancer or locally advanced disease	
2124	Four-dimensional treatment planning and fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy for moving tumor	Computer Systems, Feasibility Studies, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Humans, Japan, Movement, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: To achieve precise three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy for mobile tumors, a new radiotherapy system and its treatment planning system were developed and used for clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors	
75	Linear accelerator output variations and their consequences for megavoltage imaging	Calibration, Equipment Design, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	An experimental study of radiation output intensity fluctuations of a Philips SL25 linear accelerator is presented. Measurements are obtained using an electronic portal imaging device, and the consequences of the measured fluctuations for various different applications of megavoltage imaging including portal imaging, transit dosimetry and megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) are discussed with examples. Fluctuations in output of +/- 0.7% (1 SD) are seen on every radiation pulse after photon noise and uncertainties caused by the detection system have been accounted for. Large fluctuations are also seen during the initial beam stabilization period (15%), during normal accelerator operation after the beam has been on for more than 1 min (4.5%) and during are therapy as a repeatable function of gantry angle (9%). Such output intensity fluctuations are shown to produce image artifacts in portal imaging devices with scanned detector readout and can also produce systematic errors in detector calibration that would lead to uncertainty in transit dose calculations. The propagation of these intensity fluctuations through MVCT image reconstruction is shown to produce ring artifacts in the reconstructed image. Sample portal and MVCT images are presented. All observed fluctuations in accelerator output are well within the manufacturer's specifications and do not affect the total dose delivered during normal treatment. Finally, megavoltage imaging is shown to be a powerful tool for accelerator quality assurance and treatment verification

Over the past twelve months at this institution, we have developed devices and techniques to obtain precise and reproducible electron therapy treatments. These devices and methods have been used in the treatment of irregularly shaped fields for areas of complex shape, or those adjacent to critical or radiosensitive tissues and areas where it has been cosmetically unsuitable for patients to carry treatment field markings. This paper describes the techniques used in six representative cases with due consideration to physics, dosimetry and practical aspects. Several recommendations result from our experiences here

After intratumoral application in s.c. tumors expressing mutant E-cadherin, the 213Bi-labeled antibody was specifically retained at the injection site as shown by autoradiography. After injection into the peritoneal cavity, uptake in small i.p. tumor nodules expressing mutant E-cadherin was 17-fold higher than in tumor nodules expressing wild-type E-cadherin (62% injected dose/g versus 3.7% injected dose/g). 78% of the total activity in the ascites fluid was bound to free tumor cells expressing mutant E-cadherin, whereas in control cells, binding was only 18%. The selective binding of the 213Bi-labeled, mutation-specific monoclonal antibody E-cadherin delta 9-1 suggests that it will be successful for alpha-radioimmunotherapy of disseminated tumors after locoregional application

[French]	Biopsy, Brachytherapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: We conducted a retrospective study on the clinical factors influencing the local and general prognosis of patients treated for uveal melanoma with a preliminary analysis of the prognostic value of monosomy 3. PATIENTS: and method: The patients sent to Curie Institute for uveal melanoma have a complete initial clinical evaluation, conservative management by radiotherapy or enucleation, and local and general long-term follow-up. Over the last 5 years, the status of chromosome 3 has been assessed by FISH in the tumors of enucleated patients. Findings concerning the initial workup, treatment, and follow-up are recorded prospectively. We conducted a retrospective study with multivariate analysis of the clinical factors influencing local recurrence, ocular conservation metastasis, and survival and studied the effect of monosomy 3. RESULTS: A total of 2241 patients were registered with a median follow-up of 72 months. Of these patients, 92.8% had conservative management with iodine 125 brachytherapy or proton beam therapy and 7.2% of the patients had enucleation (n=160). Tumors from 120 patients were studied for the status of chromosome 3 by FISH. The overall survival rate was 76.3% and the metastatic rate was 19.5%. The clinical factors influencing survival were the size and location of the tumor, age of the patient, gender, and initial treatment. The factors influencing the metastatic risk were the same plus retinal detachment and local recurrence. Monosomy 3 was a significant risk factor for metastatic disease. DISCUSSION: This study found the usual risk factors with the difference that location on the equator seems to be of worse prognosis than ciliary body involvement for survival and metastasis. In addition, the initial retinal detachment appears to be a risk factor for local recurrence and metastasis. At present, the evaluation of chromosome 3 is available for enucleated tumors but it could probably be done on needle biopsy performed during conservative management as well. CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous results on the prognostic factors of uveal melanoma and on the value of monosomy 3. The increasingly precise identification of a group of high-risk patients should allow us to propose adjuvant therapy and to adapt follow-up

Left ventricular myocardium of victims of accidents without cardiovascular pathology was studied as control. Compared with control dysbalance of various degree was noted in left ventricular myocardium of patients with ischemic heart disease. Four groups of microelements were distinguished: lowered content (Se, Rb, K); close to normal content (Mn, Cu); moderately elevated content (Cr, Sr, Fe); elevated content (Ni, Zn). Several orders of magnitude elevation of Ni and Zn was noted in all parts of left ventricle, especially in the zone of infarction and periinfarction zone	
2966	Effect of head phantom size on 10B and 1H[n,gamma]2H dose distributions for a broad field accelerator epithermal neutron source for BNCT	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Engineering, Head, Humans, Models,Structural, Monte Carlo Method, Neutron Capture Therapy, Ohio, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Skin, Time, Universities, Water	The effect of head phantom size on the 10B and 1H[n,gamma]2H dose distributions for a broad epithermal neutron radiation field generated by an accelerator-based epithermal neutron source for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) have been studied. Also two techniques for calculating the absorbed gamma dose from a measured gamma-ray source distribution are compared: a Monte Carlo technique, which is well accepted in the BNCT community, and a Point Kernel technique. The count-rate distribution in the central plane of three rectangular parallelopiped head water phantoms irradiated with an epithermal neutron field was measured with a boron trifluoride (BF3) detector. This epithermal neutron field was produced at the Ohio State University Van de Graaff Accelerator Facility. The 10B absorbed dose and the gamma-ray source have the same distribution in the head phantom as the BF3 count-rate distribution. The absorbed gamma dose from the measured source distribution was calculated using MCNP, a Monte Carlo code, and QAD-CGGP, a Point Kernel code. The most pronounced effect of phantom size on 10B absorbed dose was on the dose rate at the depth of maximum dose, dmax. An increase in dose rate at dmax was observed with a decrease in phantom size, the dose rate in the smallest phantom being larger by a factor of 1.4 than the dose rate in the largest phantom. Also, dmax for the phantoms shifted deeper with a decrease in phantom dimensions. The shift between the largest and the smallest phantoms was 6 mm. Finally, the smaller phantoms had lower entrance 10B dose as a percent of the dose at dmax, or better skin sparing. Our calculations for the gamma dose show that a Point Kernel technique can be used to calculate the dose distribution as accurately as a Monte Carlo technique, in much shorter computation times	
2976	[Modern technics of irradiation of brain tumors in children]. [Review] [48 refs] [French]	Brachytherapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Stem, Child, Electrons, France, Humans, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], X-Rays	Radiotherapy still represents with surgery the cornerstone in the management of pediatric brain tumors. Techniques of irradiation have benefited greatly from modern imaging, CT scan and MRI for tumor-volume delineation, as well as megavoltage equipment, mainly linear accelerators delivering both high-energy X-Rays and electrons, widely used in cranial-spinal irradiations. Furthermore, new modalities of doses and volumes have been tested in various tumors (medulloblastomas, germ cell tumors...), in studies frequently combining chemotherapy with conventional therapies. Nevertheless, local control remains a major concern in tumors such as brain stem and high grade supratentorial gliomas. Concerning iatrogenic neurological sequelae, particularly harmful in children, limited data suggest an improvement in recent years. This improvement is partly due to the reduced prophylactic doses for the treatment of medulloblastomas, but further long-term observations are necessary. For these reasons, multiple technical innovations have been investigated. Some of them concern irradiation selectivity: stereotactic pencil beams, interstitial brachytherapy, heavy charged particles, 3-dimensional treatment planning. Others aim to increase the irradiation "efficacy": multifractionation, high LET particles, radiation-sensitizers. [References: 48]

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with medication refractory idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia were treated with a single fraction of 80 Gy to the trigeminal nerve root. For treatment delivery, a 4-mm collimator and a 7-arc technique were delivered using a stereotactic floor stand system with an isocenter stability of 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm to minimize dose to the brainstem. Treatment delivery time was approximately 55 minutes. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 1-40 mo), 57% of patients achieved complete pain relief and 75% (exact 95% confidence interval, 55 to 89%) had their pain reduced to 3 or less on a 10-point pain scale. Median time to pain relief was 1 month. Four patients did not respond to treatment. The actuarial mean time to pain recurrence in responders was 14 months, and the actuarial mean response duration in major to complete responders was 16 months. Women had significantly longer mean time to pain recurrence than men (16 versus 7 months; P = 0.05). Three patients reported new mild facial numbness after radiosurgery and one patient developed neurotrophic keratopathy. CONCLUSION: Linear accelerator-based radiosurgery for medication refractory trigeminal neuralgia provides effective pain relief with a low complication rate

Protons, neutrons, pions, boron-neutron capture therapy, and charged-nuclei therapy (with argon, carbon, helium [alpha particles], neon, nitrogen, and silicon) have been assessed for their physical, biological, and clinical effects. In the 90 years since protons and neutrons were discovered, investigations of particle therapy for cancer have helped to elucidate many fundamental radiobiological ideas, such as linear energy transfer, relative biological effectiveness, oxygen effect, and oxygen enhancement. Particle therapy has contributed to our understanding of medical ethics when neutron therapy became intertwined with the debate over standards of informed consent in radiation experiments in humans during the cold war era. Particle teletherapy and brachytherapy continue to show promise in some clinical situations. In the future, the insights of molecular biology might clarify the ideal particles for clinical situations	
1841	Progress of the Proton-Ion Medical Machine Study (PIMMS)	Austria, Carbon, Equipment Design, Europe, Germany, Humans, Ions, Italy, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Research, Switzerland, Synchrotrons	The Proton-Ion Medical Machine Study (PIMMS) was set up following an agreement between Professor M. Regler of the Med-AUSTRON (Austria) and Professor U. Amaldi of the TERA Foundation (Italy) to join their efforts in the design of a medical synchrotron that could later be adapted to individual national needs. CERN agreed to host this study inside its PS Division and to contribute one full-time member to the study team. The study group has worked in collaboration with GSI (Germany) and was more recently joined by Onkologie 2000 (Czech Republic). Work started in January 1996 and is expected to finish during 1998. The agreed aim of the study was to investigate and design a generic facility that would allow the direct clinical comparison of protons and carbon ions for cancer treatment. The accelerator was to be designed primarily for high-precision active beam scanning with both protons and ions, but was also to be capable of delivering proton beams with passive spreading	
4473	Characterization of cytochrome c variants with high-resolution FTICR mass spectrometry: correlation of fragmentation and structure	Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cyclotrons, Cytochrome c Group/an [Analysis], Fourier Analysis, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Humans, Ions, Isoenzymes/an [Analysis], Mass Spectrometry, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptide Fragments/an [Analysis], Protein Conformation, Research, Science, Washington	The dissociation of cytochrome c ions (15+ charge state) generated by electrospray ionization has been studied by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR) using a sustained off-resonance irradiation/collision-induced dissociation (SORI-CID) technique. Over 95% of the fragment ions can be accurately assigned (to better than 10 ppm), yielding information on the primary sequences of the various proteins. Up to four stages of mass spectrometry (MS4) have been achieved without the need for quadrupole excitation/collisional cooling of the product ions. The subtle structural differences among the cytochrome c variants (from bovine, tuna, rabbit, and horse) are clearly reflected in their fragmentation patterns: replacing 3 out of 104 residues of the cytochrome c is shown to dramatically change the dissociation pattern. Of particular importance are a variety of results indicating that the dissociation of the cytochrome c's is influenced by higher-order structure and charge location, in addition to the primary structure (i.e., sequence). No fragmentation is observed in the region between residues 10-20 and little dissociation between residues 70-90. This is most likely due to the interactions of the heme group with the polypeptide chain, and such a heme "footprinting" pattern is analogous to the protein conformation in solution. These studies demonstrate that electrospray ionization-FTICR using SORI-CID can be a useful tool to probe not only the small differences in the primary sequences of proteins but also suggest the potential for probing their higher-order structures and yielding information not readily available from H/D exchange or circular dichoism studies

Although some conversion methods have already been proposed, it is hard to check the conversion accuracy during practical therapy. We have estimated the CT numbers of real tissues by a calculational method established by Mustafa and Jackson. The relationship between the CT numbers and the electron densities was investigated for various body tissues as well as some tissue-equivalent materials used for a conversion to check the accuracy of the current conversion methods. The result indicates a slight disagreement at the high-CT-number region. A precise estimation of the multiple scattering, nuclear reaction and range straggling of incident particles has been considered as being important to realize higher-level conformal therapy in the future. The relationship between these parameters and the CT numbers was also investigated for tissues and water. The result shows that it is sufficiently practical to replace these parameters for real tissues with those for water by adjusting the density

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity	
423	Optimizing 4D cone-beam CT acquisition protocol for external beam radiotherapy	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Tomography,Spiral Computed/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,Spiral Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: Four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D-CBCT) imaging is sensitive to parameters such as gantry rotation speed, number of gantry rotations, X-ray pulse rate, and tube current, as well as a patient's breathing pattern. The aim of this study is to optimize the image acquisition on a patient-specific basis while minimizing the scan time and the radiation dose. METHODS AND MATERIALS: More than 60 sets of 4D-CBCT images, each with a temporal resolution of 10 phases, were acquired using multiple-gantry rotation and slow-gantry rotation techniques. The image quality was quantified with a relative root mean-square error (RE) and correlated with various acquisition settings; specifically, varying gantry rotation speed, varying both the rotation speed and the number of rotations, and varying both the rotation speed and tube current to keep the radiation exposure constant. These experiments were repeated for three different respiratory periods. RESULTS: With similar radiation dose, 4D-CBCT images acquired with low current and low rotation speed have better quality over images obtained with high current and high rotation speed. In general, a one-rotation low-speed scan is superior to a two-rotation double-speed scan, even though they provide the same number of projections. Furthermore, it is found that the image quality behaves monotonically with the relative speed as defined by the gantry rotation speed and the patient respiratory period. CONCLUSIONS: The RE curves established in this work can be used to predict the 4D-CBCT image quality before a scan. This allows the acquisition protocol to be optimized individually to balance the desired quality with the associated scanning time and patient radiation dose

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred twenty patients with carcinoma of the cervix were treated by primary radiotherapy between 1991 and 1998. The median age was 63 (range 24-84). The distribution according to Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was as follows: Stage IB, 11.4%; IIA, 9.1%; IIB, 50.9%; IIIA, 3.6%; IIIB, 23.2%; and IVA, 1.8%. They were treated with whole pelvic irradiation giving 40 Gy to the midplane in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. This was followed by parametrial irradiation, giving 16-20 Gy in 8-10 fractions. HDR intracavitary brachytherapy was given weekly, with a dose of 7 Gy to point A for three fractions and, starting from 1996, 6 Gy weekly for four fractions. The median overall treatment time was 50 days (range 42-73 days). The median follow-up time was 4.7 years (range 3 months to 11.1 years). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The complete remission rate after radiotherapy was 93.4% (211/226). The 5-year actuarial failure-free survival (FFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates for stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA were 87.7% and 86.6%, 85% and 85%, 67.8% and 74%, 46.9% and 54.7%, 44.8% and 50.4%, 0% and 25%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, young age (< 50) (p = 0.0054), adenocarcinoma (p = 0.0384), and stage (p = 0.0005) were found to be independent poor prognostic factors. The 5-year actuarial major complication rates (Grade 3 or above) were as follows: proctitis, 1.0%; cystitis, 0.5%; enteritis, 1.3%; and overall, 2.8%. On multivariate analysis, history of pelvic surgery was a significant prognosticator. The two HDR fractionation schedules were not a significant prognosticator in predicting disease control and complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience in treating cervical cancer with HDR intracavitary brachytherapy is encouraging. Our treatment results and complication rates were compatible with those of the LDR series. Further studies are eagerly awaited to better define the optimal fractionation schedule for HDR brachytherapy and the schedule on how chemotherapy may be combined with it. [References: 41]

Neutrons are generated in both the linac head and the phantom. This study includes (a) field size effects, (b) off-axis dose profiles, (c) neutron contribution from the linac head, (d) dose contribution from capture gamma rays, (e) phantom heterogeneity effects, and (f) effects of primary electron energy shift. Results are presented in terms of absolute dose distributions and also in terms of DER (dose equivalent ratio). The DER is the maximum dose from the particle (neutron, proton, or alpha) divided by the maximum photon dose, multiplied by the particle quality factor and the modulation scaling factor. The total DER including neutrons, protons, and alphas is about 0.66 cSv/Gy for the Siemens 18 MV beam (10 cm x 10 cm). The neutron DER decreases with decreasing field size while the proton (or alpha) DER does not vary significantly except for the 1 cm x 1 cm field. Both Varian beams (15 and 18 MV) produce more neutrons, protons, and alphas particles than the Siemens 18 MV beam. This is mainly due to their higher primary electron energies: 15 and 18.3 MeV, respectively, vs 14 MeV for the Siemens 18 MV beam. For all beams, neutrons contribute more than 75% of the total DER, except for the 1 cm x 1 cm field (approximately 50%). The total DER is 1.52 and 2.86 cSv/Gy for the 15 and 18 MV Varian beams (10 cm x 10 cm), respectively. Media with relatively high-Z elements like bone may increase the dose from heavy charged particles by a factor 4. The total DER is sensitive to primary electron energy shift. A Siemens 18 MV beam with 15 MeV (instead of 14 MeV) primary electrons would increase by 40% the neutron DER and by 210% the proton + alpha DER. Comparisons with measurements (neutron yields from different materials and neutron dose equivalent) are also presented. Using the NCRP risk assessment method, we found that the dose equivalent from leakage neutrons (at 50-cm off-axis distance) represent 1.1, 1.1, and 2.0% likelihood of fatal secondary cancer for a 70 Gy treatment delivered by the Siemens 18 MV, Varian 15 MV, and Varian 18 MV beams, respectively	
780	Dosimetric verification of IMRT treatment planning using Monte Carlo simulations for prostate cancer	Computer Simulation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Femur/pa [Pathology], Humans, Male, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Software	The purpose of this work is to investigate the accuracy of dose calculation of a commercial treatment planning system (Corvus, Normos Corp., Sewickley, PA). In this study, 30 prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans from the commercial treatment planning system were recalculated using the Monte Carlo method. Dose-volume histograms and isodose distributions were compared. Other quantities such as minimum dose to the target (D(min)), the dose received by 98% of the target volume (D98), dose at the isocentre (D(iso)), mean target dose (D(mean)) and the maximum critical structure dose (D(max)) were also evaluated based on our clinical criteria. For coplanar plans, the dose differences between Monte Carlo and the commercial treatment planning system with and without heterogeneity correction were not significant. The differences in the isocentre dose between the commercial treatment planning system and Monte Carlo simulations were less than 3% for all coplanar cases. The differences on D98 were less than 2% on average. The differences in the mean dose to the target between the commercial system and Monte Carlo results were within 3%. The differences in the maximum bladder dose were within 3% for most cases. The maximum dose differences for the rectum were less than 4% for all the cases. For non-coplanar plans, the difference in the minimum target dose between the treatment planning system and Monte Carlo calculations was up to 9% if the heterogeneity correction was not applied in Corvus. This was caused by the excessive attenuation of the non-coplanar beams by the femurs. When the heterogeneity correction was applied in Corvus, the differences were reduced significantly. These results suggest that heterogeneity correction should be used in dose calculation for prostate cancer with non-coplanar beam arrangements	
459	Determination of the recombination correction factor kS for some specific plane-parallel and cylindrical ionization chambers in pulsed photon and electron beams	Biophysics/mt [Methods], Electrons, Germany, Humans, Ions, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy	It has been shown from an evaluation of the inverse reading of the dosemeter (1/M) against the inverse of the polarizing voltage (1/V), obtained with a number of commercially available ionization chambers, using dose per pulse values between 0.16 and 5 mGy, that a linear relationship between the recombination correction factor kS and dose per pulse (DPP) can be found. At dose per pulse values above 1 mGy the method of a general equation with coefficients dependent on the chamber type gives more accurate results than the Boag method. This method was already proposed by Burns and McEwen (1998, Phys. Med. Biol. 43 2033) and avoids comprehensive and time-consuming measurements of Jaffe plots which are a prerequisite for the application of the multi-voltage analysis (MVA) or the two-voltage analysis (TVA). We evaluated and verified the response of ionization chambers on the recombination effect in pulsed accelerator beams for both photons and electrons. Our main conclusions are: (1) The correction factor k(S) depends only on the DPP and the chamber type. There is no influence of radiation type and energy. (2) For all the chambers investigated there is a linear relationship between kS and DPP up to 5 mGy/pulse, and for two chambers we could show linearity up to 40 mGy/pulse. (3) A general formalism, such as that of Boag, characterizes chambers exclusively by the distance of the electrodes and gives a trend for the correction factor, and therefore (4) a general formalism has to reflect the influence of the chamber construction on the recombination by the introduction of chamber-type dependent coefficients	
1753	Quality of life, health outcomes, and identity for patients with prostate cancer in five different treatment groups	Aged, Gender Identity, Health Status, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Oncologic Nursing, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/nu [Nursing], Prostatic Neoplasms/px [Psychology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Quality of Life, Questionnaires, Radiation, Research, Treatment Outcome, United States, Universities	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe how different treatments for prostate cancer affect health-related quality of life (QOL), health status, and masculinity. DESIGN: Longitudinal survey design with descriptive, correlational, and comparative elements. SETTING: A tertiary medical center and associated clinics in a suburban community in the Southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 185 men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled from five treatment groups: watchful waiting (n = 30), surgery (n = 59), conventional radiation (n = 25), proton-beam radiation (n = 24), and a combination of conventional radiation and proton-beam radiation or mixed-beam radiation (n = 47). At six months, 163 remained on the study; at 12 months, 154 remained: and at 18 months, 153 remained. The average age was 68 years, and 82% of the men were white. METHODS: Men were enrolled at treatment and given a questionnaire with a self-addressed, stamped envelope for return. Questionnaires were mailed again at 6, 12, and 18 months. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Health-related QOL health status, prostate treatment-specific symptoms, and sex-role identity. FINDINGS: No overall difference in health-related QOL or health status was found, but post-hoc analysis revealed specific differences. The differences existed in sexual functioning and gastrointestinal treatment-specific symptoms. No relationship existed between masculinity and health-related QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related QOL and health status are similar regardless of type of treatment. Radiation tends to produce more gastrointestinal symptoms, and surgery tends to produce more sexual functioning symptoms. Watchful waiting is associated with poorer general health. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses can provide specific treatment-related information to men who are faced with making treatment decisions for prostate cancer and, in consultation with the healthcare team, can select a treatment best sulted to them	
4338	Hypopharyngeal cancer: results of treatment with radiotherapy alone and combinations of surgery and radiotherapy	Combined Modality Therapy, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Hypopharynx/su [Surgery], Laryngectomy, Neoplasm Metastasis, Pharyngeal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Postoperative Complications, Postoperative Complications/et [Etiology], Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Survival	From 1962 to 1977, 90 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer were seen in the Academic Hospital in Leuven. Radiotherapy was the primary treatment in 66 patients, actuarial survival was 18% at 5 years and local control 22%. In 22 patients treated with a laryngopharyngectomy and pre- or postoperative radiotherapy, survival was also 18%, but local control was obtained in 51%. No differences in prognosis were demonstrated according to the tumoral stage or nodal status. Metastases were found in 10.5% of irradiated patients and in 14% of patients treated with combined therapy. The frequency of postoperative complications was not increased after surgery for preoperatively irradiated patients. Treatment results in hypopharyngeal cancer remain unfavorable, even with a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Alternative approaches should be actively investigated to improve local control rates such as the modalities currently under study (high LET, new fractionations, combinations with drugs)

444	Consequences of leaf calibration errors on IMRT delivery	Artifacts, Calibration, Dose Fractionation, Film Dosimetry/mt [Methods], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Netherlands, Norway, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Reproducibility of Results, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity	IMRT treatments using multi-leaf collimators may involve a large number of segments in order to spare the organs at risk. When a large proportion of these segments are small, leaf positioning errors may become relevant and have therapeutic consequences. The performance of four head and neck IMRT treatments under eight different cases of leaf positioning errors has been studied. Systematic leaf pair offset errors in the range of +/-2.0 mm were introduced, thus modifying the segment sizes of the original IMRT plans. Thirty-six films were irradiated with the original and modified segments. The dose difference and the gamma index (with 2%/2 mm criteria) were used for evaluating the discrepancies between the irradiated films. The median dose differences were linearly related to the simulated leaf pair errors. In the worst case, a 2.0 mm error generated a median dose difference of 1.5%. Following the gamma analysis, two out of the 32 modified plans were not acceptable. In conclusion, small systematic leaf bank positioning errors have a measurable impact on the delivered dose and may have consequences for the therapeutic outcome of IMRT

3972	Extension of a numerical algorithm to proton dose calculations. I. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations	Algorithms, Biophysics, Canada, Computer Simulation, Humans, Methods, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Physics, Poisson Distribution, Probability, Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy	A numerical algorithm originally developed for electron dose calculations [Med. Phys. 21, 1591 (1994)] has been modified for use with proton beams. The algorithm recursively propagates the proton distribution in energy, angle, and space from one level in an absorbing medium to another at slightly greater depth until all protons stop. Vavilov's theory is used to predict, at any point in the absorber, the broadening of the primary proton energy-spectrum. Moliere's theory is applied to describe the angular distribution, and it is shown that the Gaussian first term of Moliere's series expansion is of sufficient accuracy for dose calculations. These multiple scattering and energy loss distributions are sampled using equal probability spacing to optimize computational speed while maintaining calculational accuracy. Inelastic nuclear collisions along the proton trajectories are modeled by a simple exponential extinction. Predictions of the algorithm for absolute dose deposition by a 160 MeV initially monoenergetic proton beam are compared with the results of Monte Carlo simulations performed with the PTRAN code. The excellent level of agreement between the results of these two methods of dose calculation (< 5% dose and < 3 mm spatial deviations) demonstrate that dose deposition from proton beams may be computed to high accuracy using this algorithm without the need for extensive empirical measurement as input

763	Stereotactic proton beam therapy for intracranial arteriovenous malformations	Adolescent, Adult, Child, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies	PURPOSE: To investigate hypofractionated stereotactic proton therapy of predominantly large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by analyzing retrospectively the results from a cohort of patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, a total of 85 patients with vascular lesions have been treated. Of those, 64 patients fulfilled the criteria of having an arteriovenous malformation and sufficient follow-up. The AVMs were grouped by volume: <14 cc (26 patients) and > or =14 cc (38 patients). Treatment was delivered with a fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton beam under stereotactic conditions, using a stereophotogrammetric positioning system. The majority of patients were hypofractionated (2 or 3 fractions), and the proton doses are presented as single-fraction equivalent cobalt Gray equivalent doses (SFEcGyE). The overall mean minimum target volume dose was 17.37 SFEcGyE, ranging from 10.38-22.05 SFEcGyE. RESULTS: Analysis by volume group showed obliteration in 67% for volumes <14 cc and 43% for volumes > or =14 cc. Grade IV acute complications were observed in 3% of patients. Transient delayed effects were seen in 15 patients (23%), becoming permanent in 3 patients. One patient also developed a cyst 8 years after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic proton beam therapy applied in a hypofractionated schedule allows for the safe treatment of large AVMs, with acceptable results. It is an alternative to other treatment strategies for large AVMs. AVMs are likely not static entities, but probably undergo vascular remodeling. Factors influencing angiogenesis could play a new role in a form of adjuvant therapy to improve on the radiosurgical results	
1122	Noninvasive linear accelerator radiosurgery as the primary treatment for trigeminal neuralgia	Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Treatment Outcome, Trigeminal Neuralgia/su [Surgery]	The application of a dedicated linear accelerator (DLINAC) as a noninvasive surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia has not yet been demonstrated. This work evaluates the outcome and indications of 22 patients submitted to DLINAC radiosurgery as a primary treatment for essential trigeminal neuralgia. At last follow-up evaluation, 21 patients (95.5%) had sustained significant pain relief. DLINAC radiosurgery is safe and effective as a primary noninvasive surgical treatment for selected patients with essential trigeminal neuralgia	
3426	In vitro induction of chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes, with and without boron 10, by radiations concerned in boron neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Interphase, Isotopes, Lead, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Mitosis, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Nitrogen, Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness	A beam consisting of mainly 24 keV neutrons has been constructed for radiobiological studies to evaluate the potential of these particles for treating deep tumours by the boron capture reaction. The induction of chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro was examined and a linear dose effect with a relative biological effectiveness similar to fission neutrons was obtained. For samples placed at depths in a plastic phantom the aberration yields declined with depth at a rate matching the fall in the sum of dose due to proton recoils and neutron capture in nitrogen 14. The presence of boron 10 at 30 micrograms ml-1 did not affect the aberration yield. By using the mixed sample method, the probability of interphase death or mitotic delay in cells crossed by an alpha particle or lithium-7 ion produced in the boron capture reaction was shown to be close to 1.0. Thus these cells are prevented from coming to mitosis in culture. The implications for boron capture therapy are that this filtered beam has a "high LET" effect which could lead to poor normal tissue sparing. However there may be a significant therapeutic advantage due to a high probability of killing tumour cells that have incorporated boron 10	
1331	Tumor location, cirrhosis, and surgical history contribute to tumor movement in the liver, as measured during stereotactic irradiation using a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system	Computer Systems, Fluoroscopy, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Hepatectomy, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Liver Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) intrafractional motion of liver tumors during real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 20 patients with liver tumors were analyzed. Before treatment, a 2-mm gold marker was implanted near the tumor. The RTRT system used fluoroscopy image processor units to determine the 3D position of the implanted marker. A linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker was located within a permitted region. The automatically recorded tumor-motion data were analyzed to determine the amplitude of the tumor motion, curve shape of the tumor motion, treatment efficiency, frequency of movement, and hysteresis. Each of the following clinical factors was evaluated to determine its contribution to the amplitude of movement: tumor position, existence of cirrhosis, surgical history, tumor volume, and distance between the isocenter and the marker. RESULTS: The average amplitude of tumor motion in the 20 patients was 4 +/- 4 mm (range 1-12), 9 +/- 5 mm (range 2-19), and 5 +/- 3 mm (range 2-12) in the left-right, craniocaudal, and anterior-posterior (AP) direction, respectively. The tumor motion of the right lobe was significantly larger than that of the left lobe in the left-right and AP directions (p = 0.01). The tumor motion of the patients with liver cirrhosis was significantly larger than that of the patients without liver cirrhosis in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.004). The tumor motion of the patients who had received partial hepatectomy was significantly smaller than that of the patients who had no history of any operation on the liver in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.03). Thus, three of the five clinical factors examined (i.e., tumor position in the liver, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver) significantly affected the tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction during stereotactic irradiation. Frequency analysis revealed that for 9 (45%) of the 20 tumors, the cardiac beat caused measurable motion. The 3D trajectory of the tumor showed hysteresis for 4 (20%) of the 20 tumors. The average treatment efficiency of RTRT was 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver all had an impact on the intrafractional tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction. This finding should be helpful in determining the smallest possible margin in individual cases of radiotherapy for liver malignancy	
2498	Future directions in the therapy for large bowel cancer	Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Breast, Colon, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy,Combination, Energy Transfer, Heavy Ions, Humans, Immunotherapy, Interferons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Intestinal Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Intestinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Intestinal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphoma, Mice, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Research, X-Ray Therapy	The essence of clinical research success is a blending of modality-oriented development and disease oriented strategy. Development therapeutics begins with single institution pilot, or exploratory, studies in which the treatment itself is more important than the strategic approach to the disease(s) being treated. Ultimately, if the exploratory studies are encouraging, the confirmatory and explanatory studies (Phase II--III) which follow will be disease oriented. Advances in the treatment of colorectal cancer will, it is hoped, come from new developmental therapeutics in chemotherapy, radiation therapy and biologic response modifier therapy. Developments in chemotherapy involve a steady stream of new drugs which are entering clinical trial from the drug development program of the NCI as well as from the pharmaceutical industry. These drugs include new structures and analogues of structures known to be active in some tumor types. In the latter category particular emphasis is being placed on new anthracycline analogues of doxorubicin and analogues of cisplatinum diammine dichloride. Recognizing the importance of colorectal cancer experimental models for this tumor are being given prominence in the prediction for now active drugs. These include transpantable rodent colon tumors and human colon tumors grown in nude mice or in a subrenal capsule system. In addition, the clonogenic assay of human tumor stem cells is under active investigation. It is hoped that this assay will be able to help predict which patients with colorectal tumors will respond to the given available drugs, and help predict the selection of new active drugs for colorectal cancer. Examples of new developments in radiation oncology which may have eventual impact on large bowel cancer include: (1) high linear energy transfer deliverence techniques such as neutrons, heavy ions and pi-mesons; (2) radiation sensitizers such as misonidazole, desmethylmisonidazole and newer electronic affinic compounds; (3) radiation protectors such as WR-2727; and (4) new fractionation schedules. In addition hyperthermia is evolving as a viable approach to killing neoplastic cells both alone and in conjunction with x-ray therapy. The biologic response modifiers (BRM) are a new and exciting development in cancer treatment. These are materials which hopefully will modify the hosts ability to react to neoplastic cells in a way which will be of therapeutic benefit either by itself or in conjunction with other therapies. Among BRMs of current interest are the interferons and thymic hormones. The interferons have demonstrated some ability to shrink clinically evident breast cancers and lymphomas and when supplies permit studies in bowel cancer will be great interest	
3497	[The effect of irradiation by a He-Ne laser and phytohemagglutinin on lymphocyte mitochondria]. [Russian]	Helium, Humans, Lasers, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/de [Drug Effects], Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Male, Microscopy,Electron, Mitochondria/de [Drug Effects], Mitochondria/re [Radiation Effects], Mitochondria/ul [Ultrastructure], Neon, Phytohemagglutinins/pd [Pharmacology], Radiation	Electron-microscopic morphometry has been applied to study mitochondria on ultrathin sections of lymphocytes from human peripheral blood. It has been shown that the stimulation of lymphocytes by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) 1 h causes increases in the quantity of mitochondria per cellular section (17%) as well as in the total area of mitochondria per cell section (35%), i.e. an increase in mitochondrial mass. Taking into account known facts about growth and division of mitochondria in late phases of cellular cycle, one can suppose that described above changes in mitochondria during G0----G1 transition under action of PHA belong to an early phase of biogenesis of mitochondria. In the contrary, irradiation of lymphocytes with He-Ne-laser (lambda = 632.8 nm) in dose 56 J/m2 which does not cause the G0----C1 transition, results in the increase in the number of mitochondria per cellular section (20%) but not increase in the total area of mitochondria per cell section. The last finding indicates to some modification of space configuration of the mitochondria without any changes in their mass. The increase in the quantity of mitochondria per cellular section after the irradiation could be related with the increase in electrochemical proton gradient and in phosphorylating activity of mitochondria. He-Ne-laser radiation as well as mitogen PHA cause some deaggregation of mitochondria (this is more pronounced in case of PHA) which may be related to their functional activation

In both cases two end points were taken, cell death and the induction of chromosome aberrations. The hamster cells were common stock V79 cells; the human ones were freshly derived from fetal material. For both types of cells, the survival curves could be described by straight lines in the conventional exponential plot, with values of D(o) of 0.78 and 0.37 Gy for the hamster and human cells, respectively. The rate of induction of chromosome aberrations could also be described by straight lines with slopes of 0.30 and 0.62 aberration per cell per gray. Thus, for this second end point also, it appears that human cells are twice as sensitive to the effects of alpha-particle irradiation as hamster cells	
2524	A Monte Carlo study of accelerator head scatter	Air, Electrons, Energy Transfer, Head, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Universities, X-Rays	The production of off-focus x rays in the head of a 6 MV linac has been investigated using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code. The purpose of the study was to identify the sources of off-focus radiation and the relative contribution for each source. Even though a particular energy and linac were modeled, the broad conclusions are expected to be general since the effects of head scatter are similar for most conventional head designs, regardless of manufacturer, energy, and model. The head components that were modeled include the exit window of the accelerating structure, target, beam stopper, flattening filter, monitor chamber, primary and secondary collimators, and air. Monoenergetic 6 MeV electrons were followed through the exit window, target, and beam stopper until all energy was expended. Primary- and higher-order x rays produced throughout the head were followed until they were either absorbed or passed through a plane at the isocenter. Sites of off-focus radiation were found to be diffusely distributed throughout the head, with the most intense sources being the primary collimator, flattening filter, and beam stopper. Data analysis shows that the collimator effect is determined primarily by the volume of the extended head-scatter source that is exposed to the point of measurement through the collimating system. The results of this study provide a rationale for developing extended source models to calculate the collimator factor for fields defined by arbitrary collimation. An additional advantage is an improvement in the agreement between measured and calculated isodose distributions

This technique involves making narrow beam attenuation measurements with a pair of ionization chambers and an iterative fitting program to analyze the data. A method is also described for determining the first-guess neutron spectrum for input into the iterative program. The results of the analysis yield spectra suitable for use in dose calculation algorithms and dosimetry protocols. Presented here is the first-known published photon spectrum from a clinical machine

Further measurements were made with a copper filter designed to reduce secondary electrons emitted by photon interactions with the Lucite tray. The results are discussed in relation to skin-sparing for radiation therapy patients. The measurements were made with a fixed volume PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber and corrected to zero-chamber volume. The results were found to be consistent with similar measurements taken with a variable volume extrapolation chamber	
2514	Experience in charged particle irradiation of tumors of the skull base: 1977-1992.[see comment]. [Review] [35 refs]	Adenocarcinoma, California, Californium, Female, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Ions, Male, Methods, Neon, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Sarcoma, Skull, Skull Base, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Universities	PURPOSE: To review the experience at University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in using charged particles to irradiate primary neoplasms of the skull base and those extending to the skull base from the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses. METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the period from 1977 to 1992, 223 patients were irradiated with charged particles at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for tumors either arising in or extending to the skull base, of whom 48 (22%) had recurrent lesions, either post previous surgery or radiotherapy. One hundred twenty-six patients had lesions arising in the cranial base, mostly chordoma (53), chondrosarcoma (27), paraclival meningioma (27) with 19 patients having other histologies such as osteosarcoma or neurofibrosarcoma. There were also 31 patients with primary or recurrent squamous carcinoma of the nasopharynx extending to the skull base, 44 patients with major or minor salivary gland tumors, mostly adenocarcinoma, and 22 patients with squamous carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses, all with cranial base extension. RESULTS: Local control and survival appeared improved in tumors arising in the skull base, following the ability with charged particles to deliver high doses (mean of 65 Gy-equivalent) with relative sparing of the adjacent normal tissues. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year local control was 85% for meningioma, 78% for chondrosarcoma, 63% for chordoma and 58% for other sarcoma. Follow-up ranged from 4-191 months with a median of 51 months. CONCLUSION: Charged particle radiotherapy is highly effective in controlling cranial base lesions which have have been partially resected. Better tumor localization with CT and MRI, improved 3-D treatment planning and beam delivery techniques have continued to reduce the level of serious complications and increase local control and survival.

The tumour dose ranged between 6 and 12 Gy and was limited by the low dose penetration of the neutron beam. A local control rate of 66% was obtained. The local control was affected by the tumour differentiation, residual status and histological subtype. Severe fibrosis of the subcutaneous tissues occurred in 40% usually after 2 years. No serious general side effects occurred. To optimize neutron therapy, a high energy clinically-based cyclotron with a fully rotational gantry and a multileaf collimator should be utilized. It seems that patients with locally advanced and well differentiated sarcomas can benefit from this therapy	
3944	[Radiotherapeutic quality assurance in the Hodgkin's disease study HD4 supported by the BMFT (Bundesministerium fur Forschung und Technologie)]. [German]	Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Germany,West, Hodgkin Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Safety	In the German Hodgkin Study Group a radiotherapy assurance program is being carried out at the radiotherapeutic reference centre in Gottingen since April 1988: 74 patients were entered from 27 radiotherapeutic institutions. 18 of them participated in a quality assurance program and submitted the data of 29 patients: In 21 of the 29 patients the protocol was followed correctly. Physical aspects of quality control showed two major deviations from the protocol: one center used photon energies of more than 15 MVX without mould; another had a anterior-posterior loading of 3:1. The radiation oncology assessment detected six inadequate treatments: The safety margin was inappropriate in three of 26 mantle fields. Another center used a multiple field technique, and in two patients the paraaortic region was not irradiated	
3165	The RBE of negative pions in the treatment of tumors with different volumes	Animals, Biophysics, Carcinoma,Ehrlich Tumor/rt [Radiotherapy], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Mathematics, Mesons, Mice, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Temperature, Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Universities	For negative pions, large differences exist between experimental RBE values obtained by in vivo investigations with animals and corresponding data being used in clinical tumor therapy. Therefore, the influence of the treatment volume on the radiation quality and respectively on the RBE is examined. The RBE for euoxic mammalian cells is measured with high precision in different volumes irradiated in the spot-scan mode with the PIOTRON at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It is shown experimentally that the RBE is reduced if the radius of the irradiation volume is increased. Using a simple mathematical approximation for the spot-scan technique this relation can be understood quantitatively. The same approximation is also used to calculate dose mean values for the lineal energy yD present in different irradiated volumes. The good agreement with existing experimental data for yD indicates that the approximation used is adequate and the main physical parameters have been taken into consideration. The above mentioned differences between animal experiments and treatment of patients can be explained by changes in the effective radiation quality due to the scanning procedure used in the clinical treatments	
1069	Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and intracellular distribution of the Auger electron emitter (65)Zn in two human cell lines	Apoptosis, Cell Line, Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Colony-Forming Units Assay, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Micronucleus Tests, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Zinc Radioisotopes/pd [Pharmacology]	Cell survival, induction of apoptosis, and micronucleus formation have been examined in non-transformed human amnion fluid fibroblast-like (AFFL) cells and in a human squameous cell carcinoma (SCL-II) cell line after exposure to the Auger electron emitter (65)Zn and after external low-LET radiation. Cellular uptake and subcellular distribution of (65)Zn(2+) were studied in vitro and the absorbed radiation dose was calculated applying analytical dosimetry models. Auger electrons generated during decay of (65)Zn induced a prominent decrease in cell survival and increased the levels of apoptotic as well as micronucleated cells when compared to external low-LET irradiation. Relative biological effectiveness has been determined for cell survival (RBE approximately 4), micronucleus formation (RBE approximately 2) and apoptosis induction (RBE approximately 5-8) in SCL-II cells and for micronucleus formation (RBE approximately 4-5) and apoptosis induction (RBE approximately 6-10) in AFFL cells, respectively. This demonstrates a general enhanced biological effectiveness of (65)Zn in both investigated cell lines when compared to external low-LET radiation. The distribution pattern of intracellular Zn(2+) was found to be non-uniform, showing enhanced amounts of Zn(2+) in the perinuclear region and low amounts inside the cell nucleus, suggesting a major energy deposition close to the nuclear envelope	
2003	A treatment planning inter-comparison of proton and intensity modulated photon radiotherapy	Algorithms, Female, Humans, Lead, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between standard photon delivery techniques,b intensity modulated photon methods and spot scanned protons in order to investigate the merits and limitations of each of these treatment approaches. METHODS: Plans for each modality were performed using CT scans and planning information for nine patients with varying indications and lesion sites and the results have been analysed using a variety of dose and volume based parameters. RESULTS: Over all cases, it is predicted that the use of protons could lead to a reduction of the total integral dose by a factor three compared to standard photon techniques and a factor two compared to IM photon plans. In addition, in all but one Organ at Risk (OAR) for one case, protons are predicted to reduce both mean OAR dose and the irradiated volume at the 50% mean target dose level compared to both photon methods. However, when considering the volume of an OAR irradiated to 70% or more of the target dose, little difference could be shown between proton and intensity modulated photon plans. On comparing the magnitude of dose hot spots in OARs resulting from the proton and IM photon plans, more variation was observed, and the ranking of the plans was then found to be case and OAR dependent. CONCLUSIONS: The use of protons has been found to reduce the medium to low dose load (below about 70% of the target dose) to OARs and all non-target tissues compared to both standard and inversely planned photons, but that the use of intensity modulated photons can result in similar levels of high dose conformation to that afforded by protons. However, the introduction of inverse planning methods for protons is necessary before general conclusions on the relative efficacy of photons and protons can be drawn	
1185	Stereotactic radiosurgery XVI: Isodosimetric comparison of photon stereotactic radiosurgery techniques (gamma knife vs. micromultileaf collimator linear accelerator) for acoustic neuroma--and potential clinical importance	England, Hearing, Humans, Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage	PURPOSE: Two stereotactic photon radiation therapy methods are currently in practice for the treatment of acoustic neuroma. In the 1990s, our data and those of others demonstrated isodosimetric advantages for gamma knife technology over linear accelerator methodology. Since then, the introduction of micromultileaf collimator technology has improved the conformity of the linear accelerator method such that the isodosimetric differences between the two techniques have narrowed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, modern gamma knife isodosimetry was compared to that of modern linac technology (conformal fixed fields and dynamic arcs) for the therapy of acoustic neuroma. This is an unusual target in that a special sensory nerve (holding the key to hearing preservation) frequently runs through the targeted volume, unlike the majority of other stereotactic radiation therapy targets. This was a single-dose prescription comparison; the perceived extra benefit of fractionation (a technique not routinely available to the gamma knife) was thereby abrogated. RESULTS: Although the gamma knife technique maintained a slight, but statistically significant, advantage with regard to dose conformity (p < 0.02) (at the debatable cost of a lower minimum target dose), the much higher internal dose gradient (high maximum dose to prescription dose [MD:PD] ratio) could be interpreted as a disadvantage with respect to hearing preservation, although advantageous with regard to tumor ablation. Of the two linac methods, the dynamic arc method gave a statistically significant advantage over the fixed-field method as regards conformity (p < 0.05), at the expense of a slightly higher brainstem dose (an average of 12.4 Gy, cf. 11.7 Gy for fixed fields), but this result was not statistically significant. No significant difference was seen in the MD:PD ratio for the two single-isocenter linac techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife methodology remains well validated, with very good isodosimetry, but when hearing preservation is important, the improving linac technologies will compete with the gamma knife for optimal therapy. In these circumstances, the minor differences in isodosimetry between the two techniques will become important	
4713	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry of the head and neck: a comparison of treatment plans using linear accelerator-based IMRT and helical tomotherapy	Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Methods, Neck, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Gland, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography,Spiral Computed/mt [Methods], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	PURPOSE: To date, most intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery has occurred using linear accelerators (linacs), although helical tomotherapy has become commercially available. To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

The purpose of this study was to compare metastatic capabilities of malignant tumor cells after irradiation with photon, proton, and carbon ion beams to clarify their ion beam-specific biological effects. We examined the biological properties of highly aggressive HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to assess their metastatic processes in terms of cell adhesion capability to extracellular matrix, expression of integrins, cell migration, cell invasive capability, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in vitro. We then assessed the metastatic capabilities of LM8 mouse osteosarcoma irradiated with carbon ion or photon beam in the syngeneic mice. Both proton and carbon ion irradiation decreased cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner and strongly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity. On the other hand, lower X-ray irradiation promoted cell migration and invasion concomitant with up-regulation of alphaVbeta3 integrin. For cancer cells treated with carbon ion irradiation, the number of pulmonary metastasis was decreased significantly in vivo. These findings suggest that particle irradiation suppresses metastatic potential even at lower dose, whereas photon irradiation promotes cell migration and invasive capabilities at lower dose level, and provide preclinical evidence that ion beam radiotherapy may be superior to conventional photon beam therapy in possible preventive effects on metastases of irradiated malignant tumor cells	
599	On measuring depth-dose distribution of range-modulated proton therapy fields	Algorithms, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Protons, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Software, Time, Time Factors	Depth-dose profile measurements are frequently performed for the characterization of spread-out Bragg peak treatment fields in proton therapy. The measured distribution often contains a significant amount of noise with a persistent pattern. As a result, substantial smoothing has to be applied which can alter a measurement. We explored the origin of the observed noise by closely examining the sampling process in the scanning algorithm. We will show that the time characteristics of the signal in the range-modulated proton therapy beams differ significantly from those in the photon beams, and as a result the measurement error is very sensitive to the sampling duration. The observed noise results mainly from inappropriate choices for this value, rather than from the dose distribution itself. Increasing the value arbitrarily may actually increase the noise magnitude. We will demonstrate that with an optimal value for the sampling duration and its accurate control, the noise magnitude can be reduced significantly, without increasing the measurement time	
235	Experimental measurement of radiological penumbra associated with intermediate energy x-rays (1 MV) and small radiosurgery field sizes	Calibration, Computer Simulation, Electrons, Equipment Design, Film Dosimetry/mt [Methods], Gamma Rays, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Trigeminal Neuralgia/di [Diagnosis], Trigeminal Neuralgia/ra [Radiography], X-Rays	Stereotactic radiosurgery is used to treat intracranial lesions with a high degree of accuracy. At the present time, x-ray energies at or above Co-60 gamma rays are used. Previous Monte Carlo simulations have demonstrated that intermediate energy x-ray photons or IEPs (defined to be photons in the energy range of 0.2-1.2 MeV), combined with small field sizes, produce a reduced radiological penumbra leading to a sharper dose gradient, improved dose homogeneity and sparing of critical anatomy adjacent to the target volume. This hypothesis is based on the fact that, for small x-ray fields, a dose outside the treatment volume is dictated mainly by the range of electrons set into motion by x-ray photons. The purpose of this work is: (1) to produce intermediate energy x rays using a detuned medical linear accelerator, (2) to characterize the energy of this beam, (3) to measure the radiological penumbra for IEPs and small fields to compare with that produced by 6 MV x rays or Co-60, and (4) to compare these experimental measurements with Monte Carlo computer simulations. The maximum photon energy of our IEP x-ray spectrum was measured to be 1.2 MeV. Gafchromic EBT films (ISP Technologies, Wayne, NJ) were irradiated and read using a novel digital microscopy imaging system with high spatial resolution. Under identical irradiation conditions the measured radiological penumbra widths (80%-20% distance), for field sizes ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 to 4.0 x 4.0 cm2, varied from 0.3-0.77 mm (1.2 MV) and from 1.1-2.1 mm (6 MV). Even more dramatic were the differences found when comparing the 90%-10% or the 95%-5% widths, which are in fact more significant in radiotherapy. Monte Carlo simulations agreed well with the experimental findings. The reduction in radiological penumbra could be substantial for specific clinical situations such as in the treatment of an ocular melanoma abutting the macula or for the treatment of functional disorders such as trigeminal neuralgia (a nonlethal neurological pathology) where no long-term side effect should be induced by the treatment	
1941	p53 mutations in tumor and non-tumor tissues of thorotrast recipients: a model for cellular selection during radiation carcinogenesis in the liver	Aged, Alpha Particles, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], DNA Mutational Analysis, Energy Transfer, Female, Genomic Instability, Humans, Japan, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/ge [Genetics], Male, Middle Aged, Models,Genetic, Mutation, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ge [Genetics], Neoplastic Processes, Point Mutation, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Polymorphism,Single-Stranded Conformational, Public Health, Radiation, Radiobiology, Radon, Research, Risk, Survival, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/ge [Genetics]	Concerns over cancer development from exposure to environmental sources of densely ionizing, high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, such as alpha-particles from radon, is a current public health issue. The study of tumors attributable to high LET irradiation would greatly augment our insights into the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Chronic low-dose-rate internal exposure to alpha-radiation from thorium dioxide deposits following intravascular administration of the radiographic contrast agent Thorotrast is known to markedly increase the risk of cancer development, especially that of hepatic angiosarcomas and cholangiocarcinomas. Although the mechanism is hypothesized to be via cellular damage, DNA being a major target, wrought by the high LET alpha-particles, the specific genes and the actual sequence of events involved in the process of transforming a normal cell into a malignant one are largely unknown. To shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of cancer development during a lifetime exposure to alpha-radiation, we analyzed the most commonly affected tumor suppressor gene in humans, p53, in 20 Thorotrast recipients who developed cancer, mostly of hepatic bile duct and blood vessel origin. Of the 20 cases, 19 were found to harbor p53 point mutations. Moreover, the accompanying non-tumor tissues from these patients also had p53 mutations, albeit at lower frequency. The distribution pattern of the point mutations was significantly different between the non-tumor and tumor tissues, with most mutations in malignant tissues located in the highly conserved domains of the p53 gene. Our results support the idea that p53 mutations are important in the genesis of Thorotrast-induced tumors but that these point mutations are a secondary outcome of genomic instability induced by the irradiation. Additionally, non-tumor cells harboring p53 mutations may gain some survival advantage in situ but mutations in the domains responsible for the formation of structural elements critical in binding DNA may be necessary for a cell to reach full malignancy	
3789	A model for calculating the effects of small inhomogeneities on electron beam dose distributions	Air, Humans, Motion, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Solutions	Charged particles penetrating a medium are repeatedly deflected from their line of motion by coulomb interactions with target nuclei. This physical feature should be included in the calculation of dose distributions when the irradiated medium contains small inhomogeneities. We use the mean path taken by particles in homogeneous media to represent their motion through inhomogeneous materials. This procedure adapts wht small angle multiple scattering formalism to yield manageable, approximate solutions when a medium contains arbitrarily composed inhomogeneities. To promote the development of this procedure into an electron beam treatment planning program, we discuss the salient features which arise in connection with electron beam inhomogeneity calculations. We use a solid phantom containing an air cavity just below its surface as a particular example of a small inhomogeneity. We discuss qualitatively and quantitatively the dose distributions which result from their irradiation with an 11-MeV electron beam	
113	Photon dose calculations in homogeneous media for a treatment planning system using a collapsed cone superposition convolution algorithm	Algorithms, Biophysics, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Technology,Radiologic	This work reports on some of the initial tests that were conducted during the commissioning of a commercially available 3D treatment planning system. The system (Pinnacle 3.0d-u1) uses a collapsed cone implementation of the superposition convolution algorithm. Calculated and measured dose in homogeneous media were compared for wedged and unwedged fields for both symmetric and asymmetric collimator settings. Results show agreement of 2% or 2 mm in most cases. Where larger differences were found, further investigation was undertaken to explain these differences. These tests demonstrate the correct behaviour of the collapsed cone implementation of the algorithm in homogeneous media and its ability to characterize the beam

Neuroimaging with technetium 99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid and positron emission tomographic scanning with fludeoxyglucose F 18 aided in his evaluation. Significant improvement of his neurologic deficits resulted from corticosteroid therapy. Clinical resolution was corroborated by serial computed tomographic scans demonstrating regression of the abnormality (a mass lesion). Various facets of radiation injury are discussed, including pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and therapy	
3718	Radiation protection aspects of a new high-energy linear accelerator	Canada, Electrons, Humans, Neutrons, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Polyethylene, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring, Radiation Protection, Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	The Therac-25 is a new 25-MeV linear accelerator manufactured by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd. The first two units have recently been installed in Toronto, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Calculations and measurements of primary and secondary radiation levels were made. Neutron dose-equivalent rates were measured inside and outside the room. The maximum leakage rate at 1 m from the accelerator target was 0.4% Sv per peak photon Gy. The tenth value layer for neutrons from the Therac-25, at the entrance to a one-legged maze was found to be 5.5 cm of polyethylene. Measurements were done to estimate daily technologist exposure due to induced activity in the treatment room

To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases	
1721	Backscatter dose from metallic materials due to obliquely incident high-energy photon beams	Biophysics, Copper, Electrons, Fluorescence, Humans, Lead, Metals, Nuclear Medicine, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prostheses and Implants, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Scattering,Radiation, Silver, Universities	If metallic material is exposed to ionizing radiation of sufficient high energy, an increase in dose due to backscatter radiation occurs in front of this material. Our purpose in this study was to quantify these doses at variable distances between scattering materials and the detector at axial beam angles between 0 degree (zero angle in beams eye view) and 90 degrees. Copper, silver and lead sheets embedded in a phantom of perspex were exposed to 10 MV-bremsstrahlung. The detector we developed is based on the fluorescence property of pyromellitic acid (1,2,4,5 benzenetetracarboxylic acid) after exposure to ionizing radiation. Our results show that the additional doses and the corresponding dose distribution in front of the scattering materials depend quantitatively and qualitatively on the beam angle. The backscatter dose increases with varying beam angle from 0 degree to 90 degrees up to a maximum at 55 degrees for copper and silver. At angles of 0 degree and 55 degrees the integral backscatter doses over a tissue-equivalent depth of 2 mm are 11.2% and 21.6% for copper and 24% and 28% for silver, respectively. In contrast, in front of lead there are no obvious differences of the measured backscatter doses at angles between 0 degree and 55 degrees. With a further increase of the beam angle from 55 degrees to 90 degrees the backscatter dose decreases steeply for all three materials. In front of copper a markedly lower penetrating depth of the backscattered electrons was found for an angle of 0 degree compared to 55 degrees. This dependence from the beam angle was less pronounced in front of silver and not detectable in front of lead. In conclusion, the dependence of the backscatter dose from the angle between axial beam and scattering material must be considered, as higher scattering doses have to be considered than previously expected. This may have a clinical impact since the surface of metallic implants is usually curved	
758	Estimation of the dose to the nursing infant due to direct irradiation from activity present in maternal organs and tissues	Adult, Body Burden, Brazil, Breast, Breast Feeding, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Linear Energy Transfer/ph [Physiology], Liver, Lung, Maternal Exposure, Monte Carlo Method, Organ Specificity, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/an [Analysis], Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Whole-Body Counting/mt [Methods]	Radionuclides deposited internally in the mother will give rise to a radiation dose in the infant in two ways. The radionuclides may be transferred through milk and give rise to an internal dose in the infant, or the radionuclides may emit photons that are absorbed by the infant, giving rise to an external dose. In this paper, the external dose to the newborn infant caused by direct irradiation was estimated for monoenergetic photons. Voxel models (also called voxel phantoms) of the mother and infant were made in three geometries. These models, consisting of volume elements, or voxels, were designed so that the infant model was placed in the lap, at the breast and on the shoulder of the mother model. The Visual Monte Carlo (VMC) code was used to transport the photons through the voxel models. Source regions for the emitted photons, such as the whole body, the thyroid, the lung, the liver and the skeleton, were chosen. For the validation of the calculation procedure, VMC results were favourably compared with the results obtained by using other Monte Carlo programs and also with the previously published results for specific absorbed fractions. This paper provides estimates of the external dose per photon to the infant for photon energies between 0.05 and 2.5 MeV. The external dose per photon estimates were made for the three geometries and for the sources listed above. The results show that, for the geometry of the nursing infant model at the breast, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited in the mother's liver. For the nursing infant model at the shoulder, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited in the mother's thyroid, and for the nursing infant model in the lap, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited uniformly in the whole body. The dose per photon results were then used to estimate the dose an infant might receive over the lactation period (6 months) due to the incorporation of 1 Bq of a radionuclide by the mother. This information may be used to provide external dose estimates to the infant in the case of a known or suspected radionuclide incorporation by the mother due to, for example, a nuclear medicine procedure

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 65 women (age 25-70 years, mean 47 years) with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB were initially treated with external beam radiotherapy on a telecobalt or 6 MV linear accelerator to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 5-6 weeks. After 2-3 weeks of completing external radiation, patients received interstitial brachytherapy with Iridium-192 (activity 0.5-1 mCi/cm) using a Syed-Neblett perineal template. The median dose delivered to the implant volume was 24 Gy (range 20-32 Gy) delivered at an average dose rate of 0.70 Gy/h (range 0.40-1.20 Gy/h). A point defined at 1.5 cm lateral to the central uterine tandem at the level of os was taken as a representative for assessing the dose to the cervix. Mean doses delivered by interstitial brachytherapy to point A, cervix, point B and rectum were 38 Gy, 34 Gy, 16 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 53 months, the actuarial disease free survival and overall survival for 65 patients at both 5 and 10 years was 64% and 44%, respectively. Response to radiotherapy was a strong predictor of local control with 82% of patients continuing to have pelvic control after initial complete response. Overall, nine (14%) patients had persistent disease, ten (15%) developed a central recurrence after initial control and three patients developed distant metastasis on follow-up. No patient had any immediate treatment-related complication. Late toxicity included grade I-II rectal reactions in five patients and grade IV bladder complication (vesico-vaginal fistula) in two patients. 5 years after treatment, one patient developed intestinal obstruction, which was relieved after conservative management. Two patients developed vaginal stenosis. The 5- and 10-year disease free survival was 48% in patients aged less than 45 years as compared to 80% in patients of more than 45 years (p = 0.009). Dose to the cervical point was a prognostic indicator with 5- and 10-year disease free survival of 47% in patients who received < 35 Gy in comparison to 80% in patients who had > 35 Gy (p = 0.03). There was no difference in local control and survival in patients with minimal and moderate parametrial involvement. Bulky disease (> 4 cm) at presentation and a longer gap between external radiation and brachytherapy showed a trend towards inferior local control. CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial brachytherapy after external beam irradiation in patients with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB results in acceptable local control, survival and complication rates. Increased dose to the cervical disease results in improved local control and survival and should therefore be considered while optimizing brachytherapy treatment plans. Comparison of the results with those of standard intracavitary therapy remains to be proven in a randomized trial	
3198	Survey of cellular radiosensitivity parameters	Animals, Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Chemistry, DNA, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons, Emulsions, Gamma Rays, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Kidney/re [Radiation Effects], Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Theoretical, Radiation, Radiation,Ionizing, Research, Spores,Bacterial/re [Radiation Effects], Universities	A model of the formation of particle tracks in emulsion has been extended through the use of biological target theory to formulate a theory of the response of biological cells and molecules of biological importance to irradiation with energetic heavy ions. For this purpose the response to gamma rays is represented by the single-hit, multitarget model with parameters m and D0, while additional parameters kappa (or a0) and sigma 0 are required to represent the size of internal cellular targets and the effective cross-sectional area of the cell nucleus, respectively, for heavy-ion bombardments. For one-or-more-hit detectors, only the first three of these parameters are required and m = 1. For cells m is typically 2 or more. The model is developed from the concept that response to secondary electrons follows the same functional form for gamma rays and for the gamma rays surrounding an ion's path. Originally applied to dry enzymes and viruses in 1967, the model of the one-hit detector has been extended to emulsions, to other physical and chemical detectors, to single- and double-strand breaks in DNA in EO buffer and to three E. coli strains. The two-hit response has been observed for "track core" effects in radiation chemistry, for supralinearity in thermoluminescent dosimeters and for desensitized nuclear emulsions, where hit numbers up to 6 have been observed. In its extension to biological cells, additional concepts are required relating to the character of the track, namely the grain-count and track-width regimes, and to the ability of multitarget systems to acquire damage from intertrack delta rays (called gamma kill) as well as from intratrack delta rays (called ion kill). The model has been applied to some 40 sets of radiobiological data obtained from gamma, track-segment heavy-ion and neutron irradiations. Here we elaborate on the meaning of these concepts, tabulate the cellular parameters, and display their systematic behavior and the relationships among them. In particular the parameter kappa, which serves to determine the location in Z*2/beta 2 of the maximum value of the RBE, shows little variation among cell types, while D0, which describes the response to gamma rays and sigma 0, which appears to indicate the target size, varies over many orders of magnitude

3173	[The results of neurosurgical treatment in Itsenko-Cushing's disease]. [Russian]	Adenoma/di [Diagnosis], Adenoma/su [Surgery], Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Chronic Disease, Cushing Syndrome/di [Diagnosis], Cushing Syndrome/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Hyperplasia, Male, Microsurgery, Middle Aged, Neurosurgical Procedures, Pituitary Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Pituitary Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Remission Induction	Fifty three consecutive patients with Cushing's disease were operated on in the Neurosurgical Institute from 1987 to 1995. In all cases the diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory data, as well as radiographic images. Ten patients with false-negative CT scans had MRI confirming the presence of microadenomas less than 5 mm in size. The majority of patients (n = 51) were operated via transsphenoidal approach, transcranial route was utilized in 2 cases. Among the pathological findings, corticotropinomas were revealed in 49 cases, 4 patients were considered to have hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary without well demarcated adenoma. All patients were divided into 2 groups based on the history of previous treatment. Group 1 included 37 primary patients who had not been treated before admission. Group 2 included 16 patients treated surgically (e.g. neurosurgical operations, bilateral/unilateral adrenalectomy), or with irradiation therapy, including proton beam irradiation prior to admission. We came to conclusion that the following principles were essential in the management of Cushing's disease. 1. Properly interpreted clinical signs and symptoms along with biochemical data and radiographic imaging (including MRI) are extremely helpful in the preoperative evaluation of such patients. Our approach helped us reveal corticotropinomas with 98% accuracy. 2. Microsurgical removal was proved to be effective in up to 83% of patients, which was demonstrated by clinical and biochemical remission. 3. It should be emphasized that the results of treatment were significantly better in the first group versus the second one. In group 1, remission was reached in 91.1% of patients as compared to 62.5% in Group 2. 4. In primary patients, the trauma associated with surgical procedure is less and tumors demonstrate a less aggressive biological behavior

These beams were generated by the NOVAC7 system (Hitesys, Italy), a mobile electron accelerator specifically dedicated to intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT). The electron beam simulations were verified by comparing the measured dose distributions with the corresponding calculated distributions. As expected, a considerable difference was observed in the energy and angular distributions between the IORT beams studied in the present work and the electron beams produced by conventional accelerators for non-IORT applications. It was also found that significant differences exist between the IORT beams used in this work and other IORT beams with different collimation systems. For example, the contribution from the scattered electrons to the total dose was found to be up to 15% higher in the NOVAC7 beams. The water-to-air stopping power ratios of the IORT beams used in this work were calculated on the basis of the beam energy distributions obtained by the Monte Carlo simulations. These calculated stopping power ratios, s(w,air), were compared with the corresponding s(w,air) values recommended by the TRS-381 and TRS-398 IAEA dosimetry protocols in order to estimate the deviations between a dosimetry based on generic parameters and a dosimetry based on parameters specifically obtained for the actual IORT beams. The deviations in the s(w,air) values were found to be as large as up to about 1%. Therefore, we recommend that a preliminary analysis should always be made when dealing with IORT beams in order to assess to what extent the possible differences in the s(w,air) values have to be accounted for or may be neglected on the basis of the specific accuracy needed in clinical dosimetry	
1205	Radiation dose as a risk factor for malignant melanoma following childhood cancer	Adolescent, Adult, Case-Control Studies, Child, Child,Preschool, Cohort Studies, Energy Transfer, Follow-Up Studies, France, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Linear Energy Transfer, Melanoma, Melanoma/et [Etiology], Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Second Primary/et [Etiology], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Odds Ratio, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Registries, Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms/et [Etiology], Survivors	The aim of this study was to determine therapy-related risk factors for the development of melanoma after childhood cancer. Among 4401 3-year survivors of a childhood cancer in eight French and British centres and 25120 patients younger than 20 years old at first malignant neoplasm (FMN) extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, 16 patients developed a melanoma as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). A cohort study of the French and British cohorts was performed. In a nested case-control study, the 16 patients who developed a melanoma as a SMN (cases) were matched with 3-5 controls in their respective cohort according to gender, age at the first cancer, the calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer and follow-up. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of melanoma for local doses >15 Gy, Odds Ratio (OR)=13 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.94-174). Regarding chemotherapy, we observed an increased OR for both alkylating agents and spindle inhibitors, OR=2.7 (95% CI: 0.5-14). Children treated for a gonadal tumour as a FMN were found to be at a higher risk of melanoma, OR=8.7 (95% CI: 0.9-86). The adjusted OR for the local radiation dose was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00-1.15). In conclusion, radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk of melanoma as a SMN, but only at very high doses of low linear energy transfer radiation. Common genetic origins between gonadal tumours and malignant melanomas are likely	
2156	[Assessment of potential exposure risk for radiotherapy staff working with lineal accelerators]. [Italian]	Humans, Occupational Exposure, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radioactivity, Radiotherapy, Risk, Risk Assessment, Safety, Time, Workload	INTRODUCTION: Radiation exposure to the radiotherapy staff operating with linear accelerators comes from both normal exposure, which can be easily quantified by direct measurement, and potential exposure, whose evaluation is made difficult by its stochastic character. International guidelines recommend that risk be of the same order of magnitude for both types of exposure. We evaluated the health risk associated with potential exposure following the fault-tree approach suggested by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (IRCP) in its Publication 76. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Considering a typical radiotherapy installation we identified four possible staff irradiation scenarios, namely: 1) entry into the treatment room after a high-energy photon beam treatment, when induced radioactivity from photonuclear reactions has not decayed; 2) unintentional entry into the treatment room when the radiation beam is on; 3) beam failing to turn off at the end of treatment, and subsequent entry into the treatment room; 4) treatment room door inadvertently left ajar, and subsequent entry when the radiation beam is on. Each scenario depends on a particular set of parameters which are related to failure probabilities and workload. Average absorbed dose, exposure probability and related risk have been evaluated for each scenario. RESULTS: Under standard parameter set-up, the overall risk did not exceed the IRCP threshold (i.e., .0002) by more than four orders of magnitude. Two main sources of potential exposure have been identified, that is early entry into the treatment room before safe decay of activation products and unintentional entry during treatment. By varying the parameters within reasonable ranges, risk has been shown to correlate with personnel training, workload, installation characteristics and operational procedures. To optimize protection, quantitative limitations have been set for human error probability, daily workload, number and quality of safety devices and waiting time before entry after a treatment with high-energy radiations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the potential exposure risk for a typical radiotherapy department with standard safety devices is well below international recommended values, our results indicate that risk can be further decreased by improving personnel training, in particular relative to minimum time to entry after a high-energy treatment, to respecting warning signs and being skilled in emergency procedures. In addition, failing to install some safety devices or removing them after a failure may result in rapidly exceeding IRCP thresholds	
4070	Photon beam attenuation for a patient support assembly during arc therapy for a medical linear accelerator	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Rotation	Arc therapy is one of the treatment techniques for small, centrally located deep-seated tumors. However, care must be taken to remove any components that would interfere with the beam as the gantry rotates around the patient. One such component that may interfere with the beam is the patient support assembly (PSA) or treatment table. Beam attenuation factors due to the presence of the couch side-rails and the centerspine bar of the PSA are presented for both 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams of a Clinac 1800 during a 360 degrees rotation. Dose perturbations arising from these obstructions are displayed using an Alderson Rando phantom. A method is described to calculate the start and stop angles for the largest unobstructed arc for a given field size (FS), centerspine bar to the isocenter height (H), centerspine bar width (W), and SAD. As an illustration, for an SAD of 100 cm and a W of 4 cm, the start and stop angles for arc therapy with a FS of 10 x 10 cm2 and an H of 12.7 cm would be 29 degrees and 331 degrees

METHODS: Twenty patients with multiple brain metastases not having received any previous brain radiation were selected for the study. The total radiation dose varied from 40 (20 fractions) to 50 (25 fractions) Gy, with an opposition technique. MRS was performed just before irradiation, during the acute phase (n = 20, 8.5 +/- 4.6 days) and in the early delayed phase (n = 15, 3.6 +/- 0.5 months) after radiation. The concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), choline-containing substance (Cho), and creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) was quantified. RESULTS: The concentration of NAA decreased (P = 0.05 versus before radiation), and the concentration of Cho increased (P = 0.006 versus before radiation) during the early delayed phase. The concentration of Cr was not changed before or after radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced changes in brain metabolism were well detected with quantitative MRS in the early delayed phase. Quantitative MRS is a novel tool for estimating radiation-induced neurotoxicity

Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been developed recently to image soft-tissue targets in the treatment room and guide the radiation therapy treatment. However, due to its relatively long image acquisition time the CBCT approach cannot provide images of the target at the instant of the treatment and thus it is not adequate for imaging targets with intrafraction motion. In this note, a new approach for image-guided radiation therapy-just-in-time tomography (JiTT)-is proposed. Differing from CBCT, JiTT takes much less time to generate the needed tomographical, beam's-eye-view images of the treatment target at the right moment to guide the radiation therapy treatment

Biodosimetry of charged-particle radiation is analyzed in the present paper. Target cells were human peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated in vitro with gamma rays, protons and iron ions. After exposure, lymphocytes were incubated for different times to allow repair of radiation-induced damage and then fused to mitotic hamster cells to promote premature condensation in the interphase chromosomes. Chromosome spreads were then hybridized with whole-chromosome DNA probes labeled with fluorescent stains. Dose-response curves for the induction of chromatin fragments shortly after exposure, as well as the kinetics of rejoining and misrejoining, were not markedly dependent on linear energy transfer. However, after exposure to heavy ions, more aberrations were scored in the interphase cells after incubation for repair than in metaphase samples harvested at the first postirradiation mitosis. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in the two samples after exposure to sparsely ionizing radiation. These results suggest that interphase chromosome painting can be a useful tool for biodosimetry of particle radiation

Chondroid mineralisation, a histological feature of chondrosarcoma, can be recognised on CT and is, together with the off-midline position of the tumour, the most characteristic finding. Differentiation is usually made by histological and immunocytochemical staining. Surgery, proton radiation therapy and stereotactic single high-dose irradiation have been used to treat patients with chondrosarcoma. It is worth mentioning that it was likely that the chondrosarcoma in our patient represented a malignant degeneration of an enchondroma that had been resected 30 years earlier

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation

We retrospectively analyzed patients with brain metastases of malignant melanoma who were treated at our institution for outcome and prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 64 patients with 122 cerebral metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery between 1986 and 2000. Twelve patients (19%) showed neurologic symptoms at the time of treatment, and 46 patients (72%) had extracerebral tumor manifestation at that time. The median dose to the 80% isodose line, prescribed to encompass the tumor margin, was 20 Gy (range, 15-22 Gy). RESULTS: Neurologic symptoms improved in five of twelve symptomatic patients. 41 patients remained asymptomatic or unchanged in their neurologic symptoms. Only five patients (8%) temporarily worsened neurologically after therapy despite no signs of tumor progression. With a mean follow-up time of 9.4 months, actuarial local control was 81% after 1 year. There was a statistically significant dose and size dependency of local tumor control. Median actuarial survival after treatment was 10.6 months. Patients without extracerebral tumor manifestation showed a superior survival (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high local tumor control rates, the prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases of malignant melanoma remains poor. Stereotactic radiosurgery has the potential of stabilizing or improving neurologic symptoms in these patients in a palliative setting

Mutagenesis analyses have revealed that radon induces mostly multi-locus chromosome deletions. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that deletion analysis of multiple radon-induced malignant transformants would reveal common mutations in chromosomal regions containing tumor suppressor genes responsible for malignant transformation. This hypothesis was supported by a previous study in which tumorigenic derivatives of the human papillomavirus 18-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line BEP2D were established following irradiation with 30 cGy of high linear energy transfer radon-simulated alpha-particles. Herein, we describe the analyses of 10 additional tumorigenic derivative cell lines resulting from the irradiation of five additional independent BEP2D populations. The new transformants have common cytogenetic changes, including the loss of chromosome (ch)Y, one of three copies of ch8, one of two copies of ch11p15-pter and one of three copies of ch14. These changes are the same as those reported previously. Analysis of PCR-amplified short tandem repeats of informative loci confirmed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 12 loci spanning the length of ch8 in cell lines from four of the total of eight irradiation treatments to date and the loss of chY in all cell lines (8 of 8). LOH analysis with a total of 17 informative loci confirmed loss on ch14 in transformants from seven of eight irradiation treatments and indicated a 0.5-1.7 cM region of common involvement centered around locus D14S306. No LOH was detected at any of the informative loci on ch11. The overall results support our stated hypothesis. Further studies are currently in progress to determine whether the ch8 and ch14 regions contain genes with tumor suppressor function in bronchial epithelial cells

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western-blot analysis of inducible nitric oxide synthase, hsp72 and p53, the concentration assay of nitrite in medium and cell survival assay after irradiation with accelerated carbon-ion beams were performed. RESULTS: The accumulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase was caused by accelerated carbon-ion beam irradiation of T98G cells but not of A-172 cells. The accumulation of hsp72 and p53 was observed in A-172 cells after exposure to the conditioned medium of the T98G cells irradiated with accelerated carbon-ion beams, and the accumulation was abolished by the addition of an inhibitor for inducible nitric oxide synthase to the medium. The radiosensitivity of A-172 cells was reduced in the conditioned medium of the T98G cells irradiated with accelerated carbon-ion beams compared with conventional fresh growth medium, and the reduction of radiosensitivity was abolished by the addition of an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor to the conditioned medium. CONCLUSIONS: Nitric oxide excreted from the irradiated donor cells with accelerated carbon-ion beams could modulate the radiosensitivity of recipient cells. These findings indicate the importance of an intercellular signal transduction pathway initiated by nitric oxide in the cellular response to accelerated heavy ions	
4564	Radiation-induced biologic bystander effect elicited in vitro by targeted radiopharmaceuticals labeled with alpha-, beta-, and auger electron-emitting radionuclides.[see comment]	Bystander Effect, Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Gamma Rays/tu [Therapeutic Use], Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Methods, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radioactivity, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Science, Survival, Universities, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Recent studies have shown that indirect effects of ionizing radiation may contribute significantly to the effectiveness of radiotherapy by sterilizing malignant cells that are not directly hit by the radiation. However, there have been few investigations of the importance of indirect effects in targeted radionuclide treatment. Our purpose was to compare the induction of bystander effects by external beam gamma-radiation with those resultant from exposure to 3 radiohaloanalogs of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG): (131)I-MIBG (low-linear-energy-transfer [LET] beta-emitter), (123)I-MIBG (potentially high-LET Auger electron emitter), and meta-(211)At-astatobenzylguanidine ((211)At-MABG) (high-LET alpha-emitter). METHODS: Two human tumor cell lines-UVW (glioma) and EJ138 (transitional cell carcinoma of bladder)-were transfected with the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) gene to enable active uptake of MIBG. Medium from cells that accumulated the radiopharmaceuticals or were treated with external beam radiation was transferred to cells that had not been exposed to radioactivity, and clonogenic survival was determined in donor and recipient cultures. RESULTS: Over the dose range 0-9 Gy of external beam radiation of donor cells, 2 Gy caused 30%-40% clonogenic cell kill in recipient cultures. This potency was maintained but not increased by higher dosage. In contrast, no corresponding saturation of bystander cell kill was observed after treatment with a range of activity concentrations of (131)I-MIBG, which resulted in up to 97% death of donor cells. Cellular uptake of (123)I-MIBG and (211)At-MABG induced increasing recipient cell kill up to levels that resulted in direct kill of 35%-70% of clonogens. Thereafter, the administration of higher activity concentrations of these high-LET emitters was inversely related to the kill of recipient cells. Over the range of activity concentrations examined, neither direct nor indirect kill was observed in cultures of cells not expressing the NAT and, thus, incapable of active uptake of MIBG. CONCLUSION: Potent toxins are generated specifically by cells that concentrate radiohalogenated MIBG. These may be LET dependent and distinct from those elicited by conventional radiotherapy	
281	The time dependence of bystander responses induced by iron-ion radiation in normal human skin fibroblasts	Bystander Effect/ph [Physiology], Bystander Effect/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts/ph [Physiology], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Iron, Iron Isotopes, Kinetics, Radiation Dosage, Research, Time Factors, X-Rays	Although bystander effects have been shown for some high-LET radiations, few studies have been done on bystander effects induced by heavy-ion radiation. In this study, using a Transwell insert co-culture system, we have demonstrated that irradiation with 1 GeV/nucleon iron ions can induce medium-mediated bystander effects in normal AG01522 human fibroblasts. When irradiated and unirradiated bystander cells were combined in shared medium immediately after irradiation, a two- to threefold increase in the percentage of bystander cells with gamma-H2AX foci occurred as early as 1 h after irradiation and lasted at least 24 h. There was a twofold increase in the formation of micronuclei in bystander cells when they were co-cultured with irradiated cells immediately or 1 or 3 h after irradiation, but there was no bystander effect when the cells were co-cultured 6 h or later after irradiation. In addition, bystander micronucleus formation was observed even when the bystander cells were co-cultured with irradiated cells for only 1 h. This indicates that the crucial signaling to bystander cells from irradiated cells occurs shortly after irradiation. Moreover, both gamma-H2AX focus formation and micronucleus formation in bystander cells were inhibited by the ROS scavengers SOD or catalase or the NO scavenger PTIO. This suggests that ROS and NO play important roles in the initiation of bystander effects. The results with iron ions were similar to those with X rays, suggesting that the bystander responses in this system are independent of LET	
1977	Treatment planning for heavy-ion radiotherapy: physical beam model and dose optimization	Algorithms, Carbon, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Models,Statistical, Planning Techniques, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Software	We describe a novel code system, TRiP, dedicated to the planning of radiotherapy with energetic ions, in particular 12C. The software is designed to cooperate with three-dimensional active dose shaping devices like the GSI raster scan system. This unique beam delivery system allows us to select any combination from a list of 253 individual beam energies, 7 different beam spot sizes and 15 intensity levels. The software includes a beam model adapted to and verified for carbon ions. Inverse planning techniques are implemented in order to obtain a uniform target dose distribution from clinical input data, i.e. CT images and patient contours. This implies the automatic generation of intensity modulated fields of heavy ions with as many as 40000 raster points, where each point corresponds to a specific beam position, energy and particle fluence. This set of data is directly passed to the beam delivery and control system. The treatment planning code has been in clinical use since the start of the GSI pilot project in December 1997. Forty-eight patients have been successfully planned and treated	
2745	The evidence for one-hit chromosome exchanges	Chromosome Aberrations, Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Mathematics, Models,Biological, Radiation	Luchnik [5] has recently questioned the need for a one-hit chromosome exchange mechanism to explain the dicentric yield in human lymphocytes following irradiation by low LET radiations. An analysis of more recent experimental data is given and this shows that models which approximate to the sum of a term proportional to dose and a term proportional to dose squared fit the available data better than a simple two-hit model. The fits however, are generally poor which is probably due to underestimating the errors involved

The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relative to cobalt-60 gamma radiation was determined under conditions of complete oxygenation. The data indicate that the radioresistance ascribed to malignant melanoma in vivo is not an intrinsic quality of the cell but rather may be mediated by the in vivo environment

The major defect in XP is a failure to repair UV damage to DNA; in AT, the failure is in repair or replication of double-strand breaks in DNA; in CS, the failure is in recovery of DNA replication after UV irradiation. Cancer is a major clinical feature of XP and AT, but not of CS. Each disease is complex, with multiple groups defined by complementation in cell-cell hybridization. Overlap is reported between some XP and CS groups. UV-sensitive hamster cell mutants are also known: most of these complement XP groups, and a human gene on chromosome 19 can correct the defects in hamster mutants, but not XP. XP group C is distinct from the other groups in exhibiting a strongly clustered mode of repair, as if only certain regions of the genome can be mended. This mode mainly occurs in confluent group C cells under conditions that permit much greater survival than in exponential growth, and therefore represents a more efficient mode of repair. These diseases all represent important examples of perturbation in the way carcinogen damage in DNA is metabolized, and further research aimed at identifying the kinds of molecular changes involved in the malignancy will be important	
4072	Extrafocal radiation: a unified approach to the prediction of beam penumbra and output factors for megavoltage x-ray beams	Air, Biophysics, Calibration, Canada, Head, Humans, Jaw, London, Models,Theoretical, Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Technology,Radiologic, Universities, Water, X-Rays	An extrafocal source model has been developed to explain the dependence of head scatter and beam penumbra on field size. In this model, the x-ray source of a medical linear accelerator is described by two components: a small but intense focal component; and a broadly distributed extrafocal component of low intensity. The extrafocal component is so large that it can be "eclipsed" by the field-defining collimators. Extrafocal radiation was found to account for 12% of the energy fluence on the central axis of the 6 MV x-ray beam from a Varian Clinac 2100 c accelerator. Head scatter factors were calculated "in-air" for symmetric, asymmetric, and half-blocked fields. Calculations agreed with measured values to better than 0.5%, on average. However, head scatter factors for asymmetric fields were underestimated by 1.2% when one of the field dimensions was reduced to 4 cm (the minimum jaw setting that was tested). The extrafocal source model was combined with a convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm to calculate dose-per-monitor-unit calibration (output) factors and beam dose profiles in water. These dose calculations predict the degradation of the field edge as a function of field size, and calculate output factors to within 0.5%, on average. In the most extreme case of a 4 cm field width, output factors were underestimated by 2%. Dose profiles are predicted without the aid of an empirical fit to measured beam penumbra data. The extrafocal source model will be particularly useful for fields defined by independent jaw and multileaf collimation systems

Teletherapy equipment and simulators	Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Physics, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Safety	A comprehensive Quality Assurance program in a radiation therapy center is desirable regardless of its size, and should cover among others the following areas: physical parameters of the therapy machines, dosimetric standards, preventive maintenance of radiation emitting sources and measuring instruments. In a radiation therapy center, regardless of its size and patient load, it is advisable to have a quality assurance program covering all the treatment planning steps. The following areas should be taken into consideration: physical parameters of the machines; dosimetric standards; radiation safety procedures and preventive maintenance of irradiators and radiation measuring instruments. The minimum instrumentation required and the critical parameters to be observed to establish a quality assurance program are discussed; the suggestions are applicable to the various sizes of radiation therapy centers. It is essential that all the procedures and results obtained are well documented and a critical evaluation of the program be performed periodically. The procedures and frequency suggested are applicable to low, medium and high energy treatment machines and simulators. The fluctuation on physical parameters currently observed in clinical physics practice strongly supports the efforts and costs of a quality assurance program

An optimal configuration is suggested for the beam shaping assembly made from polytetrafluoroethylene and magnesium fluorine to be placed on high current IPPE proton accelerator KG-2.5. Results of calculation were experimentally tested and are in good agreement with measurements	
1083	Inverse planning of intensity modulated proton therapy	Algorithms, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Time	A common requirement of radiation therapy is that treatment planning for different radiation modalities is devised on the basis of the same treatment planning system (TPS). The present study presents a novel multi-modal TPS with separate modules for the dose calculation, the optimization engine and the graphical user interface, which allows to integrate different treatment modalities. For heavy-charged particles, both most promising techniques, the distal edge tracking (DET) and the 3-dimensional scanning (3D) technique can be optimized. As a first application, the quality of optimized intensity-modulated treatment plans for photons (IMXT) and protons (IMPT) was analyzed in one clinical case on the basis of the achieved physical dose distributions. A comparison of the proton plans with the photon plans showed no significant improvement in terms of target volume dose, however there was an improvement in terms of organs at risk as well as a clear reduction of the total integral dose. For the DET technique, it is possible to create a treatment plan with almost the same quality of the 3D technique, however with a clearly reduced number (factor of 5) of beam spots as well as a reduced optimization time. Due to its modular design, the system can be easily expanded to more sophisticated dose-calculation algorithms or to modeling of biological effects

The period of 50% decrease in tumor size in response to radiation treatment was established in 116 patients with cervical carcinoma by means of a dynamical cytological examination. Acceleration of tumor regression was followed by an increase in 5-year survival rates. A reverse correlation was established between growth and regression rates of cervical carcinoma. Thanks to the determination of tumor regression rates, various modalities of radiation treatment could be evaluated in the course of therapy and their efficacy predicted

Despite of extended and radical surgery the recurrence rates after resection of pancreatic cancer remain high. Several studies have indicated some chemo- and radiosensitivity of these tumors. Whether a (combination-)chemotherapy alone or a combined radiochemotherapy should be recommended can actually not be answered yet. However, adjuvant radiotherapy alone seems to be inferior to combined radiochemotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy as well as preoperative radiotherapy are not superior to postoperative percutaneous radiotherapy regarding recurrence rate and survival. Preoperative radiotherapy, preferably in combination with chemotherapy, should be considered in patients with non resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic tumors with the aim of downstaging and secondary resection. The preliminary results of regional adjuvant chemotherapy are impressing, but need to be confirmed in further, randomised studies. Overall, the availability of a good or even optimal adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer still seems to be far away. Therefore, all surgeons need to be encouraged to include their patients with resected pancreatic carcinoma in a current study protocol of adjuvant treatment, since only tenacious and multicentric research can lead to progress in this severe disease.

The system comprises a compact diagnostic X-ray unit mounted on the accelerator head, with its source in the isocentric plane exactly 37 degrees around from the therapy source. The image detector is an image intensifier with digital image storage/processing facilities. Images were taken at the accelerator of treatment fields in seven patients (pelvic, head and neck, chest fields) and these images were comparable in anatomical contrast to simulator radiographs. Two techniques for marking the therapy field onto the portal images were successfully demonstrated. One was to mark relevant corners or edges of the therapy light field on the skin using small Pb markers which become clearly visible in the 'diagnostic' portal image. The other was to record a separate 'therapy' image and through the software, extract and superimpose the field edges on to the 'diagnostic' image. The system and method proved fundamentally sound on criteria of image quality, geometric precision of rotation between therapy and imaging conditions, and its potential for development as a practical clinical tool

A dose enhancement, due to the photoelectric effect and pair production, near targets with platinum implants (with a high atomic number) in radiosurgery cannot be predicted by the XKnife radiosurgery treatment planning system. In the present work, Monte Carlo simulations using PRESTA EGS4 were employed to investigate the resulting dose enhancements from 4, 6, and 10 MV energies commonly used in the stereotactic radiosurgery system. Dose enhancements from 32% to 68% were observed close to the platinum implant for the above energies when using a 12.5 mm collimator. Comparatively higher dose enhancements were observed when using smaller collimators. It was found that this dose enhancement increased with beam energy but decreased as beam size increased

DESIGN: Noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a series of 63 patients (76 eyes) with choroidal metastases treated with proton beam therapy between December 1989 and September 2000. METHODS: Patients were treated with 2 fractions of 14 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) (CGE = proton Gy x relative biological effectiveness 1.1), each using a nonoperative "light-field" technique. Ophthalmologic follow-up was available for 46 patients (55 eyes), with a mean follow-up time of 10 months. The medical record or the Social Security Death Index was used to obtain survival status, which was available in 94% of cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor regression, recurrence, treatment-associated complications, and visual acuity were evaluated by ophthalmologic examination and ultrasonography. Eye retention and length of survival also were assessed. RESULTS: At the time of ocular diagnosis, 49 patients reported a history of a primary cancer. Median survival time after ocular diagnosis was 16 months through May 2003. Most choroidal metastases were dome shaped (62%) and located at the posterior pole (95%). Mean tumor height was approximately 3.5 mm, and serous retinal detachment was seen in 63% of cases. Eighty-four percent of treated tumors regressed completely within 5 months of treatment, and none of these recurred. Retinal detachment resolved in 82% of patients within 3.8 months after treatment, and visual acuity was preserved or improved in 47% of the patients. Complications occurred in 56% of cases and included madarosis, keratitis, dry eye syndrome, cataract, neovascular glaucoma, chorioretinal atrophy, radiation papillopathy, and radiation maculopathy. None of the treated eyes required enucleation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation is a useful therapeutic approach for choroidal metastases; it allows retention of the globe, achieves a high probability of local tumor control, and helps to avoid pain and visual loss. Although complications occur in most cases, many of these are minor and are not associated with a change in function. This modality is accurate and efficient, because it only entails 2 treatment fractions and does not require surgery for tumor localization

Experimental work with 30-60 MeV protons on beryllium and other elements has shown how these difficulties can to a large extent be overcome. Angular distributions and kerma rates as a function of proton energy are presented for various targets. Thin targets are found to be a better method than filtration for improving the penetration of the beam. A 237Np fission counter and a GM counter have been used to decompose stray radiation into its neutron and gamma-ray components. A model of a treatment head was found to attenuate the neutron component to less than 1% of its value in the useful beam

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (pts) were selected to receive an aggressive TURB followed by 2 MCV cycles, and HFRT with concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (33 pts) or HFRT and concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (20 pts). The 5-FU and CDDP doses ranged from 180 to 220 mg/sm/day and from 4 to 6 mg/sm/day, respectively. Radiotherapy was delivered as three 100 cGy fraction per day or two 150 cGy fraction per day to a total dose of 50 Gy to the pelvis and a 20 Gy boost to the bladder. RESULTS: Grade III toxicity in pts who received or not MCV was: rectal tenesmus 12/33 and 0/20, dysuria 6/33 and 4/20, leukopenia 3/33 and 0/20, thrombocytopenia 7/33 and 1/20 pts, respectively. A Grade IV toxicity was observed in 2 pts. Of the 28 evaluable patients treated with MCV, CR were observed in 23 (82%) and PR in 5 cases. Of the 18 evaluable patients treated without MCV, CR were observed in 18 cases (100%). Actually, 65% and 14% of the CR pts treated with or without HCV are alive and free of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This bladder-sparing treatment shows an acceptable acute and late toxicity, similar to that observed with radiotherapy alone. The high CRs and bladder preservation rates observed deserve further clinical evaluation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions. RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an alpha/beta value of 3.7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated. CONCLUSION: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas	
555	Radiation therapy with charged particles. [Review] [57 refs]	Carbon, Germany, Head, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physics, Prostate, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy	Charged particle beams can offer an improved dose conformation to the target volume as compared with photon radiotherapy, with better sparing of normal tissue structures close to the target. In addition, beams of ions heavier than (4)He exhibit a strong increase of the linear energy transfer in the Bragg peak as compared with the entrance region. These physical and biological properties are much more favorable than in photon radiotherapy. As a consequence, particle therapy with protons and heavy ions has gained increasing interest worldwide, and many clinical centers are considering introducing radiation therapy with charged particles. This contribution summarizes the physical and technical principles of charged particle therapy with protons and heavy ions. It briefly reviews the clinical experience gathered so far with proton therapy and gives a more detailed summary of the recent results in carbon ion therapy of skull base tumors, head and neck tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, and prostate cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since January 1990, 97 patients with locally advanced carcinomas of the naso-, oro-, hypopharynx and the oral cavity in UICC stages III and IV were treated according to an accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy schedule with concurrent chemotherapy. The primary tumor and positive lymph nodes received a total dose of 72 Gy in 6 weeks. In the first 3 weeks, large fields were irradiated 5 times per week with 2 Gy per fraction. Thereafter, treatment was accelerated, giving 2 daily fractions of 1.4 Gy with minimal intervals of 6 hours. Target volumes were reduced after 49.6 and 59.4 Gy, excluding clinically uninvolved lymph node regions of low and high risk. On day 1, 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 50 mg/m2 folinic acid were given as intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion of 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 100 mg/m2 folinic acid, days 1 to 5. 10 mg/m2 mitomycin C was given on day 5 and 36 of the treatment. Salvage surgery was offered for residual disease 5 to 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Patient characteristics: 70 male, 27 female; age: 27 to 81 years; T2/T3/T4: 7/30/60; N0/N1/N2/N3: 20/18/53/6; nasopharynx/oropharynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity: 16/33/36/12. Median follow-up is 26 months. RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were 68 +/- 5% and 74 +/- 5%. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant influence of the geometric mean neck node diameter or the N-stage on loco-regional control and survival. T-stage, tumor volume, or tumor localisation did not become significant. Acute toxicity of this schedule was acceptable but required optimised supportive care. Treatment related grade 4+ late toxicity of mucosa, soft tissue and bone were observed with a cumulative frequency of 13% at 2 years. Two patients died during a phase of severe leuko- or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: This phase I to II trial shows favourable results using an intensified treatment radio-chemotherapy protocol. A phase III study is now planned, comparing this regime with an accelerated hyperfractionated radio-therapy alone to an increased total dose of 77.6 Gy

These complex situations give rise to problems and inaccuracies in both dosimetry and analytical/empirical dose calculation, and therefore require other than conventional methods. A natural diamond detector and a Markus parallel plate ionization chamber have been selected for clinical dosimetry in 6 MV photon beams. Results of simulations using the Monte Carlo system BEAM/EGS4 to model the beam geometry have been compared with dose measurements. A modification of the existing component module for multileaf collimators (MLCs) allowed the modeling of a linear accelerator SL 25 (Elekta Oncology Systems) equipped with a MLC with curved leaf-ends. A mechanical measurement method with spacer plates and a light-field edge detection technique are described as methods to obtain geometrical data of collimator openings for application in the Monte Carlo system. Generally a good agreement is found between measurements and calculations of depth dose distributions and deviations are typically less than 1%. Calculated lateral dose profiles slightly exceed measured dose distributions near the higher level of the penumbras for a 10x2 cm2 field, but agree well with the measurements for all other cases. The simulations are also able to predict variations of output factors and ratios of output factors as a function of field width and field-offset. The Monte Carlo results demonstrate that qualitative changes in energy spectra are too small to explain these variations and that especially geometrical factors affect the output factors and depth dose curves and profiles	
3159	Gallium-67 radiotoxicity in human U937 lymphoma cells	Cell Division/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Electrons, Energy Transfer, Gallium Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Gallium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphoma, Lymphoma,Large B-Cell,Diffuse/me [Metabolism], Lymphoma,Large B-Cell,Diffuse/pa [Pathology], Lymphoma,Large B-Cell,Diffuse/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplastic Stem Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Netherlands, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival, Tetrazolium Salts, Thiazoles, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities, Yttrium Radioisotopes, Yttrium Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Yttrium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use]	Promising clinical results have been obtained with radiolabeled antibodies in lymphoma patients. The higher uptake by lymphomas of 67Gallium (67Ga) compared with monoclonal antibodies makes selective radiotherapy by the widely available 67Ga appealing. However, the gamma radiation of 67Ga used in scintigraphy is considered to be almost non-toxic to lymphoma cells. However, in addition to photon radiation 67Ga emits low energy Auger electrons and 80-90 keV conversion electrons which could be cytotoxic. The objective of the present study was the assessment of radiotoxicity of 67Ga on a lymphoid cell line: U937. Proliferation (MTT-assay) and clonogenic capacity (CFU-assay) were measured after 3 and 6 days incubation with 10, 20 and 40 microCi ml-1 67Ga. Growth inhibition was 36% after 3 days incubation and 63% after 6 days incubation with 40 microCi 67Ga ml-1. Clonogenic capacity was reduced by 51% after 3 days and 72% after 6 days incubation with 40 microCi ml-1 67Ga. A survival curve showed an initial shoulder and became steeper beyond 200-250 pCi cell-1 (low linear energy transfer type). Iso-effect doses of 67Ga and 90Yttrium (90Y) were determined. The iso-effect dose of 40 microCi 67Ga ml-1 (cumulative dose of conversion electrons 306 cGy) was 2.5 microCi 90Y ml-1 (cumulative dose 494 cGy) and the iso-effect dose of 80 microCi 67Ga ml-1 was 5.0 microCi 90Y/ml. The main cytotoxic effect of 67Ga seems to be induced by the 80 keV conversion electrons. We conclude that the conversion electrons of 67Ga have a cytotoxic effect on U937 cells and that in our experiments a 16-fold higher microCi-dose of 67Ga than of 90Y was needed for the same cytotoxic effect. We believe that 67Ga holds promise for therapeutic use	
1931	[A multileaf collimator: additional quality assurance in a GE linear accelerator]. [German]	Equipment Design, Humans, Jaw, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Quality Control, Radiotherapy Dosage, Workload	BACKGROUND: In comparison to a conventional collimator, a multileaf collimator demands a great deal of quality assurance procedures due to its large number of leaves. A concept for daily quality assurance is presented, mainly concerning the positioning accuracy of the leaves. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two leaf configurations including maximal opening as well as overtravel of single leaves, at a maximal opening of the jaws, are transmitted online in daily exchange from our record- and verify system to the linac. Aiming at a special test phantom a visual control of the positioning accuracy is performed. The leaf positioning is documented by an electronic portal imaging system and is compared with a reference shot by superposition of a grid. RESULTS: This method of quality assurance offers a fast and effective possibility to guarantee the proper function of the whole system by simulating the routine treatment situation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a conventional collimator only a slightly greater workload is needed for quality assurance of a multileaf collimator	
118	Evaluation of lactate as a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy index for noninvasive prediction and early detection of tumor response to radiation therapy in EMT6 tumors	Animals, Female, Humans, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/me [Metabolism], Lactic Acid/an [Analysis], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Mice, Mice,Inbred BALB C, Mice,Inbred C3H, Neoplasms,Experimental/en [Enzymology], Neoplasms,Experimental/me [Metabolism], Neoplasms,Experimental/rt [Radiotherapy], Predictive Value of Tests, Protons, Research	In a recent study (Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 36, 635-639, 1996), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to demonstrate significant decreases in lactate levels after gamma irradiation of radiosensitive RIF-1 tumors in vitro. For comparison, we have examined the effects of gamma radiation on lactate levels in the more radioresistant EMT6 tumor. Single-slice (5-6 mm thick) localized 1H spectra of subcutaneous RIF-1 (untreated) and EMT6 tumors (pretreatment, 24 and 48 h postirradiation with 4, 10 or 20 Gy of gamma radiation) were measured by the selective multiple quantum coherence transfer method (Sel-MQC, approximately 4 min acquisition time). Both pretreatment lactate levels and pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were found to be similar in RIF-1 and EMT6 tumors, suggesting that steady-state lactate levels are unlikely to be reliable indices for predicting response to radiation therapy. After 10 Gy gamma irradiation, EMT6 tumors showed a 21% decrease relative to pretreatment lactate levels at 48 h (1.04 +/- 0.22 to 0.82 +/- 0.16; P = 0.06); after 20 Gy a 40% decrease was observed at 48 h (1.34 +/- 0.27 to 0.81 +/- 0.10; P = 0.07). No significant changes in lactate levels were observed in control EMT6 tumors or in tumors treated with 4 Gy of gamma radiation, in contrast to changes detected previously in RIF-1 tumors, which showed a significant decrease in lactate by 48 h for both 2 and 4 Gy. The decreased effect of radiation on lactate levels in EMT6 compared to RIF-1 tumors may be attributed to the higher hypoxic fraction and lower radiosensitivity of EMT6 tumors (Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 10, 695-712, 1984). The decrease in lactate levels did not, however, strictly reflect the extent of the response to therapy for the high dose of 20 Gy. This study together with our earlier study (Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 36, 635-639, 1996) provides evidence to support the hypothesis that changes in steady-state tumor lactate levels may serve as sensitive early indices of tumor response to gamma radiation at doses of the order of 2 to 4 Gy	
1790	A method for controlling image acquisition in electronic portal imaging devices	Biophysics, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Universities	Certain types of camera-based electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) which initiate image acquisition based on sensing a change in video level have been observed to trigger unreliably at the beginning of dynamic multileaf collimation sequences. A simple, novel means of controlling image acquisition with an Elekta linear accelerator (Elekta Oncology Systems, Crawley, UK) is proposed which is based on illumination of a photodetector (ORP-12, Silonex Inc., Plattsburgh, NY, USA) by the electron gun of the accelerator. By incorporating a simple trigger circuit it is possible to derive a beam on/off status signal which changes at least 100 ms before any dose is measured by the accelerator. The status signal does not return to the beam-off state until all dose has been delivered and is suitable for accelerator pulse repetition frequencies of 50-400 Hz. The status signal is thus a reliable means of indicating the initiation and termination of radiation exposure, and thus controlling image acquisition of such EPIDs for this application	
2088	The use of radiographic film for linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgical dosimetry	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Film Dosimetry/mt [Methods], Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, Uncertainty, Universities	The measurement of stereotactic radiosurgical dose distributions requires an integrating, high-resolution dosimeter capable of providing a spatial map of absorbed dose. Although radiographic film is an accessible dosimeter fulfilling these criteria, for larger radiotherapy photon fields the sensitivity of film emulsion exhibits significant dependencies on both depth in phantom and field size. We have examined the variation of film sensitivity over the ranges of depths and field sizes of interest in radiosurgery with a 6 MV photon beam. While for large (20cm x 20cm) fields the potential error in dose due to the variation of the film response with depth reaches 15%, the corresponding maximum error for a 2.5 cm diameter radiosurgical beam is 1.5%. This uncertainty was observed to be comparable in magnitude to that produced by variation in processing conditions (1.1%) and by varying the orientation of the film plane relative to the beam central axis (1.5%). The dependence of emulsion sensitivity on field size has been observed to be negligible for fields ranging in diameter from 1.0 cm to 4.0 cm. The source of the dependence of film sensitivity has been illustrated by using an EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation for large fields to illustrate significant increases in the photon spectrum below 400 keV with depth in phantom. In contrast, relative increase of this low-energy component is negligible for radiosurgical photon fields	
1793	Incorporating dynamic collimator motion in Monte Carlo simulations: an application in modelling a dynamic wedge	Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Physics, Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,Conformal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Time	In radiation therapy, new treatment modalities employing dynamic collimation and intensity modulation increase the complexity of dose calculation because a new dimension, time, has to be incorporated into the traditional three-dimensional problem. In this work, we investigated two classes of sampling technique to incorporate dynamic collimator motion in Monte Carlo simulation. The methods were initially evaluated for modelling enhanced dynamic wedges (EDWs) from Varian accelerators (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA). In the position-probability-sampling or PPS method, a cumulative probability distribution function (CPDF) was computed for the collimator position, which could then be sampled during simulations. In the static-component-simulation or SCS method, a dynamic field is approximated by multiple static fields in a step-shoot fashion. The weights of the particles or the number of particles simulated for each component field are computed from the probability distribution function (PDF) of the collimator position. The CPDF and PDF were computed from the segmented treatment tables (STTs) for the EDWs. An output correction factor had to be applied in this calculation to account for the backscattered radiation affecting monitor chamber readings. Comparison of the phase-space data from the PPS method (with the step-shoot motion) with those from the SCS method showed excellent agreement. The accuracy of the PPS method was further verified from the agreement between the measured and calculated dose distributions. Compared to the SCS method, the PPS method is more automated and efficient from an operational point of view. The principle of the PPS method can be extended to simulate other dynamic motions, and in particular, intensity-modulated beams using multileaf collimators	
3956	Electron-beam arc therapy using a high energy betatron	Air, Electrons, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation	Dose distributions in electron-beam arc therapy were investigated using the electron beam from a Brown Boveri 45 MeV betatron. This variable isocenter machine is equipped with an angular speed control device that synchronizes the radiation dose rate with the rotation speed about the isocenter. An Alderson Rando phantom was used with Kodak RP/V film to measure isodensity distributions that were then converted to isodose curves. The effects of varying field size, isocenter depth, and air gap between collimator and phantom were examined, along with changes in the dose distributions produced by wax bolus in part of the arc	
1902	A challenge for high-precision radiation therapy: the case for photons	Humans, Immobilization, Linear Energy Transfer, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research	The sophistication of Hadron facilities led to major technical and conceptual advances in the treatment immobilization, reproducibility, planning and execution. Some of these developments have had a pivotal impact on conventional treatments, which can now approach the dose localization advantage of protons in the majority of clinical situations. While the biological advantages of neutrons may finally be combined with excellent dose localization in Heavy Ion Facilities, modern surgical or systemic treatment methods may reduce high LET advantages. Clinical trials still need to define the relative merits of these approaches in their most modern implementation. The advantage gap has certainly been narrowed by recent developments in conventional therapy	
61	[Progress in optimizing dosimetry plans in stereotactic radiotherapy in the Salt Group (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon]. [French]	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/td [Trends], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	We began intracranial stereotactic irradiation under the direction of O Betti 11 years ago. At the present time, we believe it is interesting to present the methodologies of the SALT (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon) group. Up to the present time we have irradiated 693 patients using a single fraction. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represented the majority (90%) of treated lesions. Irradiation protocol has little changed since 1986, and the localization of the target volume was performed in the neurosurgery department of St Anne Hospital, France. The stereotactic images (computerized tomography [CT], angiography) were sent to the radiotherapy department of Tenon Hospital through the French public digital network NUMERIS. Protocol was realized using the stereotactic ARTEMIS-3D/Dosigray TPS. The lesion volume was filled by one or more spherical or elliptical subvolumes using the "Associated Target Methodology". The interactive adjustment of subvolumes was based on the 3D graphical representations of the lesion. The direct optimization of the irradiation space was performed by managing parameters provided by the DDB (Dosimetric Data Base) such as the number of arcs, their angular position, as well as the starting and the ending point of each arc. The evaluation of the calculated dose distribution was made using quantitative parameters. The second method of optimization was based on the minibeam intensity modulation using a mathematical theory of inverse problems and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. At the present time, due to technical reasons, linear accelerators do not permit the modulation of intensity of arctherapy. Thus we transformed the profiles of irregular forms into rectangular profiles of modulated ponderation, with each optimized plan being evaluated before its implementation. The criteria of evaluation were derived from the differential and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH). The DVHs permitted the evaluation of the volumes of underdosage and overdosage inside the lesion and in the healthy tissue, respectively. Using DVHs, we have defined parameters such as the conform factor and the homogeneity index. We stress that the methodology of protocol optimization is valid for single or multiple fractions as well as for intra- and extra-cranial irradiation

The former demands gamma--emitting radionuclides for labeling specific substrates for localizing malignant tissue and for analyzing tumor metabolism in vivo. Here, positron emission tomography (PET) may register in vivo the metabolism, for example, of glucose, amino acids, and receptors and of potentially useful cytotoxic agents. The advantage of the positron emitting radionuclides of carbon, nitrogen and fluorine is the labeling of substrates without changing substrate specificity within the metabolic reaction chain; also, substrate concentration in situ may be quantified. With regard to therapy radionuclides that emit beta- and alpha-particles or decay by electron capture with the Auger effect, are administered in ionic form or with tumor seeking substrates. Examples are radioiodine for treating thyroid malignancy and radiophosphorus for myeloproliferative diseases. Organically bound radionuclides are given as labeled ligands for specific receptors, such as meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) for treating the catecholamine producing tumors phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma and labeled monoclonal antibodies for tumors specific receptors. Highly localized energy depositions come from Auger emitters such as 125I and by the neutron capture therapy, where boron-10 in the tumor cell is exposed to thermal neutrons for initiating the B10 (n; alpha) Li7 reaction, especially for treating neuro- and glioblastoma and melanoma. Endogenous radiotherapy with radionuclides rely on the success of delivering a proper amount of energy into individual tumor cells with optimal protection of normal tissue. The inevitable heterogeneity of energy deposition events from such approaches demands careful dosimetric assessment for which the classical methods of dosimetry for percutaneous radiotherapy are not applicable

The clustering of DSB, probably determined by track structure as well as chromatin conformation, results in an excess of small- and intermediate-sized DNA fragments. DNA fragmentation in normal human fibroblasts (GM5758) was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after irradiation with photons (60Co) or 125 keV/micrometers nitrogen ions. Compared to conventional DSB analysis, i.e. assays only measuring the fraction of DNA smaller than a single threshold, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for DSB induction increased with 100%. Further, the size distribution of DNA fragments showed a significant dependence on radiation quality, with an excess of fragments up to 1 Mbp. Irradiation of naked genomic DNA without histone proteins increased the DSB yields 25 and 13 times for photons and nitrogen ions, respectively. The results suggest possible roles of both track structure and chromatin organization in the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks along the chromosome. c2002 COSPAR.

[Review] [12 refs] [Japanese]	Carbon, Dose Fractionation, Fast Neutrons, Female, Heavy Ions, Helium, Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Neon, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, X-Rays	Carbon ion beams have superior dose distribution allowing selective irradiation to the tumor while minimizing irradiation to the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions produce an increased density of local energy deposition with high-energy transfer (LET) components, resulting in radiobiological advantages. Stimulated by the favorable results in fast neutrons, helium ions, and neon ions, a clinical trial of carbon ion therapy was begun at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in 1994. Carbon ions were generated by a medically dedicated accelerator (HIMAC, Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan), which was the world's first heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. In general, patients were selected for treatment when their tumors could not be expected to respond favorably to conventional forms of therapy. A total of 1601 patients were registered in this clinical trial so far. The normal tissue reactions were acceptable, and there were no carbon related deaths. Carbon ion radiotherapy seemed to be a clinically feasible curative treatment modality, and appears to offer improved results not only over conventional X-rays but also even over surgery in some selected carcinomas.

522	Experimental evaluation of a MOSFET dosimeter for proton dose measurements	Biophysics, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Metals, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Semiconductors, Transistors	The metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) dosimeter has been widely studied for use as a dosimeter for patient dose verification. The major advantage of this detector is its size, which acts as a point dosimeter, and also its ease of use. The commercially available TN502RD MOSFET dosimeter manufactured by Thomson and Nielsen has never been used for proton dosimetry. Therefore we used the MOSFET dosimeter for the first time in proton dose measurements. In this study, the MOSFET dosimeter was irradiated with 190 MeV therapeutic proton beams. We experimentally evaluated dose reproducibility, linearity, fading effect, beam intensity dependence and angular dependence for the proton beam. Furthermore, the Bragg curve and spread-out Bragg peak were also measured and the linear-energy transfer (LET) dependence of the MOSFET response was investigated. Many characteristics of the MOSFET response for proton beams were the same as those for photon beams reported in previous papers. However, the angular MOSFET responses at 45, 90, 135, 225, 270 and 315 degrees for proton beams were over-responses of about 15%, and moreover the MOSFET response depended strongly on the LET of the proton beam. This study showed that the angular dependence and LET dependence of the MOSFET response must be considered very carefully for quantitative proton dose evaluations	
3488	Simulation with EGS4 code of external beam of radiotherapy apparatus with workstation and PC gives similar results?

The first implementation was run on a high performance RISC workstation, and the second was run on an inexpensive PC. The simulation was performed using the MCRAD user code. The photon energy spectra, as measured at a plane transverse to the beam direction and containing the isocenter, were compared. The photons were also binned radially in order to compare the variation of the spectra with radius. With 500,000 photons recorded in each of the two simulations, the running times were 48 h and 116 h for the workstation and the PC, respectively. No significant statistical differences between the two implementations were found

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children	
4557	DNA fragmentation induced in human fibroblasts by accelerated (56)fe ions of differing energies	Cell Line, DNA, DNA Damage, DNA Fragmentation, DNA Fragmentation/re [Radiation Effects], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Iron, Italy, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Research	DNA fragmentation was studied in the fragment size range 0.023-5.7 Mbp after irradiation of human fibroblasts with iron-ion beams of four different energies, i.e., 200 MeV/nucleon, 500 MeV/nucleon, 1 GeV/nucleon and 5 GeV/nucleon, with gamma rays used as the reference radiation. The double-strand break (DSB) yield (and thus the RBE for DNA DSB induction) of the four iron-ion beams, which have LETs ranging from 135 to 442 keV/mum, does not vary greatly as a function of LET. As a consequence, the variation of the cross section for DSB induction mainly reflects the variation in LET. However, when the fragmentation spectra were analyzed with a simple theoretical tool that we recently introduced, the results showed that spatially correlated DSBs, which are absent after gamma irradiation, increased markedly with LET for the iron-ion beams. This occurred because iron ions produce DNA fragments smaller than 0.75 Mbp with a higher probability than gamma rays (a probability that increases with LET). These sizes include those expected from fragmentation of the chromatin loops with Mbp dimensions. This result does not exclude a correlation at distances smaller than the lower size analyzed here, i.e. 23 kbp. Moreover, the DSB correlation is dependent on dose, decreasing when dose increases; this can be explained with the argument that at increasing dose there is an increasing fraction of fragments produced by DSBs caused by separate, uncorrelated tracks

3256	Feasibility study of multileaf collimated electrons with a scattering foil based accelerator	Electrons, Equipment Design, Feasibility Studies, Humans, Methods, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is an ever evolving process to improve the technical aspects of electron beam delivery. Both the foil/applicator and scanning electron beam systems have gone through recent upheavals. Concomitantly, multileaf collimators are now a staple method for collimating photons. We undertook a study of multileaf collimated electron beam (MLCEB) using a dual scattering foil system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared MLCEB with applicator collimated electron beams (AEB) by examining the dosimetric aspects of the two systems using 70 and 80 cm SSDs for the MLCEB, the minimum practical SSDs achievable. Percent depth dose, isodose profiles, output factors, leakage, surface dose, bremstrahlung, effective SSDs, etc. were measured using film and/or ion chamber. Clinical fields, such as posterior neck node (PNN), were compared. We also investigated the use of MLCEB for arc therapy using segments. RESULTS: In all cases, the MLCEB performed inferior, as judged by isodoses, uniformity index (UI) and penumbra analysis. The 80 cm SSD (minimum for PNN), low energy, small fields, was the worst case. For a 6 MeV beam, the UI/penumbra was 0.823/10 mm for the AEB, and 0.561/29 mm for the MLCEB at 80 cm SSD. The PNN multileaf fields exhibited narrow 90% and 80% isodose lines, and wide 20% and 10% lines. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that multileaf for PNN fields could not be matched to adjacent off-cord photon fields. The "stair-stepping' effect associated with MLC photons was absent for electrons	
2424	[Dose distribution of electrons obtained from linear accelerators equipped with a beam scanning system]. [German]	Diaphragm, Electrons, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Time	Homogeneous distribution of electrons used for therapeutic purposes and obtained from accelerators, is achieved by means of Potter-Bucky diaphragms or by repeated, staggered, sawtooth-shaped sweeping movements of the electron beam (scanning) over the radiation field. The repetition of the scanning process (number of scans) can result in long measurement times for achieving a sufficiently homogeneous, dosimetrically adequate distribution of the electrons. This "time problem" makes it imperative to achieve good homogeneity while keeping the number of scans as low as possible. To solve the problem, the scanning movement of the electron beam is simulated by a computer programme and the interdependence of the homogeneity of the irradiation field and number of scans is investigated. Since changing the ratio of the two deflection rates exercises a significant influence, it is mandatory in dosimetry to pay close attention to a strict observance of the deflection rates	
738	Spectrophotometric skin measurements correlate with EORTC/RTOG-common toxicity criteria	Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Color, Female, Germany, Humans, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Postmenopause, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Spectrophotometry	PURPOSE: It was investigated whether the elementary EORTC/RTOG-CTC score (Common Toxicity Criteria) for radiotherapy skin reactions correlates with spectrophotometric measurements of the skin color. PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: In 41 patients irradiated for unilateral breast cancer the regular scoring by CTC was done during radiotherapy. In parallel, a total of 4,920 spectrophotometric measurements to determine the skin color were performed at baseline, at the beginning of radiotherapy, and at 20, 40 and 60 Gy. The nonirradiated contralateral breast was used for control measurements. RESULTS: As expected, the skin color (especially red) depended on the radiation dose applied to the skin. The objective spectrophotometric measurements were found to correlate well with the subjective CTC scores. CONCLUSION: For classification of acute radiation toxicity there seems to be no need to replace the common CTC scoring by technical methods	
2311	A study of effective attenuation coefficient for calculating tissue compensator thickness	Humans, Ohio, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Technology,Radiologic, X-Rays	Dose uniformity throughout the treatment volume is essential to precision radiation therapy. Tissue compensators are often used as a means to eliminate dose nonuniformity resulting from surface contour irregularities. This paper evaluates the accuracy of using an effective attenuation coefficient for calculating the thickness of missing tissue. This coefficient is found to vary strongly with thickness of missing tissue when the initial depth is situated in the buildup region. The use of a single attenuation coefficient produces errors as high as 54% in the calculated compensator thickness when 10-MV x rays are used. At depths greater than the depth of maximum dose, the attenuation coefficient remains a function of field size, not the initial depth

Human autopsy data from both occupationally exposed persons and the public were relied on to determine the amount of Pu in the gonads. It was found that an average fraction of 3 X 10(-3) of the Pu in the body was in the ovaries and testes but there was a wide variation among individuals. While a localization factor over the average of 2.5-4 is needed to calculate the dose to the sensitive cells for rodents, no such factor is required for the human. Information on the RBE for various genetic effects shows RBEs for Pu alpha's about as would be expected from neutron irradiation. The usual quality factor applied in calculating dose equivalent is appropriate and may be conservative, particularly for females. [References: 32]

There is a lack of effective treatments for individuals with advanced disease. Many melanomas exhibit high levels of radioresistance. The direct consequence of gamma-irradiation for most melanoma cells is growth arrest at the G2-M phase of cell cycle. However, radiation-induced signaling pathways may affect numerous additional targets in cancer cells. We show in the present study that gamma-irradiation, as well as alpha-particle exposure, dramatically increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface TRAIL-receptor 1/receptor 2 (DR4/DR5) levels and to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface Fas levels. Additionally, increased dynamin-2 expression after irradiation is critically important in the translocation of death receptor to the cell surface. Moreover, sodium arsenite treatment may up-regulate expression of endogenous TRAIL and induces its translocation to cell surface and further down-regulates cFLIP levels in melanoma cells. We have evaluated the effects of sequential gamma-irradiation and arsenite treatment of melanoma cells for the induction of death signaling. Such treatment results in an efficient TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via a paracrine mechanism. These data highlight the efficacy of combined modality treatment involving radiation and arsenite in clinical management of this often fatal form of skin cancer	
3874	Wedge factor changes with depth and field size on a linear accelerator with a motorized wedge	Filtration/is [Instrumentation], Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Phantoms,Imaging/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], X-Rays	The wedge factor was experimentally determined as a function of field size and phantom depth for 6-MV X-rays; measurements were performed on a linear accelerator with a motorized wedge filter (universal wedge, nominal wedge angle = 60 degrees). As a result of our experimental work, we can state that: 1) The wedge factor increases linearly with phantom depth (0.275%/cm), almost independent of field size; this change was experimentally related to the beam "hardening" caused by the high Z value of wedge material, as shown by the increase in wedged-field PDD with respect to the corresponding open-field PDD. Neglecting this variation can induce systematic errors in delivered dose, especially when deep-seated tumors are treated with wedge fields. 2) The wedge factor changes, for rectangular fields, according to the "equivalent square law", and not to the dimension in the wedged direction	
3666	Shaped field electron dosimetry for a Philips SL75/10 linear accelerator	Electrons, Eye, Humans, Lead, Models,Structural, Nose, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Radiotherapy Dosage	Both small and irregular fields are frequently the treatment of choice in many clinical applications of electron therapy. The fields are often shaped by lead or low melting point alloy placed at the end of the cone or on the patient's surface. The dosimetry for electrons of energies of 4, 6, 8, and 10 MeV is examined with particular emphasis on very small fields for treatment such as the lip, nose, and eye and irregular fields of various area/perimeter ratios. The paper discusses the dosimetry correction due to field shaping as a function of the location of the shield	
4476	Radiographic changes following radiotherapy in the patients with lung cancer. Is the irradiated area of the mediastinum in the simulation film a significant factor?	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/dt [Drug Therapy], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Small Cell/dt [Drug Therapy], Carcinoma,Small Cell/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Small Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Incidence, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Lung Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/in [Injuries], Lung/ra [Radiography], Male, Mediastinum, Mediastinum/re [Radiation Effects], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/mo [Mortality], Radiation Injuries/ra [Radiography], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Regression Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	BACKGROUND: Radiation induced lung injury is an ominous adverse reaction in the management of thoracic disease by radiation therapy. Although the importance of the area of irradiated lung is well known, the irradiated area of mediastinum is little to be considered in the routine treatment. PURPOSE: To evaluate the significance of the irradiated area of the mediastinum in the simulation film for radiation induced lung injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients with primary lung cancer treated with radiation therapy were analyzed for incidence of radiation induced lung injury. Lung injury was defined as the appearance of an abnormal shadow on the chest radiograph. CT images were used to differentiate recurrence or other conditions. Age, sex, irradiation dose, irradiated lung area, T and N factors of the tumor, irradiated mediastinum area, performance status of patients, location of irradiated fields and use of chemotherapy were analyzed with Cox's multivariate regression model. RESULTS: The cumulative rate of radiation induced lung injury at 12 months was 85%. Significant factor of radiation induced lung injury was irradiated area of the mediastinum (p = 0.03). Irradiated area of the lung (p = 0.18, n.s.), total tumor dose (p = 0.1, n.s.), use of chemotherapy (p = 0.08, n.s.) and location of irradiated field (p = 0.08, n.s.) may also have an effect on radiation induced lung injury. CONCLUSION: The irradiated area of the mediastinum is one of the significant factors in radiation induced lung injury

4492	Macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation. 10-year follow-up observation with histopathologic correlation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/pa [Pathology], Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Risk, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Although patients with choroidal melanoma within 3 mm of both the optic nerve and fovea are at higher risk for visual loss after proton beam irradiation, half of the patients in this study with visual acuity better than 20/200 before treatment maintained this level of vision for at least 2 years. Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation	
4570	DNA DSB induced in human cells by charged particles and gamma rays: experimental results and theoretical approaches	Alpha Particles, Cells,Cultured, Computer Simulation, DNA, DNA Damage, DNA Fragmentation, DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/ch [Chemistry], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Humans, Ions, Italy, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Methods, Models,Biological, Models,Chemical, Molecular Weight, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research	PURPOSE: To quantify the role played by radiation track structure and background fragments in modulating DNA fragmentation in human cells exposed to gamma-rays and light ions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human fibroblasts were exposed in vitro to different doses (in the range from 40 - 200 Gy) of (60)Co gamma-rays and 0.84 MeV protons (Linear Energy Transfer, LET, in tissue 28.5 keV/microm). The resulting DNA fragments were scored under two electrophoretic conditions, in order to optimize separation in the size ranges 0.023 - 1.0 Mbp and 1.0 - 5.7 Mbp. In parallel, DNA fragmentation was simulated both with a phenomenological approach based on the "generalized broken-stick" model, and with a mechanistic approach based on the PARTRAC (acronym of PARticle TRACk) Monte Carlo code (1.32 MeV photons were used for the simulation of (60)Co gamma-rays). RESULTS: For both gamma-rays and protons, the experimental dose response in the range 0.023 - 5.7 Mbp could be approximated as a straight line, the slope of which provided a yield of (5.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-9) Gy(-1) bp(-1) for gamma-rays and (7.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(-9) Gy(-1) bp(-1) for protons, leading to a Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of 1.3 +/- 0.2. From both theoretical analyses it appeared that, while gamma-ray data were consistent with double-strand breaks (DSB) random induction, protons at low doses showed significant deviation from randomness, implying enhanced production of small fragments in the low molecular weight part of the experimental range. The theoretical analysis of fragment production was then extended to ranges where data were not available, i.e. to fragments larger than 5.7 Mbp and smaller than 23 kbp. The main outcome was that small fragments (<23 kbp) are produced almost exclusively via non-random processes, since their number is considerably higher than that produced by a random insertion of DSB. Furthermore, for protons the number of these small fragments is a significant fraction (about 20%) of the total number of fragments; these fragments remain undetected in these experiments. Calculations for 3.3 MeV alpha particle irradiation (for which no experimental data were available) were performed to further investigate the role of fragments smaller than 23 kbp; in this case, besides the non-random character of their production, their number resulted to be at least as much as half of the total number of fragments. CONCLUSION: Comparison between experimental data and two different theoretical approaches provided further support to the hypothesis of an important role of track structure in modulating DNA damage. According to the theoretical approaches, non-randomness of fragment production was found for proton irradiation for the smaller fragments in the experimental size range and, in a significantly larger extent, for fragments of size less than 23 kbp, both for protons and alpha particles

So far over 15,000 patients have been treated worldwide with two major indications: conservative management of ocular melanomas in which local control exceeds 95% at 5 years and curative irradiation of sarcomas at the base of the skull and cervical canal, with a survival rate between 84 and 94% at 5 years. The different protocols tested currently worldwide are discussed	
4646	Number of Fe ion traversals through a cell nucleus for mammalian cell inactivation near the bragg peak	Animals, Cell Nucleus/ph [Physiology], Cell Nucleus/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], CHO Cells, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, DNA, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Hela Cells, Humans, Ions, Iron, Iron Radioisotopes, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer/ph [Physiology], Radiation Dosage, Radioisotopes, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Research, Science, Survival, Universities	HeLa and CHO-K1 cells were irradiated with Fe ions (1.14 MeV/nucleon) near the Bragg peak to determine how many ion traversals through a cell nucleus are necessary to induce cell inactivation. The ion traversals through a cell nucleus were visualized by immunostaining the phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX), as an indicator of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), to confirm that DSBs are actually induced along every Fe ion traversal through the nucleus. The survival curves after irradiation with Fe ions decreased exponentially with the ion fluence without a shoulder. The inactivation cross sections calculated from the slope of the survival curves and the standard errors were 96.9 +/- 1.8 and 57.9 +/- 5.4 microm2 for HeLa and CHO-K1 cells, respectively, corresponding to 0.442 and 0.456 of the mean value of each cell nucleus area. Taking the distribution of the cell nucleus area into consideration with an equation proposed by Goodhead et al. (1980), which calculates the average number of lesions per single ion track through the average area of a sensitive organelle (mainly nucleus), these two ratios were converted to 0.705 and 0.659 for HeLa and CHO-K1 cells, respectively. These ratios were less than one, suggesting that the average numbers of lethal hits per cell produced by a single ion traversal were less than one. We thus considered two possible explanations for ion traversals of more than one, necessary for cell inactivation

We evaluated whether L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake and its change after CIRT were the early survival predictors in patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MET positron emission tomography was prospectively performed in 62 patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas before and within 1 month after CIRT. Tumor MET uptake was measured with the semiquantitative tumor:nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). The MET uptake in the tumor and relevant clinical parameters were entered into univariate and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 20 months. Patients with a baseline T/N ratio of <or=6 had a significant better survival than patients with a baseline T/N ratio >6 (2-year survival rate: 69.4% versus 32.3%; P = 0.01). Patients with a post-CIRT ratio of <or=4.4 had a better survival than that with a post-CIRT ratio >4.4 (2-year survival rate: 63.7% versus 41.3%; P = 0.01). A significant higher survival rate was observed in patients with post-therapeutic MET uptake change of >30% than patients in lower change group (2-year survival rate: 74.6% versus 41.6%; P = 0.049). The multivariate analysis showed that both baseline and post-CIRT T/N ratio were statistically significant independent predictors of patient survival. Tumors with larger T/N ratio had a significantly poorer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: MET uptake as measured by either baseline or post-CIRT T/N ratio was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherapy, whereas post-therapeutic MET uptake change might have potential value for the same purpose	
4697	DAVID--a translucent multi-wire transmission ionization chamber for in vivo verification of IMRT and conformal irradiation techniques	Germany, Humans, Light, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Photons, Physics, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Reference Values	Permanent in vivo verification of IMRT photon beam profiles by a radiation detector with spatial resolution, positioned on the radiation entrance side of the patient, has not been clinically available so far. In this work we present the DAVID system, which is able to perform this quality assurance measurement while the patient is treated. The DAVID system is a flat, multi-wire transmission-type ionization chamber, placed in the accessory holder of the linear accelerator and constructed from translucent materials in order not to interfere with the light field. Each detection wire of the chamber is positioned exactly in the projection line of a MLC leaf pair, and the signal of each wire is proportional to the line integral of the ionization density along this wire. Thereby, each measurement channel essentially presents the line integral of the ionization density over the opening width of the associated leaf pair. The sum of all wire signals is a measure of the dose-area product of the transmitted photon beam and of the total radiant energy administered to the patient. After the dosimetric verification of an IMRT plan, the values measured by the DAVID system are stored as reference values. During daily treatment the signals are re-measured and compared to the reference values. A warning is output if there is a deviation beyond a threshold. The error detection capability is a leaf position error of less than 1 mm for an isocentric 1 cm x 1 cm field, and of 1 mm for an isocentric 20 cm x 20 cm field

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel	
301	Accelerators for heavy-charged-particle radiation therapy	Carbon, Cyclotrons, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Equipment Design, Facility Design and Construction, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Respiration, Synchrotrons, United States	This paper focuses on current and future designs of medical hadron accelerators for treating cancers and other diseases. Presently, five vendors and several national laboratories have produced heavy-particle medical accelerators for accelerating nuclei from hydrogen (protons) up through carbon and oxygen. Particle energies are varied to control the beam penetration depth in the patient. As of the end of 2006, four hospitals and one clinic in the United States offer proton treatments; there are five more such facilities in Japan. In most cases, these facilities use accelerators designed explicitly for cancer treatments. The accelerator types are a combination of synchrotrons, cyclotrons, and linear accelerators; some carry advanced features such as respiration gating, intensity modulation, and rapid energy changes, which contribute to better dose conformity on the tumor when using heavy charged particles. Recent interest in carbon nuclei for cancer treatment has led some vendors to offer carbon-ion and proton capability in their accelerator systems, so that either ion can be used. These features are now being incorporated for medical accelerators in new facilities	
2296	The dependency of wedge factors on field size and depth in megavoltage beams	Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, India, Methods, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	AIM: To investigate the variation of wedge factors on field size, depth on 2 types of telecobalt units and 3 types of medical linear accelerators and to make a simplified approach for day to day calculation procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 0.125 cm3 ion chamber was used to determine the wedge factors which is connected to the computer controlled radiation field analyser. The wedge factors were determined for field sizes varying from 5 x 5 cm to the maximum square field size available for each wedge angles and at multiple depths upto 25 cm of respective teletherapy units. The results obtained are fitted to a second degree polynomial function. RESULTS: There is no significant variation of wedge factor on field size for all the 3 linear accelerators. The wedge factors are found to vary mainly at larger depths and wedge angles. The variation of wedge factors for 2 types of cobalt units were similar and increase of 3%, 4% and 5.5% is observed for wedge angles 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees respectively with respect of depth of maximum build-up. The trend was similar for linear accelerators with maximum increase in wedge factor up to 7.5% for 60 degrees wedge angle at 25 cm depth for 6 MV photon beams. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The determination of wedge factors at various field sizes and depths is essential to ensure accurate dose delivery. With experimental wedge data fitted with second degree polynomial function is a simplified and alternative method which can be adopted for routine dosimetric calculations

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84% and 77%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS	
1826	[The role of intraoperative radiotherapy in oncological pediatric surgery]. [Spanish]	Adolescent, Child, Child,Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Intraoperative Care, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Risk	Conventional external beam radiation has proved its profit in pediatric tumors; but its complications have limited it in therapeutical approach. Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases	
4624	Proton or stereotactic photon irradiation for posterior uveal melanoma? A planning intercomparison	Berlin, Eye Injuries/et [Etiology], Eye Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Fovea Centralis, Germany, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Methods, Optic Disk, Optic Nerve, Patients, Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Safety, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton and stereotactic radiotherapy with photons (SRT) are both used to treat choroidal melanomas in proximity to optic disk and fovea centralis, a situation where plaque therapy is prone to complications. A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated	
1945	Quality assurance for a treatment planning system in scanned ion beam therapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Germany, Humans, Phantoms,Imaging, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Safety, Software, Uncertainty, Water	Conformal radiation therapy using dynamic beam delivery systems like scanned ion beams requires concise quality assurance procedures for the complete treatment planning process. For the heavy ion therapy facility at GSI, Darmstadt, a quality assurance program for the treatment planning system (TPS) has been developed. It covers the development and updating of software, data protection and safety, and the application of soft- and hardware. The tests also apply to the geometrical precision of imaging devices and the geometrical and dosimetrical verification of dose distributions in different phantoms. The quality assurance program addresses acceptance and constancy tests of the treatment planning program. Results of the acceptance tests served as a basis for its governmental approval. Two main results of the acceptance tests are representative for the overall performance of the system. (1) The geometrical uncertainty that could be achieved for the target point definition, setup accuracy, field contouring, and field alignment is typically 1.5 mm. The uncertainty for the setup verification using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR's) is limited to 2 mm. (2) The mean deviations between measured and planned dose values is 3% for standardized cases in a water phantom and up to 6% for more complicated treatment configurations

Prolactin concentrations reduced both in macro- and microprolactinomas patients. The response was achieved in 96% of the cases in adenoma stages I-IIIa. Such results are superior to those reached with other treatment modalities. The efficacy of the above proton treatment can be raised by adjuvant use of chemotherapy	
2788	Chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by U-235 fission neutrons. Part III: Evaluation of the effect of the induced alpha and beta activity on the chromosomal aberration yield	Alpha Particles, Beta Rays, Cells,Cultured, Chromosome Aberrations, Female, Humans, Isotopes, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Neutrons, Neutrons/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Research, Time, Time Factors, Uranium, Uranium/ae [Adverse Effects]	AIM: Further experiments were performed to explain a difference in chromosomal aberration yield found between samples cultivated immediately after fission neutron irradiation and samples which were cultivated with 96 h delay after irradiation. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Human peripheral blood samples were irradiated in mixed fission neutron/gamma field (1800 s) and biological effect assessed in the mean of analysis of unstable chromosome aberrations with a time delay in culturing cells of 12, 24, 48, and 96 h. Additional measurements were performed on irradiated and blank blood samples with the aim to detect any increase in alpha and beta activity after fission neutron irradiation. No difference was found. Results were compared to theoretically calculated values of the alpha and beta activity released from natural radioactive isotopes. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: As a conclusion it is shown that in our experimental conditions the secondary effects resulting from nuclear transformations of natural or induced radioactive isotopes, recoil reactions and accompanying alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are not the reason for the increase observed in chromosomal aberration yield in blood samples cultured with a time delay of at least 24 hours	
3630	[Present status of high LET radiation therapy--fast neutron radiotherapy in Japan]. [Review] [16 refs] [Japanese]	Adenocarcinoma, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Lung, Melanoma, Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Sarcoma, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Soft Tissue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	More than 1,900 patients of advanced and inoperable malignant tumor were treated with fast neutron radiotherapy using 30 MeV (d-Be) and 14 MeV (d-Be) beams at NIRS and IMS between 1975 and 1986. Protocols were largely nonrandomized. Some results have been obtained: 1) results with mixed beam studies for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix have been equivocal compared with the photon controls. 2) some trends of local control have been observed in the trial of esophageal cancer, early cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung and malignant melanoma. 3) significant better results were observed in the pancoast type lung cancer and osteo sarcoma which was treated by the systemic multimodal treatment. It is concluded that neutrons are efficacious for certain specific tumor types owing to some biological effects, however the problem of inferior dose distribution was the weakness of neutron therapy at present.

2330	RBE-LET relationships for different types of lethal radiation damage in mammalian cells: comparison with DNA dsb and an interpretation of differences in radiosensitivity. [Review] [23 refs]	Animals, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], DNA, DNA Damage, Energy Transfer, Humans, Lead, Linear Energy Transfer, Netherlands, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance, Radiobiology, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Survival, Universities	Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), as a function of linear energy transfer (LET), is evaluated for different types of damage contributing to mammalian cell reproductive death. Survival curves are analysed assuming a linear-quadratic dose dependence of lethal lesions. The linear term represents lethal damage due to single particle tracks, the quadratic term represents lethality due to interaction of lesions from independent tracks. RBE-LET relationships of single-track lethal damage, sublethal damage, potentially lethal damage and DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) are compared. Single-track lethal damage is shown to be composed of two components: damage that remains unrepaired in an interval between irradiation and assay, characterized by a very strong dependence on LET, with RBEs up to 20, and potentially lethal damage, which is weakly dependent on LET with RBEs < 3. Potentially lethal damage and sublethal damage depend similarly on LET as DNA dsb. The identification of these different components of damage leads to an interpretation of differences in radiosensitivity and in RBEs among various types of cells. [References: 23]	
1242	Guidance document on delivery, treatment planning, and clinical implementation of IMRT: report of the IMRT Subcommittee of the AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee	Algorithms, Humans, Knowledge, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology/ed [Education], Radiation Oncology/mt [Methods], Radiology/ed [Education], Radiology/mt [Methods], Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Risk, Uncertainty	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) represents one of the most significant technical advances in radiation therapy since the advent of the medical linear accelerator. It allows the clinical implementation of highly conformal nonconvex dose distributions. This complex but promising treatment modality is rapidly proliferating in both academic and community practice settings. However, these advances do not come without a risk. IMRT is not just an add-on to the current radiation therapy process; it represents a new paradigm that requires the knowledge of multimodality imaging, setup uncertainties and internal organ motion, tumor control probabilities, normal tissue complication probabilities, three-dimensional (3-D) dose calculation and optimization, and dynamic beam delivery of nonuniform beam intensities. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to guide and assist the clinical medical physicist in developing and implementing a viable and safe IMRT program. The scope of the IMRT program is quite broad, encompassing multileaf-collimator-based IMRT delivery systems, goal-based inverse treatment planning, and clinical implementation of IMRT with patient-specific quality assurance. This report, while not prescribing specific procedures, provides the framework and guidance to allow clinical radiation oncology physicists to make judicious decisions in implementing a safe and efficient IMRT program in their clinics	
3425	Chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by neutron irradiation	Cell Survival, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Effects, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage	In vitro dose--response curves of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes have been obtained for neutron spectra of mean energies 0-7, 0-9, 7-6 and 14-7 MeV. The aberration yields have been fitted to the quadratic function Y = alphaD + betaD2, which is consistent with the single-track and two-track model of aberration formation. However with high-LET radiation, the linear component of yield, corresponding to damage caused by single tracks, predominants, and this term becomes more dominant with increasing LET, so that for fission spectrum neutrons the relationship is linear, Y = alphaD. At low doses, such as those recieved by radiation workers, limiting r.b.e. values between 13 and 47 are obtained relative to 60Co gamma-radiation. At higher doses, as used in radiotherapy, the values are much lower; ranging from 2-7 to 8 at 200 rad of equivalent gamma-radiation. Both sets of r.b.e. values correlate well with track-averaged LET but not with dose-averaged LET. When the numbers of cells without aberrations are plotted against radiation dose, curves are obtained which are similar in shape to those for conventional cell-survival experiments with comparable neutron spectra. The Do values obtained in the present study are close to those from other cell system	
2172	Phacoemulsification following treatment of choroidal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Berlin, Brachytherapy, Cataract Extraction, Choroid Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Eye Enucleation, Germany, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Lens Implantation,Intraocular, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Phacoemulsification, Postoperative Care, Postoperative Complications, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Retreatment, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risks, effects and results of phacoemulsification following treatment with different modalities of choroidal melanoma. METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery	
3194	Distribution and dosimetry of Thorotrast in USUR case 1001	Aged, Autopsy, Bone and Bones/me [Metabolism], Bone Marrow, Carotid Arteries, Contrast Media, Female, Humans, Liver, Particle Size, Radioactivity, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Registries, Research, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ad [Administration & Dosage], Thorium Dioxide/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Time Factors, Tissue Distribution, Universities, Uranium, Washington	The distribution of radioactivity and the associated doses were evaluated postmortem for USUR Case 1001, a female who had been injected with Thorotrast some 36 y prior to death. The distribution was determined for four nuclides: 232Th and its decay products, 228Ra and 228Th; and 230Th, a contaminant associated with Thorotrast. More than 90% of the activity was associated with the reticuloendothelial system. Approximately 32% of the total activity was found in the total skeleton (mineral bone and bone marrow), which is somewhat higher than expected from the literature. The 44% found in the liver and 12% in the spleen were somewhat lower than expected. This difference may be attributable, in part, to the initial deposition as influenced by colloidal particle size and to the radiation-induced hyposplenism, splenic atrophy, and slight hepatic atrophy observed at autopsy. In addition, roughly 3% of the activity was found in the Thorotrastoma and surrounding carotid artery tissue. Estimated lifetime absorbed doses from the 232Th series were 15 Gy to the liver, 121 Gy to the spleen, 4 Gy to the skeleton, and 16 Gy to the Thorotrastoma. Comparable dose equivalents to these tissues are 300, 2420, 80, and 320 Sv, respectively, assuming a quality factor of 20 for alpha irradiation

The technique involved design of complexes provided with the sources of fast neutrons based on beryllium, gas deuterium and beryllium-deuterium targets. The spectrometry and dosimetry measurements of collimated bunches of fast neutrons have shown that the mean energies of neutrons from beryllium and gas deuterium targets are 6.0 and 11.5 MeV, while the absorbed doses are 0.8 and 0.5 sGy/min X microA. The increase of the local power of the biological dose inside the phantom irradiated by the collimated bunch of fast neutrons is shown to be due to intermediate energy neutrons, the contribution of which to the spectrum of fast neutrons increases with the decrease of their mean energy. The problems of selection of the sources of fast neutrons for neutron therapy are discussed

We used a Monte Carlo algorithm with a random-walk geometry of chromatin, and a track structure defined by the radial distribution of energy deposition from an incident ion, to fit the PFGE data for fragment-size distribution after high-dose irradiation. These fits determined the unknown parameters of the model, enabling the extrapolation of data for high-dose irradiation to the low doses that are relevant for NASA space radiation research. The randomly-located-clusters formalism was used to speed the simulations. It was shown that only one adjustable parameter, Q, the track efficiency parameter, was necessary to predict DNA fragment sizes for wide ranges of doses. This parameter was determined for a variety of radiations and LETs and was used to predict the DSB patterns at the HPRT locus of the human X chromosome after low-dose irradiation. It was found that high-LET radiation would be more likely than low-LET radiation to induce additional DSBs within the HPRT gene if this gene already contained one DSB

[Italian]	Adult, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Graves Disease/th [Therapy], Humans, Immunoglobulins,Intravenous/ad [Administration & Dosage], Immunoglobulins,Intravenous/ae [Adverse Effects], Male, Methylprednisolone/ad [Administration & Dosage], Methylprednisolone/ae [Adverse Effects], Middle Aged, Orbit, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction	The most frequently used medical treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy is the combination of orbital irradiation and systemic corticosteroid. In this study the effectiveness of "high dose intravenous immunoglobulin" (IVIG) in Graves' ophthalmopathy treatment is explored. 11 patients were treated with orbital radiotherapy combined with systemic corticosteroid (Group 1), while 10 patients were treated with the combination of orbital irradiation and IVIG (Group 2). The therapeutic effect was assessed by an ophthalmopathy index based on the American Thyroid Association, classification of ocular changes of Graves' ophthalmopathy. All signs and symptoms of endocrine ophthalmopathy improved significantly in both groups. The mean ophthalmopathy index decreased from 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 3.4 +/- 1.5 in Group 1, and from 7.0 +/- 1.8 to 3.0 +/- 2.1 in Group 2. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between Group 1 and 2 mean initial and final ophthalmopathy index, and a significant difference between initial and final ophthalmopathy index both in Group 1 and 2. While side effects were present in Group 1 treated with systemic corticosteroid, no side effect was observed in patients treated with IVIG. These preliminary results suggest that IVIG is safe and effective in the treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy

Conventional radioprotectors are generally effective only during a single irradiation and display their radioprotective properties only at high, toxic concentrations. In addition, they reduce somatic radiation effects but are poorly efficient in protecting from hereditary stochastic radiation effects. In this respect, the pigment melanin merits attention. Experiments referring to potential melanin effects on the ionising radiation response have been carried out with different biological systems, both in vivo and in vitro. In this paper, we present results on the response to high- and low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation of a human mammary epithelial cell line, H184B5 F5-1 M/10, supplemented by melanin. The incorporation of auto-oxidative (L-dopa) melanin was linear for concentrations from 3 to 10 micrograms/ml in the growth medium. Concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml did not significantly impair the cells proliferative ability. No significant protective effect of melanin on the survival of cultured cells after exposure to alpha-particles (130 keV/micron) or x-rays was observed	
3486	Measurement of the restricted linear energy transfer of stray radiation close to the treatment volume of 12 and 18 MeV clinical photon beams	Energy Transfer, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Universities	The restricted dose mean linear energy transfer (LET) (L500,D) of the stray radiation field a few centimeters outside the treatment volume has been measured for 12 and 18 MV photons produced by a clinical Therac-20 (AECL) accelerator. The measurements were performed as a function of field size and distance from the edge of the treatment volume, using the method of the high-pressure ionization chamber. Contrary to what was found in a previous investigation for a clinical Co-60 unit and despite the presence of photoneutrons (in the case of 18 MV photons), the L500,D outside the beam does not increase significantly relative to the L500,D of the primary beam

Clinical presentation is related to local invasion. Lesion of the body of the clivus can extend ventrally or dorsally and cause cranial nerve palsies, brain stem compression or hydrocephalus. Pathologically, they form soft, grey masses that are histologically benign but locally invasive and destructive. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging clearly depict the lesion. CT better demonstrates bone destruction and intralesional calcifications. In our case, MR was performed first and showed all the classical signs of skull base chordoma. CT provided complementary information about bone destruction which are also usual in this type of lesion. Major differential diagnoses of the chordoma in the clivus are the other central skull base masses. Biopsy and histology make the diagnosis. Usually treatment consists in surgery and radiotherapy but more recently proton beam therapy is used and seems to yield better results

Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity

The new methods of therapy based on biological priniciples have been introduced within last decade. The monoclonal antibody rituximab was launched ten years ago in 1997. This antibody against CD20 antigen, which is expressed on B cell lymphocytes and on the majority of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, has revolutionized the lymphoma therapeutic strategy. The immuno-chemotherapy has dramatically improved the outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas patients. The combination of rituximab and chemotherapy as first line therapy has for the first time improved the survival of follicular lymphoma patients previously considered to be incurable. Rituximab has become the inevitable part of therapeutic regimens for other B-cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia as well as for some non-malignant diseases. The important milestones, the therapeutic results of rituximab and other approved monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab, ibritumomab tiuxetan 90Y) is reviewed in this paper as well as short compendium of new antibodies is given. The cost effectiveness of the new therapy is discussed. [References: 65]

Cataractogenous effectiveness of fast neutrons, accelerated ions of carbon, helium, neon and argon with the energy of 300 MeV/nucleon, and 137Cs gamma-radiation was compared. Analysis of the incidence of opacity of the lens in consequence of low doses gave high RBE estimates (from 10 to 40). The extremely high cataractogenous effectiveness of accelerated ions makes on thing that the existent space radiation limits, particularly in part of the GCR effects on the lens and permissible doses for cosmonauts, should be reconsidered towards mitigation. The authors discuss issues of threshold radiation doses that do not markedly increase incidence and rate of the lens opacity development in the post-exposure period. [References: 18]

Over 100 patients were treated using this system, which is fitted to a Clinac 600C linac. Both cranial and extracranial lesions have been treated using this modality. Immobilization is achieved either with the Talon system for cranial sites or an Aquaplast cast. Target volumes up to 500 cm3 have been treated. Multiple lesions (up to 3) were treated in one setup. The range of dose/fractionation schemes used was 15 Gy/1 fx (radiosurgical treatment) - 80 Gy/40 fx. Dose validation studies were carried out using film and ion chamber dosimetry in a specially designed phantom. Optimal dose distributions were attainable using inverse treatment planning for IMRT delivery. These were found to encompass the target volumes accurately using dose validation phantom studies. Immobilization methods used were accurate to within 1 mm, as evidenced by daily portal films. IMRT using the Peacock system offers the advantage of delivery of conformal therapy to high doses safely and accurately. This provides the opportunity for dose escalation studies, retreatment of previously treated tumors, as well as treating multiple targets in one setup. The system may be fitted to a conventional linac without major modifications	
1593	Inactivation of human cells exposed to fractionated doses of low energy protons: relationship between cell sensitivity and recovery efficiency	Biophysics, Cell Line, Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Humans, Italy, Protons, Radiation, Research, Survival	Within the framework of radiation biophysics research in the hadrontherapy field, split-dose studies have been performed on four human cell lines with different radiation sensitivity (SCC25, HF19, H184B5 F5-1 M10, and SQ20B). Low energy protons of about 8 and 20 keV/micron LET and gamma-rays were used to study the relationship between the recovery ratio and the radiation quality. Each cell line was irradiated with two dose values corresponding to survival levels of about 5% and 1%. The same total dose was also delivered in two equal fractions separated by 1.5, 3, and 4.5 hours. A higher maximum recovery ratio was observed for radiosensitive cell lines as compared to radioresistant cells. The recovery potential after split doses was small for slow protons, compared to low-LET radiation. These data show that radiosensitivity may not be related to a deficient recovery, and suggest a possible involvement of inducible repair mechanisms

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision

1937	Proton radiation therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base. [Review] [35 refs]	Carbon, Chondrosarcoma/mo [Mortality], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Disease Progression, Female, Germany, Humans, Ions, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Rate, Time, United States, Universities	Most patients with conventional radiotherapy after surgery die with local disease progression. The superior local tumor control and overall survival achieved with fractionated proton RT can be attributed to improved dose localization characteristics of protons, resulting in higher doses delivered. Patients with base of skull neoplasms are increasingly considered for stereotactic radiosurgery. Recently, Muthukumar et al reported for the University of Pittsburgh group on cobalt-60 Gamma Knife (Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA) therapy for 15 patients with chordomas or chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. With tumor volumes ranging between 0.98 and 10.3 mL (mean, 4.6 mL), doses to the tumor margin varying from 12 to 20 Gy (median, 18 Gy) were delivered. Two patients were treated without histologic tumor confirmation. After a median follow-up time of 40 months, 2 patients had died of disease, 2 patients had succumbed to intercurrent disease, and 1 patient surviving at the time of analysis had developed tumor progression. Neither actuarial local control nor actuarial survival data were presented. In the LLUMC series, most tumors exceeded sizes reportedly suitable for radiosurgery or were of a highly irregular configuration. Nevertheless, in 11 patients, tumors less than 15 mL in size remained locally controlled as did tumors sized between 15 and 25 mL in 11 additional patients; these patients were thus potential candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery. At present, too few reports on radiosurgery contain sufficient patient numbers and statistical analyses to permit one to draw conclusions about the feasibility of radiosurgery for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. A principal difference between proton RT and radiosurgery as currently practiced in most centers concerns target definition. In proton RT, the GTV is treated. In addition, a clinical volume is defined, which is distinctly different from the GTV in size and shape, to include the operative site and other areas of microscopic risk. In many instances, only the GTV is targeted in radiosurgery. Although it is certainly appropriate to explore the role that radiosurgical techniques may have in treating these tumors, results should be evaluated against the excellent outcome that can be achieved with fractionated proton RT, particularly in patients with tumors small enough and of favorable configuration and location to make them candidates for radiosurgery. The present problem of particle therapy is its limited availability. In the United States, only two proton centers can currently provide treatment for base of skull lesions. The HCL is soon to be replaced by a hospital-based facility at the MGH. Several other proton centers in the United States are currently under active consideration. Proton RT is an evolutionary process. Recent developments in proton RT include intensity modulated therapy and improvements in beam delivery systems, namely, the introduction of active beam scanning. These should further increase the degree of dose conformity. In addition, other heavy particles are also being investigated so as to combine the physical advantages of protons with the differential increased biologic effectiveness of particles in tumor as compared to normal tissues. A report from the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Darmstadt, Germany, has not revealed any increased acute toxicities in the first 13 patients with skull base chordomas or chondrosarcomas treated using carbon ions. Several important factors have emerged from recently published results: Patients with low-grade chondrosarcomas and male patients with chordomas have an excellent chance of durable tumor control and long-term survival after proton RT. Severe complications are within the acceptable range considering the high doses delivered and given the major morbidity associated with uncontrollable tumor growth in such patients. Female patients with chordomas experience increased early and late failures [References: 35]

Method: Li(Z = 3), C(Z = 6) and F(Z = 9) ion beams, with LETs of 100 keV/micron, 300 keV/micron and 1000 keV/micron, respectively were produced by HI-13 tandem accelerator at the Department of Nuclear Physics, China Institute of Atomic Energy. The human bronchial epithelium cell line (BEAS-2B) was irradiated with the designed doses ranging from 0.5 Gy to 6.0 Gy. After irradiation, the cells were cultured at 1000/flask and the survival fractions were calculated. Result: The cell survival fraction (SF, non-unit) have negative exponential relations with dose(D, Gy) as shown by the fitted equations: SF = EXP(-D/1.28)(Li); SF = EXP(-D/1.18)(C); SF = EXP(-D/2.09)(F), respectively. The sensitive parameters (D0, Gy) of radiation were D0 = 1.28; D0 = 1.18; D0 = 2.09, respectively. The patterns of cell survival were fitted to single target model. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for Li, C and F ions were 2.54, 2.67, 1.55, respectively, compared with D0 of gamma-ray irradiation. The inactivation cross sections for these ions were 12.5, 40.6 and 76.5 microns2 respectively. Conclusion: The effectiveness of radiation induced by heavy ions of Li, C and F was more serious than that of 60Co gamma-ray, and more than one particle traversal are needed to kill a cell on the average

Radiosurgery was originally devised to treat intracranial lesions by delivering a high dose of radiation precisely at the intracranial target using stereotactic guidance. The term was coined and the field defined by Lars Leksell, a visionary leader of neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Refinements in stereotactic methodologies, major improvements in dose planning software, and advances in neurodiagnostic imaging, all facilitated the increasingly broad application of brain radiosurgical methodologies. New technologies have continued to evolve and are still emerging. A variety of different radiosurgery techniques have been developed during the past 4 decades. Radiosurgery is now being used even for extracranial lesions such as spinal tumors, lung, liver, and prostate pathologies. Numerous studies have examined the benefits and risks of radiosurgery performed with various devices. The long-term results of radiosurgery are now available and have established it as an effective noninvasive management strategy for many brain disorders. Radiosurgery is now considered a mainstream neurosurgical modality for treatment of vascular malformations, tumors, trigeminal neuralgia, movement disorders, and perhaps epilepsy. Its role as a tool for spine and body surgery is also under evaluation	
3449	Minimization of target positioning error in accelerator-based radiosurgery	Boston, Head, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/st [Standards], Sensitivity and Specificity, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Women	The stereotactic radiosurgery system used at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology is patterned after that developed at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) and uses the Brown-Roberts-Wells computed tomography (CT) stereotactic system. The patient's head is attached to a stand that rotates with the treatment couch. The irradiation is conducted using a set of converging arcs of irradiation. Because of mechanical limitations, no accelerator or treatment couch is capable of placing the center of the radiation beam at precisely the same point for all gantry and couch angles and a compromise must be made when locating the nominal isocenter. The stand settings are checked by placing a radiopaque QA sphere at the desired target location. The QA sphere is imaged using a series of eight films exposed at a set of couch and gantry angles that encompass the treatment angles. The distances between the QA sphere image and the center of the radiation field indicate if the correct coordinates were set on the stand and if the radiation beam converges to a sufficiently small region (< 0.1-cm diameter) for treatment. A mathematical procedure has been developed to use the film-measured position errors to determine a stand offset that will minimize the distance between the accelerator isocenter and the target. The technique is capable of reducing the average placement error, as measured by imaging the QA sphere, to 0.035 cm with a maximum deviation of 0.07 cm

The first medical linac treated its first patient, in London, in 1953, so the use of these machines in clinical practice has been almost co-existent with the lifetime of Physics in Medicine and Biology. This review is a personal selection of things the authors feel are interesting in the history, particularly the early history, and development of clinical linacs. A brief look into the future is also given. One significant theme throughout is the continuity of ideas, building on previous experience. We hope the review might re-connect younger radiotherapy physicists in particular with some of the history and emphasize the continual need, in any human activity, to remain aware of the past, in order to make best use of past experience when taking decisions in the present.

The in-vivo MR spectra of malignant breast tissue of patients (n = 67) suffering from infiltrating ductal carcinoma are dominated by the water resonance, while the spectra of the unaffected contralateral breast tissue of these patients are mainly dominated by resonance arising from lipids which is similar to the spectra of normal breast tissue obtained from volunteers (controls, n = 16). In addition to the water and lipid peaks, in majority of the patients (approximately 80%) the water suppressed spectra showed a resonance at 3.2 ppm due to choline containing compounds (TCho) before treatment. In patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, absence/reduction in choline was observed in 89% of the patients. TCho was also observed in 2 of 14 benign lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of in-vivo MRS in detecting TCho in malignant tumours was 78% and 86%, respectively. Observation of TCho before treatment and its disappearance (or reduction) after treatment may be a useful indicator of response of locally advanced breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Early diagnosis and treatment of retinal angiomas with an appropriate systemic workup for associated systemic diseases can prevent visual loss and morbidity and mortality. Tumors less than 3 mm in diameter usually can be ablated with laser photocoagulation. Cryotherapy should be reserved for eyes in which media opacities prohibit use of the laser or the tumor is located in an area of shallow serous detachment or in the extreme peripheral retina. Macular puckers or tractional macular detachments caused by retinal angiomas can be treated effectively by pars plana vitrectomy combined with photocoagulation or cryotherapy to the retinal angioma. Penetrating diathermy is a useful alternative therapy for large tumors but is fraught with risks of hemorrhage and inadvertent retinal breaks with or without vitreous loss or retinal detachment. We have found proton-beam irradiation to be an efficacious and safe treatment for large retinal angiomas (> 3 mm) and for cases complicated by exudative retinal detachments or for tumors involving the optic nerve. We believe this new, noninvasive therapy is a significant advance in the treatment of complicated retinal angiomas or for those tumors that have failed to respond to conventional measures.

In this study, quality assurance for FSRT of 58 cases, between August 1995 and August 1997 are described, and the errors for each step and overall accuracy were estimated. Some of the important items for FSRT procedures are: accuracy in CT localization, transferred image distortion, laser alignment, isocentric accuracy of linear accelerator, head frame movement, portal verification, and various human errors. A geometric phantom, that has known coordinates was used to estimate the accuracy of CT localization. A treatment planning computer was used for checking the transferred image distortion. The mechanical isocenter standard (MIS), rectilinear phantom pointer: (RLPP), and laser target localizer frame (LTLF) were used for laser alignment and target coordinates setting. Head-frame stability check was performed by a depth confirmation helmet (DCH). A film test was done to check isocentric accuracy and portal verification. All measured data for the 58 patients were recorded and analyzed for each item. 4-MV x-rays from a linear accelerator, were used for FSRT, along with homemade circular cones with diameters from 20 to 70 mm (interval: 5 mm). The accuracy in CT localization was 1.2+/-0.5 mm. The isocentric accuracy of the linear accelerator, including laser alignment, was 0.5+/-0.2 mm. The reproducibility of the head frame was 1.1+/-0.6 mm. The overall accuracy was 1.7+/-0.7 mm, excluding human errors

The beams were monoenergetic and ranged from 100 keV to 40 MeV. The energy deposition in the body was sorted into two regions: inside and outside the irradiated volume. Most of the results obtained were for a beam size of 100 cm2 although some calculations were also made to 600 cm2 beams. The effect of beam size on energy deposition in the two regions was investigated for 60Co gamma rays. Graphs are presented which give the integral doses delivered by neutrons and photons to the two regions for therapy beams of various energies. These graphs can be used to calculate the integral doses which are delivered inside and outside the treatment volume for photon spectra from most medical accelerators. Calculations of energy deposition were also made for the spectra from two particular accelerators. These were done using Monte Carlo as well as by simply "folding" the spectra into the results for monoenergetic photons. The results obtained by both methods were in good agreement and indicated that the integral doses deposited outside the treatment volume by neutrons are more than two orders of magnitude smaller than those deposited by scattered photons

The curves for survival and mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase locus were obtained by fitting the experimental data to linear and linear-quadratic equations, respectively. In the dose interval 0-1.5 Gy, the alpha parameters of the curves were 0.42/Gy and 3.6 x 10(-6) mutants/Gy, respectively. The mutation types at the HPRT locus were analyzed by multiplex-PCR in 94 irradiated and 41 nonirradiated clones derived from T lymphocytes from five healthy donors. All clones showed a normal multiplex-PCR pattern and were classified as point mutations. Chromosome aberration data were fitted as a linear function of dose (alpha = 0.62 aberrations per cell Gy(-1)). By irradiating G0 lymphocytes from a single subject with 28 keV/microm protons and gamma rays, an RBE of 6.07 was obtained for chromosome aberrations. An overinvolvement of chromosome 9 relative to chromosome 7 was found in chromosome breaks after chromosome painting analysis

It was shown that the yield of one-hit acentric fragments increased linearly and that of double-break aberrations increased exponentially with the irradiation dose. It was demonstrated that under the influence of radiations with high linear energy transfer the number of paired fragments increased and that of dicentrics and rings decreased. The test of total yield of chromosomal aberrations and their specific types helped to derive coefficients of relative biological effectiveness of the above irradiations. There was a quantitative correlation between the dose and yield of individual aberration types. This suggests that lymphocytes can be used as a biological dosimeter for dose measurement

This paper considers this question by using radiation transport calculations to investigate a range of proton energies from 2.15 to 3.5 MeV and a range of moderator sizes. This study has moved away completely from the use of empty therapy beam parameters and instead defines the beam quality and optimizes the moderator design using widely accepted in-phantom treatment planning figures of merit. It is concluded that up to a proton energy of about 2.8 MeV there is no observed variation in the achievable therapy beam quality, but a price is paid in terms of treatment time for not choosing the upper limit of this range. For higher proton energies, the beam quality falls, but with no improvement in treatment time for optimum configurations

These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team	
2107	The effectiveness of monoenergetic neutrons at 565 keV in producing dicentric chromosomes in human lymphocytes at low doses	Adult, Chromosome Aberrations, Chromosomes,Human/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosomes,Human/ul [Ultrastructure], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Gamma Rays, Gamma Rays/ae [Adverse Effects], Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Male, Neutrons, Neutrons/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Radiobiology, Radioisotopes, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Risk, X-Rays	The induction of dicentric chromosomes in human lymphocytes from one individual irradiated in vitro with monoenergetic neutrons at 565 keV was examined to provide additional data for an improved evaluation of neutrons with respect to radiation risk in radioprotection. The resulting linear dose-response relationship obtained (0.813 +/- 0.052 dicentrics per cell per gray) over the dose range of 0.0213-0.167 Gy is consistent with published results obtained for irradiation with neutrons from different sources and with different spectra at energies lower than 1000 keV. Comparing this value to previously published "average" dose-response curves obtained by different laboratories for (60)Co gamma rays and orthovoltage X rays resulted in maximum RBEs (RBE(m)) of about 37 +/- 8 and 16 +/- 4, respectively. However, when our neutron data were matched to low-LET dose responses that were constructed several years earlier for lymphocytes from the same individual, higher values of RBE(m) resulted: 76.0 +/- 29.5 for (60)Co gamma rays and 54.2 +/- 18.4 for (137)Cs gamma rays; differentially filtered 220 kV X rays produced values of RBE(m) between 20.3 +/- 2.0 or 37.0 +/- 7. 1. The results highlight the dependence of RBE(m) on the choice of low-LET reference radiation and raise the possibility that differential individual response to low-LET radiations may need to be examined more fully in this context

Eighteen primary clones each derived from control and irradiated cultures were isolated and secondary colonies were grown up. Six of the primary clones surviving the irradiation showed significantly lower cloning efficiencies than the control clones (P < 0.001), while the rest of the surviving clones showed a cloning efficiency similar to those of the control clones. The average cloning efficiency of control and surviving clones was 16.4 and 7.2%, respectively. Reduced cloning efficiencies were also observed in the tertiary colony formation, indicating that the persistent decrease in cloning efficiency was inherited over 40 generations after X irradiation in normal human cells. Five of nine primary clones surviving the irradiation also frequently contained multiple giant cells in the colonies, while this was a rare event in the progeny of control clones. Furthermore, we analyzed in situ chromosome segregation in anaphase cells appearing during the formation of the secondary colonies. A significantly higher frequency of chromosome bridge formation was found in four of the surviving clones which received 6 Gy (P < 0.001), and the frequency of micronuclei was also increased in the surviving clones. These results provide evidence that genetic instability is induced in normal human embryonic cells by low-LET radiation, and that misrejoining of the broken chromosome ends is increased in the progeny of cells surviving X irradiation	
3864	Perspectives of tumour radiotherapy in the Czech Republic and "Oncology 2000" Foundation.

A great effort is being devoted to prevention as well as to improving early diagnosis and treatment. It is the radiotherapy which seems to bring new treatment possibilities at the present. Its goal consists in destroying all tumour cells in the target volume while all normal cells being damaged unsubstantially only. That is being achieved with standard available means only with rather great difficulties. However, in the last time two radiotherapy methods have been developed which are based on the use of the so called hadrons (i.e. particles exhibiting strong mutual interactions) and come nearer to the mentioned ideal goal of any tumour therapy. The first method consists in the application of beams of charged hadrons having a suitable characteristic of energy transfer; the most energy being transferred to the matter in the end of hadron tracks. Thus, by a suitable choice of initial energy of beam particles this maximum may lie in a tumour volume, while all other tissues obtain a smaller dose, the difference being greater when a multiple-field technique is used. The other approach (neutron capture therapy-NCT) makes use of epithermal (or thermal) neutrons captured by special isotopes accumulated in tumour cells with the help of suitable chemical carriers. Both the methods are now being introduced into clinical use in many countries. The "Oncology 2000" Foundation was grounded to introduce these methods into clinical use also in the Czech Republic. It proceeds with activities started by an interdisciplinary group of specialists formed approximately 20 years ago and having prepared some necessary conditions. As to the NCT a corresponding facility is now being finished and clinical tests are expected to be started in 1997. The main attention is now devoted to building up an oncology center based on the use of hadron beams. [References: 19]	
3798	Evaluation of a pencil-beam dose calculation technique for charged particle radiotherapy	Algorithms, California, Californium, Chordoma, Chordoma/ra [Radiography], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Skull Base, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate a pencil-beam dose calculation algorithm for protons and heavier charged particles in complex patient geometries defined by computed tomography (CT) data and to compare isodose distributions calculated with the new technique to those calculated with conventional algorithms in selected patients with skull-base tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Monte Carlo calculations were performed to evaluate the pencil-beam algorithm in patient geometries for a modulated 150-MeV proton beam. A modified version of a Monte Carlo code described in a previous publication (18) was used for these comparisons. Tissue densities were inferred from patient CT data on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and calculations were performed with and without tissue compensators. A dose calculation module using the new algorithm was written, and treatment plans using the new algorithm were compared to plans using standard ray-tracing techniques for 10 patients with clival chordoma and three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with helium lons at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL). RESULTS: Pencil beam calculations agreed well with Monte Carlo calculations in the patient geometries. The pencil-beam algorithm predicted several multiple-scattering effects that are not modeled by conventional ray-tracing calculations. These include (a) the widening of the penumbra as a function of beam penetration, (b) the degradation in the sharpness of the dose gradient at the end of the particle range in highly heterogeneous regions, and (c) the appearance of hot and cold dose regions in the shadow of complex heterogeneities. In particular, pencil-beam calculations indicated that the dose distribution within the target was not as homogeneous as expected on the basis of ray-tracing calculations. On average, for the 13 patients considered, only about 72% of the conedown target volume received at least 99% of the prescribed dose, whereas, 93% of the conedown volume was contained within the 95% isodose surface. This may be significant because in standard charged particle dose calculations, the dose across the spread-Bragg peak is assumed to be uniform and equal to the maximum or prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Dose distributions computed with the pencil-beam model are more accurate than ray-tracing calculations, providing additional information to clinicians, which may influence the doses they prescribe. In particular, these calculations indicate that for some patients with skull-base tumors, it may be advantageous to prescribe proton doses to a lower isodose level than is commonly done	
1141	Evaluation of therapeutic potential of heavy ion therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Feasibility Studies, Femur Head, Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Male, Motion, Movement, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of raster scanned heavy charged particle therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa,) with special regard to the influence of internal organ motion on the dose distribution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients	
3342	On the use of the pion stopping distribution and the lesion additivity concept for the calculation of effective doses in pion treatment planning.[see comment]	British Columbia, Canada, Elementary Particles, Humans, Mesons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Universities	The large spatial variation in LET, and hence in RBE, is one of the main obstacles in the development of routine treatment planning of charged particle beams. Since the biological effect distribution of plans cannot be realistically measured for each patient, a simple scheme of relating effect to basic empirical physical measurement is required. For the case of a pion beam, the high LET dose distribution is correlated with that of the pion stopping density, which can be indirectly measured using several techniques. A scheme based on this spatial correlation has been developed. In this method, after partitioning the local dose into a high and a low LET fraction, the local effective dose is computed using a simple formula extracted from a recent analysis of radiobiological results for mixtures of radiations of different LET. This simple formula can also be derived from a mechanistic model of mixed radiation action developed using the hypothesis of additivity of common intermediate lesions. In this paper, the concept of spatial correlation between the high LET dose and the pion stars is merged with the concept of lesion additivity for mixed radiation, from which a simple computational scheme is formulated for the calculation of effective doses in the treatment planning of pions. Similar schemes can also be developed for other charged particle beams

[Review] [21 refs]	Austria, Carbon, Europe, Forecasting, France, Germany, Humans, Ions, Italy, Japan, Light, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy, Sweden, Switzerland, X-Rays	Hadrontherapy is the radiotherapy technique that uses protons, neutrons or carbon ions. Protons and ions, being, heavy' charged particles, allow a more, conformal' treatment than X-rays and thus spare better the surrounding healthy tissues. By now about 35,000 patients have been treated worldwide with protons and about 1,600 with carbon ions. Since few years protontherapy of deep-seated tumours is booming with two hospital centres running in USA and three under construction. Four centres are treating patients in Japan. The list of constructions going on elsewhere is long: two in China, one in Germany, one in Korea, one in Switzerland. But the future hopes for a qualitatively different radiotherapy are centred on carbon ions: they have a larger biological effectiveness than X-rays and protons and are particularly suited to treat radio resistant tumours, as indicated by the encouraging results obtained on about 1,400 patients in HIMAC (Chiba, Japan) and on about 200 patients at GSI (Darmstadt). Two carbon centres are under construction in Europe: one (designed by GSI) in Heidelberg (Germany) and the other (designed by the TERA Foundation, in collaboration with CERN and INFN) in Pave (Italy). Other projects are moving towards the financing phase in Wiener Neustadt (Austria), Lyon (France) and Stockholm (Sweden). The five European projects are collaborating in the framework of ENLIGHT, the European Network for Light ion Therapy. [References: 21]	
49	Beam characteristics of a retrofitted double-focused multileaf collimator	Biophysics, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation, Technology,Radiologic	Multileaf collimators (MLCs) are generally believed to be convenient and cost-effective tools for intensity modulation and conformal therapy. They are becoming a standard feature on new accelerators; however, the older units can be retrofitted with modern MLCs. Before such a unit can be clinically used, the beam characteristics must be verified. In this study the beam characteristics of a Siemens double-focused MLC retrofitted to an MD2 linear accelerator are presented. The head leakage along with inter- and intra-leaf radiation transmission were measured using film. The collimator (Sc), phantom (Sp), total (Scp) scatter factors, central axis depth dose, beam profiles for off-axis ratios, penumbra, and surface dose were evaluated for square, rectangular, and irregularly shaped fields. The maximum head leakage was estimated to be < 0.05% in any plane at a distance of 1 m and maximum transmission through the MLC leaves was estimated to be < 1.4% and < 1.1% for the 10 MV and 6 MV beams, respectively. The maximum differences between pre- and post-MLC installation data for the Sc and Scp were < or = 0.7% and < or = 1.4%, respectively. Similarly, the percent depth dose data for all fields and both beam energies were within 1.5% of the original data. The beam profiles measured at various depths were also in agreement with those of the pre-MLC installation data. The measured beam penumbra (20%-80%) showed a range of 7.8 mm-11.0 mm for the 6 MV and 8.4 mm-11.1 mm for the 10 MV beams from smallest to largest fields. These ranges differ by less than a millimeter from those of the old data. The surface dose measurements were slightly lower than the conventional jaw values suggesting that MLC does not produce significant electron contamination. It is concluded that the retrofitted MLC maintains the integrity of the original beam and may provide a cost-effective conformal therapy

Results are presented for two possible window designs, cells plated on the vacuum-isolation window and cells plated on Mylar above the vacuum-isolation window. Even for the thicker dual-membrane window that facilitates tissue culture and allows the target cell to be centered relative to the electron beam, the majority of the calculated beam spreading was contained in a volume typical of the mammalian HeLa cell line. None of the 10(4) electrons simulated at 25 keV were scattered into the spatial region occupied by neighbors of the target cell. Dose leakage was largest at 50 keV where the mean energy deposited in all neighbors was 21% of that deposited in the target cell. This ratio was reduced to 5% at 90 keV, the highest beam energy simulated. Lineal energy spectra of energy deposition events scored in the nucleus of the target cell became progressively more like the gamma-ray spectrum as the electron beam energy increased. Hence, our simulations provide strong support for the feasibility of a low-LET, single-cell irradiator

3845	A novel fast neutron dosemeter based on fission chambers. Part I: Principles of operation and theoretical response in neutron therapy radiation fields	Heat, Humans, Mathematics, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Uncertainty	A novel method is proposed of accurately measuring fast neutron doses of interest in radiotherapy. The technique, which utilizes calculated neutron fluence-to-kerma conversion factors, is based upon the combination of measurements with calibrated neptunium-237 and uranium-238 pulse fission chambers to obtain a response which matches the variation of kerma with neutron energy. The theoretical performance of a practical instrument has been assessed for a variety of neutron spectra to evaluate the spectrum dependence of the dosemeter. The overall systematic uncertainty using this absolute method of determining the neutron dose under charged particle equilibrium conditions is comparable to that encountered with ionization chamber techniques

Hopefully, it will also be useful for heavy charged particle therapy in the future

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation

The constant support of an up-to-date and specialized laboratory and nursing staff may reduce the most common compliances of the neoplastic disease course and therapy. Neoplastic child with his family is facing a terrible stress, often with incumbent death risks. So a psychologic help is advisable for the whole family, and the best feeling is requested for the physicians. Supportive therapy must provide prevention and correction of the most common compliances of tumoral conditions, i.e. infections and hemorrhages . A correct and specific antibiotic therapy is absolutely necessary, but sometime is not sufficient.

Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66%) of these were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the data were statistically processed by using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 5 years or until death with a median follow-up time of 59.2 months (range, 6.0-83.0 months). The local control rate for all patients was 94.7%. The patients' 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 75.7% (IA: 89.4; IB: 55.1), and overall survival 50.0% (IA: 55.2; IB: 42.9). No toxic reactions in the lung greater than Grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy, a new treatment modality with superior benefits in terms of quality of life and activity of daily living, has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for Stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma

Conventional and IMRT treatment plans were generated to deliver 45 Gy to the prostate, seminal vessicles and external and internal iliac lymph nodes. Neutron spectra were determined by unfolding measurements from a TLD-based Bonner sphere system. Treatments using 18 MV IMRT and conventional plans result in neutron ambient dose-equivalents of 687 and 112 mSv, respectively. Delivery of the 15 MV IMRT and conventional plans results in neutron ambient dose-equivalents of 327 and 52 mSv, respectively. The data illustrate that using lower photon energies for IMRT reduces the secondary neutron dose, while still achieving comparable treatment volume coverage and sparing critical normal tissue

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

[Japanese]	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adult, Aged, Autopsy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Head, Humans, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Survival, Time, Tungsten, Universities	A stereotactic irradiation (STI) system using a linear accelerator was developed and its effectiveness for brain metastasis was investigated. The system consisted of a conventional linear accelerator, invasive fixation head frame (RADFRAME, Mizuho Ika Kogyo), and a tungsten collimator. The RADFRAME was developed to be used with any linear accelerators and with any dose planning systems. The accuracy of the irradiation was assured to be within +/-1.5mm. Fifty-one patients with metastatic brain tumors were treated using the system. The overall median survival time was 10 months. No difference in survival was observed between patients with a single lesion and patients with two or three lesions. Complete, partial, and minimal responses were obtained in 16 (39%), 18 (41%), and 7 (16%) lesions. These were comparable to the reported results of gamma knife treatment. A maximum dose of 25 Gy was suggested to be more effective than lower doses. Local control rate was higher in tumors with a diameter of less than 2.0cm (87.5%) than in larger tumors (60%). No difference in tumor response was observed among various histopathologic types. In a patient with a 25mm cerebellar metastasis from an adenocarcinoma of the lung, autopsy at 5 months after STI showed fibrinoid degeneration and hyaline deposition without residual tumor at the Gd-enhanced region on MRI. The efficacy of linac stereotactic irradiation was equal to that of gamma knife radiotherapy for metastatic brain tumors	
3768	Treatment planning for particle radiation therapy	Brain, Cyclotrons, Elementary Particles, Eye, Fast Neutrons, Helium, Humans, Ions, Methods, Neutrons, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Spinal Cord	Fast neutrons beams from the new medically dedicated cyclotrons in the US have depth dose characteristics comparable to photon beams from a 6-MV linear accelerator, at best. Treatment planning will have specific difficulties related to the relatively increased radiosensitivities of the brain, spinal cord, lens of the eye, and salivary gland. Therefore, exploitation of the potential biologic advantages compared to high energy photons will extract the price of increased difficulties in treatment planning. Dosimetric advantages of protons and helium ions compared to high energy photons are real and make possible the high-dose irradiation of cancers immediately adjacent to sensitive critical normal structures. Treatment planning and delivery with a precision of less than 2 mm is necessary. Such methods are already operational. Particle radiation therapy facilities are national resources, which can help the clinical radiation oncologist in the unique management of a few, specific problems

Depending on the size and shape of the target volume optimum values for the isocenter distance, collimator apertures and dose inhomogeneity have been determined which serve as starting parameters for the interactive optimization of dose distribution. The treatment planning system of the stereotactic unit SRS-200 (Philips) has been used to calculate the parameter tables. However, the presented results are also applicable to other stereotactic systems

This technique is referred to in this paper as aperture modulation arc therapy (AMAT). During this arc, the MLC leaves do not conform to the projection of the target PTV and the machine output of the accelerator has a constant value. Dose was calculated using the CORVUS 4.0 IMRT system, which uses a pencil beam dose algorithm, and treatments were delivered using a Varian 2100C/D Clinac. Results are presented for a head and neck and a prostate case, showing the equivalence of the IMRT and the translated AMAT delivery. For a prostate AMAT delivery, coronal plane film dose for the IMRT and AMAT deliveries agreed within 7.19 +/- 6.62%. For a meningioma the coronal plane dose distributions were similar to a value of 4.6 +/- 6.62%. Dose to the isocentre was measured as being within 2% of the planned value in both cases

2066	The 'equivalent wedge' implementation of the Varian Enhanced Dynamic Wedge (EDW) into a treatment planning system	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, France, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research	The purpose of this work was to establish procedures for the implementation of the Varian Enhanced Dynamic Wedge into a treatment planning system (TPS), based as much as possible on simple theoretical considerations and already available data. A method is presented for the calculation (rather than measurement) of off-axis relative wedge transmission curves that are required by the TPS for relative dose calculations. We also present a method for absolute dose (monitor unit) calculations, based on the calculation of an effective wedge factor on the prescription point. A simple formula has been derived for the calculation of the effective wedge factor for the most general case, i.e. an arbitrary effective wedge angle, field size and prescription point. Relative dose calculations have been verified by measurements performed on a Varian Clinac 2300C/D linear accelerator, for 6 MV and 20 MV photon energies. Monitor unit calculations have also been verified experimentally for several cases such as symmetric and asymmetric fields with prescription on the collimator axis or on the geometrical centre of the asymmetric field. The presented technique provides results within 2% for both relative and absolute dose calculations for clinically relevant cases	
3688	Stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations in childhood	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebral Angiography, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Italy, Male, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies, Universities	BACKGROUND: The main techniques and results in stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of endocranial AVM's are described and compared. The authors also report their preliminary experience in the treatment of 6 consecutive pediatric patients with intracerebral vascular malformations using gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery. METHODS: The various stereotactic radiosurgery methods currently used (charged-particle beam, modified linear accelerator, and GK) are described. At the Department of Neurosurgery in Verona, from February 1993 to February 1996, stereotactic GK radiosurgery was performed on 721 patients, including 20 of pediatric age (3%). Of the 78 AVMs, 7 (9%) were diagnosed in children. One patient was lost at follow-up. Among the remaining 6 children, there were 3 males and 3 females with a mean age of 12.3 years (range, 5-16 years). Treatment general anesthesia was needed only in 1 case. The AVM volume was always less than 10 cc. After completion of the procedure, children were discharged from the hospital the following day. RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 29 months (median 18.8 months). The angiographic confirmed total obliteration is used as the end point of an AVM treated radiosurgically, and usually requires 2 to 3 years. All the patients are alive; four of the treated children are neurologically normal and one patient has clinically improved to a normal neurological status. The sixth patient has fixed neurological deficits that existed prior to treatment. Among the three cases with a follow-up period of over 2 years, complete obliteration has been angiographically confirmed in 2 patients and subtotal in 1 patient. In the three remaining patients with follow-up periods less than 2 years, serial MR images suggest subtotal obliteration in 2 cases and no significant change in one patient who had undergone treatment within the current year. To date, neither persistent GK radiosurgery-related complications nor bleeding following stereotactic radiosurgery has been described. CONCLUSIONS: The review of literature and our preliminary results suggest that also in children, as in adults, the use of stereotactically delivered irradiation represents a safe and effective technique obtaining complete obliteration of AVMs previously considered surgically inaccessible due to their location and poor response to resection and/or embolization

For all radiation qualities a dose-dependent increase in mutant frequency was found for doses giving surviving fractions greater than about 0.20. The effectiveness per unit dose for both inactivation and mutation induction increased with the linear energy transfer of the radiation to a maximum in the range 90-200 keV micrometer-1. However, the maximum mutagenic effectiveness relative to gamma-rays was about two or more times that for inactivation. It is suggested that a proportion of the radiation-induced mutants suffer extensive genetic damage, and that some forms of this damage may be induced with high efficiency by radiations of high linear energy transfer

A breast phantom was fabricated from machineable wax and placed on the chest wall of an anthropomorphic phantom. Radiographic film was used to measure the dose distribution at the axial midplane of the breast phantom. Subsequently, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used to measure the dose at four points within the midplane to validate the accuracy of the film dosimetry. Film measurements were compared with calculations performed using the treatment planning system for four types of treatment: optimized wedged beams at 6 and 18 MV and two-dimensional compensated beams at 6 and 18 MV. Both the film- and TLD-measured doses had a precision of approximately 0.6%. The film-measured doses were approximately 1.5% lower than the TLD-measured doses, ranging from 0-3% at 6 MV and 0.5-1% at 18 MV. Such results placed a high level of confidence in the accuracy and precision of the film data. The measured and calculated doses agreed to within +/-3% for both the film and TLD measurements throughout the midplane exclusive of areas not having charged particle equilibrium. Good agreement was not expected within these regions due to the limitations in both film dosimetry and the dose-calculation algorithm. These results indicated that the treatment planning system calculates doses at the midplane with clinically acceptable accuracy in conditions simulating tangential breast treatment

3650	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: local recurrence after proton beam therapy	Adult, Boston, Cobalt, Eye, Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty-three of 1006 (2.3%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986 received additional treatment for documented (15 patients) or suspected (eight patients) tumor growth in the irradiated eye. Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related	
125	Review of current protocols for protontherapy in USA. [Review] [45 refs]	Clinical Protocols, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], United States	The basis for interest in proton beams by clinical radiation oncologists lies in reduction in treatment volume. The yields from employing a smaller treatment volume are the increase of tumor control probability and the reduction of normal tissues complication probability. The clinical use of proton therapy began in 1954 at Uppsala University in Sweden and in 1961 at Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory in Boston, USA. So far, the total number of worldwide patients treated by protons is about 20,000. In this paper attention will be given to the treatment of patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital-Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary-Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, and at the Loma Linda University Medical Center. In particular, a review of the literature about the techniques and the results of treatment of skull base and cervical spine chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma, skull base meningioma, pituitary tumors, paranasal sinus carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, artero-venous malformations, uveal melanoma, macular degeneration, retinoblastoma, thoracic spine-sacrum tumors, and prostate carcinoma is presented. In order to verify and improve the clinical results, the conduct of prospective trials on an inter-institutional basis is essential. To facilitate the conduct of such studies the US National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology have established the Proton Therapy Oncology Group (PROG). Several phase III and some phase I-II trials are active at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, and at the Loma Linda University Medical Center. [References: 45]

The method ensured the coincidence of the results with average experimental data with the accuracy no less than 3%, and could be used for dosimetric design of cancer therapy with fast neutrons	
4596	A 244Cm irradiator for protracted exposure of cultured Mammalian cells with alpha particles	Alpha Particles, Cells,Cultured, Curium, Fibroblasts, Helium, Humans, Italy, Pressure, Radiation Dosage, Research, Stainless Steel, Steel, Temperature	A 244Cm alpha-particle irradiator was designed and constructed for radiobiological studies where protracted exposure at a low dose rate of cultured mammalian cells is required. It allows irradiation of a cell monolayer attached to the Mylar bottom of a specially designed Petri dish of 56 mm diameter (approximately 25 cm(2) area). The irradiator is based on a 20-mm-diameter stainless steel chamber containing a 148 kBq 244Cm source. The chamber, flushed with helium gas at a pressure kept slightly above the external pressure, is inserted into a cell incubator where temperature and CO2 concentration are controlled. Spectrometric and dosimetric characterization of the irradiator was carried out by means of an ion-implanted-silicon charged-particle detector, CR39 detectors, and Monte Carlo simulations with the TRIM code. Average LET of particles incident on the cells at the center of the Petri dish was evaluated to be 120 keV microm(-1) at 59 mm from the source, and the average dose rate was 5.69 x 10 Gy s(-1), with +12% and -8% variations at the center and the edge, respectively. The irradiator has been successfully tested and used for several experiments involving 16-d exposure of human fibroblasts monolayers

Between 1983 and 1988, 127 patients were treated. Results are analysed on a group of 84 patients followed 18 months and more. In 72 cases a reduction of thickness was noted. It was complete in 33 cases. Enucleation was performed in 10 patients due to no response or regrowth. In 3 cases the tumor was sterilized. Five patients died of metastases, and 73 are alive, 3 of them with liver metastases. An afterloading iridium template disk was used in 8 patients. 4 of them with a tumor thickness between 6.5 and 8 mm had a good response. Edema of the fovea was observed in 21% of cases, while cataracts were very unusual with Ru 106. An enucleation was performed in 6 patients because of a complication. A useful vision may be preserved in 60% of cases. The scleral tolerance dose is close to 1,500 Gy. These results are in agreement with those of the literature and are considered to be satisfactory for tumors not exceeding 5 to 6 mm in thickness. If the tumor is located close to the fovea or the papilla, and/or if the thickness is 8 mm or more, proton beam could be a good alternative	
4495	Measurement of photon beam backscatter from collimators to the beam monitor chamber using target-current-pulse-counting and telescope techniques	Canada, Head, Humans, Jaw, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Scattering,Radiation	Backscattered radiation (BSR) arising from field-defining collimators and entering the beam monitor chamber (BMC) may contribute to observed variations in medical linear accelerator photon beam output with collimator setting. Measuring the magnitude of such contributions for particular accelerators under specified operating conditions is therefore important when attempting to understand and model accelerator head scatter. The present work was conducted to confirm some backscatter measurements for collimating jaws reported previously and to extend these to include other accelerators and a multileaf collimator (MLC). BSR reaching the BMC from the jaws of Clinac 600C, 2100C and 2300CD accelerators and from an MLC on the 2300CD was investigated using both target-current-pulse-counting and telescope methods. Our measurements show that for the Clinac 600C BSR-dependent output variations are negligible. However, for the 2100C and 2300CD BSR-dependent relative output increased in an almost linear fashion, by up to 2.4% for 15 and 18 MV beams, and by up to 1.7% for 6 MV beams, as the field size varied from 5 x 5 cm2 to 40 x 40 cm2. The magnitude of BSR dependent upon collimator location in the head, as expected, thereby contributing to the collimator exchange effect. An earlier study at our centre using the telescope method had reported higher BSR levels. This discrepancy was resolved when corrections for telescope block and room scatter, previously assumed negligible, were made	
3830	Radiosurgery with photon beams: physical aspects and adequacy of linear accelerators	Canada, Costs and Cost Analysis, Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Rotation, Skin, Time, Universities	The question of the adequacy of isocentric linear accelerators (linacs) for use in radiosurgery is addressed. The general physical requirements for radiosurgery, mainly a high spatial and numerical accuracy of dose delivery, reasonable treatment time, and low skin and leakage dose as well as cost considerations are examined. Various linac-based procedures are analyzed in view of their ability to meet these requirements and are contrasted with the clinically proven system of the Gamma unit. It is shown that the linac-based multiple converging arcs techniques and the dynamic rotation meet the stringent physical requirements on dose delivery and are thus viable alternatives to radiosurgery with the commercially available and dedicated Gamma unit

The verification is usually conducted with measurements and independent dose calculations. However, currently available independent dose calculation methods were developed for step-and-shoot beam delivery methods, and their uses for dynamic multi-leaf collimator (MLC) delivery methods are not efficient. In this study, a dose calculation method was developed to perform independent dose verifications for a dynamic MLC-based IMRT technique for Varian linear accelerators. This method extracts the machine delivery parameters from the dynamic MLC (DMLC) files generated by the IMRT treatment planning system. Based on the parameters a monitor unit (MU) matrix was separately calculated as two terms: direct exposure from the open MLC field and leakage contributions, where the leaf-end leakage contribution becomes more important in higher dose gradient regions. The MU matrix was used to compute the primary dose and the scattered dose with a modified Clarkson technique. The doses computed using the method were compared with both measurement and treatment planning for 14 and 25 plans respectively. An average of less than 2% agreement was observed and the standard deviation was about 1.9%

RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to woodworking, several risk factors for nasal and paranasal sinus cancers have been identified, most notably smoking. Progress in the differential diagnosis of small round cell nasal and paranasal sinus cancers allows the precise diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma. Despite recent improvements, T staging for ethmoid and nasal cavity needs refinement. An association of surgery and radiation therapy remains the best treatment modality. Major developments include endoscopic resection of nasal and paranasal sinus cancers, high-precision radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and proton-beam radiotherapy. There is probably no role for chemotherapy in esthesioneuroblastoma. Although chemotherapy is important for aggressive neoplasms, its generalized use for nasal and paranasal sinus cancers awaits the application/development of newer drugs. These drugs might be applied locally since the majority of recurrences remain local. SUMMARY: Progress in the treatment of nasal and paranasal sinus cancers could be achieved through better prevention and the developments of more selective treatments such as endoscopic resection, high-precision radiotherapy, and new chemotherapy drugs.

Acute toxicity for skin, mucous membrane, salivary and subcutaneous tissues was graded using the EORTC/RTOG scoring system. Analysis indicates 17.4 Gy n gamma as "safe". A further twelve patients are to be assigned to the higher dose (18.6 Gy n gamma) before making a final dose selection

A Komai stereotactic ring was used to locate the target coordinates. The patient was laid on the Linac treatment table and held in the head fixation system. Irradiation was given in five positions. The dose profile by film dosimetry and Rando phantom was satisfactory. Seventeen tumors in 14 patients were treated. Clinical or histological diagnoses were nine metastases, one benign and two malignant gliomas, one meningioma, and one craniopharyngioma. Tumor sizes were between 8 and 30 mm. Doses were between 12 and 30 Gy. Computed tomographic evaluation after 3 months of 12 tumors in 11 survivors showed one complete remission, three partial remission, six no change, and two partial deterioration. For progressive tumors, Linac radiosurgery results are excellent

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a method that allows highly conformal delivery of radiotherapy. In recent years, its use has spread rapidly in both academic and community radiation oncology facilities. The use of IMRT has raised multiple issues related to target definition, optimal treatment delivery methods, and the need to account for anatomic changes occurring during therapy. Some of these issues are reviewed in this article. [References: 73]	
2617	Fractionation and therapeutic ratio with neutron therapy	Animals, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Fast Neutrons, France, Humans, Lead, Linear Energy Transfer, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Time, Time Factors	Dose-response relationships of most tumours and normal tissues after neutron irradiation are characterized by relatively high alpha/beta ratios. Late reacting tissues are not as protected by low doses per fraction as they are after low linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation. Using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model with the time factor (when needed), we have calculated the therapeutic ratio (TR) as the ratio of the effect on a tumour (or an acutely responding tissue) over that on late reacting tissue. Hypothetical cases are given as well as a case derived from LQ parameters obtained experimentally in animals. It is shown that X-ray fractionation schemes that lead to a high TR will lead to a low neutron TR. For epithelial tumours, a neutron gain factor, GF (ratio of TR) is possible if neutron fractionation is compared to hypofractionated X-irradiation. Neutron treatment over conventional overall times of rapidly proliferating tumours carries a low TR and offers no GF. Neutron therapy for tumours with low alpha/beta ratios offer a potential advantage compared to tumours with high alpha/beta ratios	
4015	Component evaluation of event size spectra for a clinical 14-MeV neutron beam	Germany, Humans, Mice, Models,Theoretical, Neutrons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness	Microdosimetric investigations were performed in a solid TE phantom at the DT-neutron generator at Hamburg-Eppendorf. Event size spectra were measured at different depths on the axis of a 10 X 10 cm2 field and at different lateral positions at a constant depth. Additionally, the microdosimetric spectrum of a 60Co source was determined. From radiobiological measurements the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of crypt stem cells of mice was estimated as a function of lineal energy. The measured microdosimetric spectra are folded with this RBE function so that RBE values at different positions in the phantom were obtained. The predicted change of the RBE inside and outside the useful beam of a 10 X 10 cm2 field is shown. Contributions to the RBE dose from the various charged particle components are analyzed separately	
445	Evaluation of surface and superficial dose for head and neck treatments using conventional or intensity-modulated techniques	Antineoplastic Protocols, Calibration, Fluorides/ch [Chemistry], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lithium Compounds/ch [Chemistry], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/mt [Methods]	With increased use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck treatment questions have arisen as to selection of an optimum treatment approach when either superficial sparing or treatment is desired. Other work has pointed out the increased superficial dose resulting from obliquity effects when multiple tangential beams are applied to head and neck treatment, as is the general case in IMRT planning. Helical tomotherapy might be expected to result in even further enhanced superficial dose compared with conventional bilateral field treatment. We have designed a typical right oropharynx target volume in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Three different treatment techniques have been used to optimally treat this target, including bilateral static fields, eight-field IMRT and helical tomotherapy. The phantom was immobilized in a standard treatment position and treated on a Varian 2300cd linear accelerator and on a Hi-Art Helical Tomotherapy unit. 1 mm3 lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed on the surface of the phantom at a number of axial test positions. Film strips (Kodak EDR2) were either wrapped around the surface or sandwiched within the phantom. Measured doses at the surface and as a function of depth are compared with the planning system predictions for each treatment technique. The maximum surface doses on the proximal treatment side, averaged from TLDs and films, were measured to be 69-82% of the target dose with the bilateral fields yielding the lowest surface doses (69%), tomotherapy about 2% more than that (71%) and IMRT 13% more (82%). Anterior to the target volume, doses are always low for bilateral treatment. In this case the minimum anterior surface dose (chin area) was 6% of the prescription dose from that technique as compared with 26% and 35% from the IMRT and tomotherapy methods, respectively. The Eclipse and Tomotherapy planning systems both modelled deep and superficial doses well. Surface doses were better modelled by Eclipse at the test points, while the tomotherapy plans consistently overestimated the measured doses by 10% or more. Depth dose measurements, extracted from embedded films, indicated the depth of dose build-up to >99% to be the shallowest for IMRT (2-5 mm) followed by tomotherapy (5-8 mm) and bilateral fields (10-15 mm). The amount of surface dose is clearly technique dependent and should be taken into account in the planning stage

Low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance and electron nuclear double resonance studies	Animals, Bicarbonates/ch [Chemistry], Binding Sites, Biophysics, Cattle, Copper/ch [Chemistry], Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy, Free Radicals, Helium, Histidine/ch [Chemistry], Humans, Hydrogen Peroxide/ch [Chemistry], Hydrogen Peroxide/pd [Pharmacology], Magnetics, Models,Chemical, Models,Molecular, Models,Statistical, Mutation, Nitrogen, Oxygen/me [Metabolism], Phenylalanine/ch [Chemistry], Protons, Research, Spectrophotometry, Superoxide Dismutase/ch [Chemistry], Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism], Temperature, Time, Time Factors, Tryptophan/ch [Chemistry], Tyrosine, Ultraviolet Rays	Using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy at liquid helium temperatures, the Cu(II) coordination geometry at the active site of bovine and human copper,zinc-superoxide dismutases (bSOD1 and hSOD1) treated with H(2)O(2) and bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) was examined. The time course EPR of wild type human SOD1 (WT hSOD1), W32F hSOD1 mutant (tryptophan 32 substituted with phenylalanine), and bSOD1 treated with H(2)O(2) and HCO(3)(-) shows an initial reduction of active site Cu(II) to Cu(I) followed by its oxidation back to Cu(II) in the presence of H(2)O(2). However, HCO(3)(-) induced a Trp-32-derived radical from WT hSOD1 but not from bSOD1. The mutation of Trp-32 by phenylalanine totally eliminated the Trp-32 radical signal generated from W32F hSOD1 treated with HCO(3)(-) and H(2)O(2). Further characterization of the free radical was performed by UV irradiation of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1 that generated tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals. Both proton ((1)H) and nitrogen ((14)N) ENDOR studies of bSOD1 and hSOD1 in the presence of H(2)O(2) revealed a change in the geometry of His-46 (or His-44) and His-48 (or His-46) coordinated to Cu(II) at the active site of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1, respectively. However, in the presence of HCO(3)(-) and H(2)O(2), both (1)H and (14)N ENDOR spectra were almost identical to those derived from native bSOD1. We conclude that HCO(3)(-)-derived oxidant does not alter significantly the Cu(II) active site geometry and histidine coordination to Cu(II) in SOD1 as does H(2)O(2) alone; however, the oxidant derived from HCO(3)(-) (i.e. carbonate anion radical) reacts with surface-associated Trp-32 in hSOD1 to form the corresponding radical

LNCaP cell clones stably expressing IkappaBalpha super repressor were resistant to apoptosis induced by death ligands in the presence or absence of irradiation. IkappaBalpha super repressor expression also increased clonogenic survival after exposure to TNF-alpha+irradiation, but had no effect on survival after irradiation alone. IkappaBalpha super repressor expression blocked the increase of whole cell and cell surface FAS expression induced by TNF-alpha, but did not effect induction of FAS expression and cell surface FAS expression that resulted from irradiation. In cells expressing IkappaBalpha super repressor there was diminished activation of caspases-8 and -7 and diminished production of proscaspases-8 and -7, usually required for death induction in LNCaP cells. Peptide inhibitors of caspase activation complemented the IkappaBalpha super repressor inhibition of apoptosis, but peptide inhibitors of serine proteases had no effect on LNCaP cells expressing IkappaBalpha super repressor. Moreover, cleavage of a serine protease substrate was induced by treatment of LNCaP cells with TNF-alpha and irradiation. The data suggest that in LNCaP cells NF-kappaB mediates a proapoptotic pathway that leads to activation of proapoptotic serine proteases

The advent of localized proton spectroscopy has made this detection possible. The spectral peak intensities were found to be very different depending on tumor tissue pathology. METHODS: The tumor cell reaction after radiation therapy was examined with proton localized spectroscopy in addition to enhanced MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips, Gyroscan S15-HP). Plain MR images (short spin echo) were used for localization pilot images, and after the MRS study, contrast enhanced MRI was carried out. Studies were performed pre-radiation, mid-radiation, and post-radiation if possible. MATERIALS: Sixteen patients (total 27 examinations) with intracranial tumors and three normal volunteers underwent proton NMR localized spectroscopy. The brain tumors were diagnosed before the MR study, and nine patients had metastatic brain tumors, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, and seven other patients were diagnosed with glioma-type tumors. RESULTS: The reaction patterns of proton NMR spectroscopy of brain tumors after radiation therapy were very different and depended on tumor histology. CONCLUSION: Proton NMR spectroscopy is an excellent means of determining tumor cell viability

To this end, we have used a digital, on-line, megavoltage imaging system for the verification of breast treatments, in particular. Quick, high-quality images are produced from which the depth of lung irradiated during treatment is very easily determined using the system software. We describe how this quantitative clinical information has been used to assess critical aspects of the treatment technique, and also patient orientated criteria, throughout the course of treatment	
3466	Design and characteristics of a facility for total-body and large-field irradiation	Air, Boston, Facility Design and Construction, Filtration, Humans, Light, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Whole-Body Irradiation	A facility for total-body X ray irradiation has been built using two 4 MV linear accelerators, one supported from the ceiling and one placed in a floor pit. The maximum distance between the sources is 410 cm. The patient lies supine on a light, movable support with a stretched-canvas top, halfway between the sources where the field size is 80 X 220 cm2. A special flattening filter maintains the doserate variation in air within +/- 3% over the central 70 X 200 cm2 of the field, but some quality variations within the beam are noticeable. The doserate at 205 cm distance from the sources is variable between 0.05 and 0.8 Gy/min (half from each source). To permit treatment of large fields at higher doserates, the accelerators can be moved vertically to place the sources at 120 cm or 160 cm from the patient's midplane. For this purpose, independently movable collimators are provided and the flattening filter is designed to provide two options, one for the large total-body field and the other with less filtration covering a smaller solid angle. At 120 cm distance, each beam can provide a doserate of up to 1.1 Gy/min	
161	Particle beam radiation therapy in prostate cancer: is there an advantage?. [Review] [35 refs]	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Photons, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	Hadron therapy uses heavy particles to deliver therapeutic ionizing energy. Each particle's inherent attributes determine the pattern of energy deposited by its beam, expressed in macro (conformability to a three-dimensional target volume) and micro (radiobiologic properties) distributions. Mass and charge regulate the inherent properties; beam energy provides a controllable, variable characteristic. Generally, heavy charged particles provide superior macrodosimetric properties; heavy particles (charged or not) have microdosimetric characteristics that produce high linear energy transfer (LET). Neutron macrodosimetry is similar to that of photons. Protons and helium ions possess superior macrodosimetric properties, plus microdosimetric characteristics resulting in low LET, yielding beam characteristics that approach the ideal for clinical radiotherapy. Hadron therapy for prostate cancer has been limited by the availability of appropriate treatment facilities. Nonetheless, encouraging results have been obtained. Neutron therapy demonstrated improved overall survival in a multi-institutional randomized trial, and improved local disease control in a subsequent trial. Proton radiation forms the boost component of several conformal dose-escalation studies. A Loma Linda University study demonstrated low treatment-related morbidity despite a prostate dose of 75 CGE; late-morbidity data were superior to published reports from multi-field, conformal photon therapy. A Phase III dose-escalation study of protons for early prostate cancer is proceeding. Copyright 1998 W.B. Saunders Company. [References: 35]	
704	Dynamic collimator optimization compared with fixed collimator angle in arc-based stereotactic radiotherapy: a dosimetric analysis	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods]	OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of static and dynamic collimator optimization when using a micromultileaf collimator (mMLC) in dynamic-arc stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) by evaluating the dose to healthy peritumoral tissue. METHODS: Thirty patients previously treated for intracranial lesions with the BrainLAB mMLC underwent retrospective replanning. Three collimator optimization strategies were compared for a simulated SRS treatment plan, as follows: Strategy 1, static collimation fixed at 90 degrees throughout arcs; Strategy 2, static collimator settings optimized for each arc; and Strategy 3, dynamic collimator settings optimized every 10 degrees throughout treatment arcs. Dose-volume histograms for a 0.7-cm shell of healthy peritumoral tissue were quantitatively compared. Collimator optimization schemes (Strategies 2 and 3) significantly decreased the volume of peritumoral tissue that is irradiated when compared with static collimation at 90 degrees (Strategy 1). The volume was reduced by 40.6% for Strategy 2 (95% confidence interval [CI] +/- 11) and by 47.1% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 8.1) at the 95% isodose; by 28.4% for Strategy 2 (95% CI +/- 4.9) and 39.1% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 6) at the 90% isodose; and by 18.2% for Strategy 2 (95% CI +/- 8.1) and 25.4% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 7.1) at the 80% isodose. Serial collimator optimization throughout the treatment arcs (Strategy 3) reduced the mean volume of peritumoral tissue irradiated when compared with static collimator optimization (Strategy 2), by 16.1% (95% CI +/- 1.5) at 95% isodose, by 11.7% (95% CI +/- 1) at 90% isodose, and by 8.2% (95% CI +/- 1.2) at 80% isodose regions. In specific cases, linear or polynomial functions were formulated to optimize collimator settings dynamically throughout treatment arcs. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic collimator optimization during arc-based SRS decreases the volume of healthy peritumoral tissue treated with high doses of radiation and appears to be an effective method of improving target conformality. This study is the first step toward determination of a smoothing function algorithm to allow for true dynamic collimation during SRS	
1964	A system for three-dimensional dosimetric verification of treatment plans in intensity-modulated radiotherapy with heavy ions	Arm, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Computer Simulation, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Reproducibility of Results, Water	The introduction of dynamic intensity modulation into radiotherapy using conventional photon beams or scanning particle beams requires additional and efficient methods of dose verification. Dose measurements in dynamically generated dose distributions with a single ionization chamber require a complete application of the treatment field for each single measurement. Therefore measurements are performed by simultaneous use of multiple ionization chambers. The measurement is performed by a computer controlled system and is comprised of the following steps: (a) automated positioning of the ionization chambers, (b) measurement at these points, (c) a comparison with the calculated dose from the treatment planning system, and (d) documentation of the measurement. The ionization chambers are read out by a multichannel electrometer and are densely packed into a mounting of polymethylmetacrylate, which is attached to the arm of a three-dimensional motor-driven water phantom. The measured and planned dose values are displayed numerically as well as graphically. The mean deviation between measured and planned doses as well as their standard deviation are calculated and displayed. Through printouts complete documentation of the measurement is obtained and a quick decision can be made whether the dose distribution is acceptable for the patient. The system is now routinely used for dose verification at the heavy ion therapy project at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. Up to now 242 measurements have been performed for heavy ion treatment of 30 patients. The system allows efficient verification and documentation of carbon ion fields and is in principle also applicable to intensity-modulated photon beams	
3317	Measurements of backscattered radiation from Therac-20 collimator and trimmer jaws into beam monitor chamber	Head, Humans, Jaw, Lead, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Monitoring/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Scattering,Radiation, Universities	The field size dependent photon output is known to be influenced by the existence of backscattered radiation (BSR) generated in the collimator or trimmer jaws of a linear accelerator. This paper describes the results of measurements made to study the existence of such backscatter by simulating the geometry of the treatment head of a Therac-20 linear accelerator. The machine's monitor chamber, flattening filter, and collimator jaws were simulated by another real monitor chamber, a 1-cm thick lead sheet and 2.5-cm thick low-melting-point alloy divergent blocks, respectively. BSR from the simulated collimator jaws (SCJ) was measured with the simulated monitor chamber (SMC) as a function of the openings of the SCJ and as a function of distance between SMC and SCJ. The present results demonstrate the presence of BSR in an 18-MV photon beam from a Therac-20 linear accelerator

Randomized trials demonstrated similar overall survival between mastectomy and breast-conservative surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). BCS plus adjuvant RT +/- systemic therapy has become the standard of care for women with early breast cancer. Advances in modern RT technology allowed significant increase in high precision of target definition. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and gating, under investigation in miscellaneous cancers, are also in development for breast-cancer patients. These techniques decrease radiation toxicities and could be useful in the setting of concurrent use of RT and new systemic therapies such as trastuzumab. Another advance in RT is the development of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as a new concept in the adjuvant setting for early-stage breast cancer. Intraoperative RT (IORT), immediate postoperative RT (interstitial brachytherapy or Mammosite device implantation) and delayed postoperative RT (external beam of photons or protons with 3D conformation) are under investigation. In this review, the role of modern whole breast irradiation is discussed, the rational of partial breast irradiation is argued and the different techniques are detailed. [References: 46]

Analysis of early and late side effects and complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, early and late complications were assessed in 50 patients as a function of hypoxyradiotherapeutic dose increase. The preliminary treatment results of this radiotherapeutic modification were evaluated after a median follow-up of 48 months using Kaplen-Meier analysis. Between April 1991 and February 1997, 50 patients (36 men and 14 women) with colorectal carcinoma were treated preoperatively with locoregional accelerated hypofractionated hypoxyradiotherapy. The extent of disease was classified according to Dukes' criteria (A: four patients, B. 28 patients, C: 18 patients). We used a 20-MeV linear accelerator with two parallel opposed fields. Hypoxyradiotherapy was performed extending from the perineum to the L4 region. Acute hypoxia was induced during irradiation by ventilation of a hypoxic gas mixture containing 7.8-8.0% oxygen. Total doses of 24 Gy/8 days, 28 Gy/9 days, and 32 Gy/10 days were applied in five, 20, and 25 patients, respectively. Low anterior resection or abdominoperineal amputation of the rectum was performed the day after completion of preoperative hypoxyradiotherapy. The early reactions after irradiation were evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute (CTC-NCI). RESULTS: Early postirradiation proctitis was documented in three and early radiation-induced cystitis in two patients only. Neither early nor late radiation-associated complications were observed in any of the three hypoxyradiotherapy schedules during the follow-up period of 6-105 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (median 48 months), a 5-year overall survival rate of 61.5% and a local relapse-free survival rate of 84.2% can be expected. Treatment failures were predominantly systemic. CONCLUSION: We believe it can be concluded that acute hypoxia has a radioprotective effect on normal tissues during accelerated hypoxyradiotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. Hypoxyradiotherapy permits safe administration of doses higher than those tolerated by normoxic, noncanceorus tissue, resulting in the amplification of the biological effect of radiation on tumor tissue and contributing to an improved outcome after combined radiosurgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma

We describe the methods developed for stereotactic neuroradiological imaging and stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery in the evaluation and treatment of the first 55 patients with deep AVMs in a clinical research protocol. We discuss the diagnosis and epidemiological characteristics of the diseases, the neurosurgical and radiosurgical methods of treatment available and the initial experience of stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery , including stereotactic neuroradiological evaluation, treatment planning, heavy-ion beams, patient treatment protocol, early clinical results, patient evaluation and follow-up studies planned, and conclusions thus far obtained

Twenty-one of the 28 patients (75%) achieved at least a partial local response. There were 9 patients (32%) who achieved a complete response and 12 patients (43%) who achieved a partial response. The responses were 9/11 for squamous cell carcinoma, 5/10 for adenocarcinoma, 5/5 for large cell carcinoma, and 2/2 for small cell carcinoma patients. Treatment was very well tolerated and in fact, no acute radiation related complications were observed during the 10-12 week treatment duration. Radiation induced fibrosis of various degrees has occurred but it has been mostly asymptomatic and similar to what is normally seen using conventional continuous schedules. In this group of very advanced lung cancer patients, failures have mostly resulted from metastatic progression; only one patient progressed locally in the irradiated field without evidence of metastatic disease. A preliminary analysis indicates that this treatment yields results that are similar to those achieved with conventional fractionation regimens and should be explored further	
4069	Electron beam effective source surface distances for a high energy linear accelerator	Calibration, Head, Humans, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The design of the Varian Clinac 1800 linear accelerator electron applicator system does not allow clearance for all head and neck patients to be treated at the standard calibration distance of 100 cm. Discrepancies have been found between dose calculations using the inverse square law for extended distances and their measured data. A 4 X 4 cm2 applicator at an energy of 9 MeV, for example, had dose differences of 13 and 23% at distances of 105 and 110 cm SSD. Because of these discrepancies, effective source surface distances (SSDeff) were determined for all the standard electron energies and applicators of a Clinac 1800. These effective source surface distances ranged from 41.6 cm to 92.6 cm for the 4 X 4 cm2 cone/6 MeV electron beam through the 25 X 25 cm2 cone/20 MeV electron beam. A summary of these distances and an analysis of the clinical use of both a best fit SSDeff and a common SSDeff for patient dosimetry calculations is presented

This means the target volumes in the head and neck region are sometimes too wide for standard width-modulated fields to provide adequate dose coverage. A solution is to set up asymmetric co-axial overlapping fields. This protects the MLC carriage while in return the MLC provides modulated dose blending in the field overlap region. Planar dose maps for coincident fields from the Pinnacle radiotherapy treatment planning system are compared with planar dose maps reconstructed from radiographic film and electronic portal images. The film and portal images show small leaf-jaw matchlines at each field overlap border. Linear profiles taken across each image show that the observed leaf-jaw matchlines from the accelerator images are not accounted for by the treatment planning system. Dose difference between film reconstructed electronic portal images and planning system are about 2.5 cGy in a modulated field at d(max). While the magnitude of the dose differences are small improved round end leaf modelling combined with a finer dose calculation grid may minimize the discrepancy between calculated and delivered dose	
2093	Chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull: a clinicopathologic study of 200 cases with emphasis on its distinction from chordoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Boston, Child, Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Radiation, Recurrence, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Rate	Conventional chondrosarcoma (CSA) of the skull base is an uncommon neoplasm that can resemble chordoma, and indeed it is misdiagnosed frequently as such. This has important clinical implications, because when treated with similar aggressive treatment strategies, CSA has a much better prognosis than chordoma. In an effort to identify those morphologic and immunohistochemical features that help to identify conventional skull base CSA correctly and to understand its prognosis better, particularly compared with chordoma, when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, the authors performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 200 CSAs. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 79 years (mean, 39 years), 87 patients were male and 113 patients were female, and most presented with symptoms related to the central nervous system. Approximately 6% of the tumors arose in the sphenoethmoid complex, 28% originated in the clivus, and 66% developed in the temperooccipital junction. Histologically, 15 tumors (7.5%) were classified as hyaline CSA, 59 (29.5%) as myxoid CSA, and 126 (63%) as mixed hyaline and myxoid CSA. A total of 101 (50.5%) tumors were grade 1, 57 (28.5%) had areas of grades 1 and 2, and 42 (21%) were pure grade 2 neoplasms. The vast majority of patients originated from referring hospitals, and the diagnosis was changed prospectively at our institution to CSA from chordoma in 74 patients (37%). Of the tumors studied immunohistochemically, 96 of 97 (98.9%) stained for S-100 protein, 0 of 97 (0%) stained for keratin, and faint staining for epithelial membrane antigen was seen in 7 of 88 tumors (7.95%). All patients underwent high-dose postoperative fractionated precision conformal radiation therapy with a dose that ranged from 64.2 to 79.6 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents (median, 72.1 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents, given in 38 fractions. The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%. In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively. CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management

The cavity is defined to confine irradiation to the hand and modifies the neutron spectrum produced by a low energy accelerator neutron source to optimize activation per dose. Neutron and gamma-ray dose rates were measured with the microdosimetric technique using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter at the hand irradiation site and inside the hand access hole. For the outside of the cavity, a spherical neutron dose equivalent meter and a Farmer dosemeter were employed instead due to the low intensity of the radiation field. The maximum dose equivalent rate at the outside of the cavity was 2.94 microSv/100 microA min, which is lower by a factor of 1/2260 than the dose rate at the hand irradiation position. The local dose contributions from a hand, an arm and the rest of a body to the effective dose rate were estimated to be 1.73, 0.782 and 2.94 microSv/100 microA min, respectively. For the standard irradiation protocol of the in vivo hand activation, 300 microA min, an effective dose of 16.3 microSv would be delivered

These studies were also helpful for commissioning the beam delivery performance of the facility. The calculations included preventing proton leakage from the beam delivery nozzle, anomalies in the dose distributions and studies, which could influence future beam delivery techniques. Using simulations it was possible to reduce the proton leakage by over an order of magnitude, while minimizing the weight of the assembly. Interestingly, the thickness of the brass shielding has no influence on the secondary neutron radiation since the number of generated neutrons is almost independent of the amount of brass if the primary beam is completely stopped. Monte Carlo simulations are able to study the effect of small beam misalignments with respect to apertures in the nozzle. Such tolerances are very difficult to define experimentally. Studying the effects of nuclear interactions we showed that, if the dose distributions would be optimized theoretically using the primary proton dose alone, there would be about a 5 % dose increase at the proximal end of a SOBP. In radiobiology studies we found that the RBE at beam entrance increases due to the build-up of the secondary particle fluence	
2700	Future directions in hyperthermia biology. [Review] [32 refs]	Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage], Combined Modality Therapy, Drug Delivery Systems, Free Radicals, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Hyperthermia,Induced/mt [Methods], Hyperthermia,Induced/td [Trends], Lead, Neoplasms/bs [Blood Supply], Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Regional Blood Flow, Research, Temperature, Universities	Eric Hall pointed out many years ago that in hyperthermia the biology is with us, but the physics is against us. Over the years the basic truth in that statement has not wavered. Our best evidence suggests that temperature distributions are 1-1.5 degrees C too low, on average. However, investigations in biology may lead to sensitization of tumours to hyperthermia, even with the temperatures that are already achievable in the clinic. Biologists are now starting to realize that more studies need to be done in the temperature range between 37 and 42 degrees C, since this is the range that is most often reached in the clinic. For example, Dr Hahn coined the term hyperthermic sensitizer for those drugs that are not cytotoxic at 37 degrees C, but have observable cytotoxicity at elevated temperatures. A new class of hyperthermic sensitizers, azo-dihydrochlorides, decompose in aqueous media to release free radicals. Almost no cytotoxicity of these drugs is observed at 37 degrees C, but the drugs are exquisitely cytotoxic at temperatures of 41-42 degrees C. Identification of additional compounds with such properties is warranted, since systemic cytotoxicity could be avoided. Hahn also suggested that the increase in blood flow that occurs in tumours during heating could be exploited as a means to increase drug delivery. Use of this approach to enhance delivery of monoclonal antibodies has proven fruitful. Since long duration heating combined with low dose-rate irradiation leads to obliteration of the radiation dose-rate effect, this approach may be particularly advantageous with monoclonal antibodies radiolabelled with low LET isotopes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 32]

A reference dose was determined from the fluence of particles by counting individual particles. A parallel-plate Markus chamber with a small sensitive air volume was used for beam dosimetry applying the ICRU protocol. The doses measured with the ionization chamber were compared with doses evaluated from the fluence measurements. Alternative dose measurements were performed using MTS-N LiF:Mg, Ti thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) and a photometrically evaluated Fricke chemical dosimeter. An uncertainty of 8% was found in the determination of the dose relative to the reference method. Effects of an inhomogeneous energy loss and a finite track length of the projectiles in the sensitive detector volume of the dosimeters had to be taken into account	
2026	Respiratory gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy	Carbon, Diaphragm, Fluoroscopy, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Light, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Motion, Movement, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: In order to reduce the treatment margin of the moving target due to breathing, we developed a gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The motion of a patient due to respiration is detected by the motion of the body surface around the chest wall. A respiratory sensor was developed using an infrared light spot and a position-sensitive detector. A timing signal to request a beam is generated in response to the respiration waveform, and a carbon beam is extracted from the synchrotron using a RF-knockout method. CT images for treatment planning are taken in synchronization with the respiratory motion. For patient positioning, digitized fluoroscopic images superimposed with the respiration waveform were used. The relation between the respiratory sensor signal and the organ motion was examined using digitized video images from fluoroscopy. The performance of our gated system was demonstrated by using the moving phantom, and dose profiles were measured in the direction of phantom motion. RESULTS: The timing of gate-on is set at the end of the expiratory phase, because the motion of the diaphragm is slower and more reproducible than during the inspiratory phase. The signal of the respiratory sensor shows a phase difference of 120 milliseconds between lower and upper locations on the chest wall. The motion of diaphragm is delayed by 200 milliseconds from the respiration waveform at the lower location. The beam extraction system worked according to the beam on/off logic for gating, and the gated CT scanner performed well. The lateral penumbra size of the dose profile along the moving axis was distinguishably decreased by the gated irradiation. The ratio of the nongated to gated lateral fall-off was 4.3, 3.5, and 2. 0 under the stroke of 40.0, 29.0, and 13.0 mm respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed a total treatment system of gated irradiation for heavy-ion radiotherapy. We found that with this system the target margin along the body axis could be decreased to 5-10 mm although the target moved twice or three times. Over 150 patients with lung or liver cancer had already been treated by this gated irradiation system by the end of July 1999

[Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver/pp [Physiopathology], Male, Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Science, Universities	Seventy-five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were treated with proton beams from 1983-1993 at the Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. For the purpose of confirming the feasibility of proton therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, we investigated the influence of proton therapy on liver function and also tried to evaluate the possibility of optimization using dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. The results indicated that proton therapy did not cause clinically symptomatic damage in liver function and the only notable change after proton therapy was the transient increase of transminase. DVH analysis showed that this transient increase of transaminase was well correlated to the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). These results indicate that localized high dose radiation using proton beams is feasible for the treatment of liver cancers and optimization of this treatment may be possible using DVH analysis

Thirty-four patients with histologically proven astrocytoma WHO II-IV after treatment by FSRT and a new suspect lesion in the follow-up were included in this study. Data were analysed by three independent radiologists with different experience in 1H SI: Data were verified by clinical follow-up (PT, progressive tumour; nPT, non-progressive tumour) and a kappa analysis was performed. Sensitivity and specificity of T1 weighted (w) and T2w MRI was compared (imaging at radiotherapy and follow-up) using further follow-up controls as gold standard and the additional benefit of 1H SI (imaging at follow-up) was calculated. Mean interval between last irradiation and detection of a suspicious lesion was 37 +/- 32 months. Time to clinical evaluation was 13 +/- 8 months. Interobserver agreement was significantly high in all analyses (kappa always >0.8, P < 0.05). T2w imaging proved to be superior to contrast enhanced T1w imaging in sensitivity (87.5 vs 81.25%) and specificity (85.7 vs 57.1%). Solitary 1H SI had similar results as T2w (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 71.4%). Taking all techniques into account, all PT were correctly diagnosed. Radiologists' experience had no significant influence on correct interpretation of a suspicious lesion. We conclude that 1H SI is helpful in characterising new suspicious lesions in irradiated gliomas, particularly if pre-MRI is not available for evaluating follow-up

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1989 through July 2000, 225 patients with HCC underwent their first course of proton beam therapy at the University of Tsukuba. Of them, 27 with 68 lesions who had undergone two or more courses were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Median interval between the first and second course was 24.5 months (range 3.3-79.8 months). Median total dose of 72 Gy in 16 fractions and 66 Gy in 16 fractions were given for the first course and the rest of the courses, respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate and median survival period from the beginning of the first course for the 27 patients were 55.6% and 62.2 months, respectively. Five-year local control rate for the 68 lesions was 87.8%. Of the patients, 1 with Child-Pugh class B and another with class C before the last course suffered from acute hepatic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated proton beam therapy for HCC is safe when the patient has a target in the peripheral region of the liver and liver function is Child-Pugh class A

Clones surviving irradiation and control clones were analyzed for 17 characteristics including chromosomal aberrations, growth defects, alterations in response to a second irradiation, and mutant frequencies at the thymidine kinase and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase loci. Putative unstable clones were defined as those that exhibited a significant alteration in one or more characteristics compared to the controls. The frequency and characteristics of the unstable clones were compared in clones exposed to (137)Cs gamma rays or (56)Fe particles. The majority of the unstable clones isolated after exposure to either gamma rays or (56)Fe particles exhibited chromosomal instability. Alterations in growth characteristics, radiation response and mutant frequencies occurred much less often than cytogenetic alterations in these unstable clones. The frequency and complexity of the unstable clones were greater after exposure to (56)Fe particles than to gamma rays. Unstable clones that survived 36 generations after exposure to gamma rays exhibited increases in the incidence of dicentric chromosomes but not of chromatid breaks, whereas unstable clones that survived 36 generations after exposure to (56)Fe particles exhibited increases in both chromatid and chromosome aberrations

At St. Vincentius Hospital in Karlsruhe the percentage of electron treated patients grew up in the years from 15% to 45%. Electron energies between 7 and 12 MeV are the most commonly used. Major RT Centres need a wider range of energies (5/7-20 MeV), but the minor ones should have at least electron beams of 5-12/15 MeV

The dramatic technical developments in radiotherapy have enabled greater accuracy and reliability based on three-dimensional imaging for both planning and verification. Particle therapy, in particular using protons, provides further opportunities for optimising radiation delivery and dose escalation. Novel fractionation schedules with both hyperfractionation and hypofractionation may have added benefits. Chemoradiation has been shown in one randomised-controlled trial to improve the results of radiotherapy alone, and requires further investigation. Hypoxia modification using carbogen and nicotinamide has also shown promising results in a phase II trial, and is now in phase III evaluation. Novel drug agents for bladder cancer are few, but the anti-EGFR agents and anti-angiogenic agents may have promise; the development of anti-apoptotic agents and antisense gene therapy may also become a component of the future multimodality management of this tumour.

For describing mammalian cellular inactivation two inactivation modes are required, called gamma-kill and ion-kill, the first due to synergistic effects of delta rays from adjacent ion paths thus resembling the effects from gamma rays, and the second to the effects of single ion transits through a cell nucleus. The ion-kill effect is more severe, where the fraction of cells experiencing ion kill is responsible for a decrease in the oxygen enhancement ratio, and an increase in relative biological effectiveness, but these are accompanied by loss of repair, hence to a reduction in the efficiency of fractionation in high LET therapy, as shown by our calculations for radiobiological effects in the "spread out Bragg Peak".

2602	Reduction of the "horns" observed on the beam profiles of a 6-MV linear accelerator	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic	The presence of large "horns" was found while plotting beam profiles during acceptance testing of a 6-MV linear accelerator. The in-phantom off-axis ratio (OAR), measured at 22 cm off the central axis along the diagonal of a 40 X 40 cm field at dmax was found to be 1.19, while beam uniformity was within specifications at 10-cm depth. A change in the gun injection voltage and the replacement of the magnet surrounding the magnetron with one of greater strength resulted in a reduction of the OAR to 1.085. The beam uniformity at depth was maintained within specifications. An alternative solution of adding a modifying filter in the primary beam was considered undesirable because of the 20%-25% reduction in dose rate caused by such filters. The relationship between the energy, the intensity distribution of the beam, and the magnitude of the horns is discussed, and the beam profiles, isodoses, and central axis depth doses before and after the changes are compared

4548	Scatter factors in proton therapy with a broad beam	Calibration, Humans, Japan, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Scattering,Radiation, Water, Water/ch [Chemistry]	In the absence of a predictor of beam output in proton therapy using a broad beam, the beam output is obtained for individual treatments by calibrating the beam monitors. The calibration is carried out under conditions similar to the treatment conditions but with a phantom instead of the patient. However, the dose in the phantom a priori differs from that in the patient. In order to deliver the accurate dose, a correction factor has been introduced to correct the difference. This correction factor is referred to as a scatter factor in an analogy with photon therapy, and is defined as the ratio of the dose at the prescription point in the patient to the dose at the calibration point in the phantom. Under the calibration conditions at Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center (HIBMC), the range compensator and the collimator, which are usually required in proton therapy with a broad beam, are not used. Therefore the scatter factor includes the effects of the devices as well as the difference between the dose in the patient and that in the phantom. We have developed an estimator using a dose calculation based on the pencil beam algorithm and implemented it in a treatment planning system (TPS) for clinical use. This estimator estimates the scatter factor by calculating the ratio of the doses under the same conditions in the TPS. In order to evaluate the performance of the estimator, demonstrations were carried out for cases with measurable outcomes using a gantry nozzle at HIBMC. We observed 2-3% differences between the measurements and the estimations. These differences were considered to result from the limitations of the dose calculation algorithm in modelling the beam and the patient	
4131	Is there life after technetium: what is the potential for developing new broad-based radionuclides?. [Review] [78 refs]	Biochemistry, Diagnostic Imaging, Gamma Rays, Humans, Isotopes, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nuclear Medicine, Nuclear Medicine/td [Trends], Particle Accelerators, Positron-Emission Tomography, Radioimmunotherapy/td [Trends], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/du [Diagnostic Use], Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radionuclide Imaging/td [Trends], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Research, Technetium, Technetium/du [Diagnostic Use], Tomography,Emission-Computed/td [Trends], United States	The use of radionuclides for medical and for a multitude of other basic research applications has continued to grow at a very rapid pace. Procedures, based on their use as radiotracers for nuclear medicine imaging and for radiotherapy of cancer and other pathology, have become firmly established as important clinical modalities. It is estimated that on an annual basis in the United States alone, radionuclides are used medically in over 13 million imaging procedures, in over 100 million laboratory tests, and in an ever increasing number (> 100,000) for therapeutic administrations. One out of every four hospital patients undergoes a procedure that involves the use of radionuclides. Diagnostic imaging methods using planar/single-photon emission computed tomography and positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging, as well as the measurement of in vivo organ function, physiology, or biochemistry, have become indispensable tools in patient workup and management. More than 80% of all imaging studies (mostly anatomic) currently use technetium-99m (99mTc), because it has turned out to be the ideal isotope from various considerations. However, over the past few years, nuclear medicine has experienced a slow but steady evolution towards functional studies, quantitative PET imaging, and novel therapeutic approaches. New radionuclides are required for these applications, and their development has attracted considerable interest. This article reviews the current status and future prospects for the development of many new potential isotopes. Practical issues, such as the feasibility of large-scale production and wide-spread availability in a continuous reliable fashion, are addressed. To date, the data are not sufficient to answer the question as to whether any of these radionuclides (or their applications, for that matter) will eventually assume as broad-based a role as that of 99mTc. Nonetheless, there are a number of promising radionuclides that could assume an important place in the future practice of nuclear medicine. [References: 78]

This information makes the treatment planning for proton and heavy-ion radiotherapy more precise. We have started a feasibility study on dual energy x-ray CT by using synchrotron radiation. A translation-rotation scanning CT system was developed for quantitative measurement in order to clarify what precision in the measurement was achieved. Liquid samples of solutions of K2HPO4 and solid samples of tissue equivalent materials were used to simulate human tissue. The experiments were carried out using monochromatic x-rays with energies of 40, 70 and 80 keV produced by monochromatizing synchrotron radiation. The solid samples were also measured in a complementary method using high-energy carbon beams to evaluate the electron densities. The measured electron densities were compared with the theoretical values or the values measured in the complementary method. It was found that these values were in agreement in 0.9% on average. Effective atomic numbers were obtained as well from dual-energy x-ray CT. The tomographic image based on each of the electron densities and the effective atomic number presents a different feature of the material, and its contrast drastically differs from that in a conventional CT image	
3675	Neutrons from high-energy x-ray medical accelerators: an estimate of risk to the radiotherapy patient. [Review] [55 refs]	Abnormalities,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Equipment Safety, Humans, Incidence, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Risk, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	The problem of neutrons produced by many of the high-energy x-ray therapy machines (10 MV and above) is reviewed, and the possible risk their presence poses to radiotherapy patients is estimated. A review of the regulatory background containing a summary of the recommendations of the U.S. Council of State Governments (USCSG), and of the International Electro-Technical Commission (IEC), as well as an indication that recommendations will be forthcoming from the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) and the International Commission of Radiological Protection (ICRP) is presented. The neutrons in question are produced by high-energy photons (x rays) incident on the various materials of the target, flattening filter, collimators, and other essential components of the equipment. The neutron yield (per treatment dose) increases rapidly as the megavoltage is increased from 10 to 20 MV, but remains approximately constant above this. Measurements and calculations of the quantity, quality, and spatial distribution of these neutrons and their concomitant dose are summarized. Values of the neutron dose are presented as entrance dose, midline dose (10-cm depth), and integral dose, both within and outside of the treatment volume. These values are much less than the unavoidable photon doses which are largely responsible for treatment side effects. For typical equipment, the average neutron integral dose from accelerator-produced neutrons is about 4-7 g cGy (per treatment cGy), depending on the treatment plan. This translates into an average dose of neutrons [averaged over the body of a typical 70-kg (154 lb) patient] of 0.06-0.10 cGy for a treatment of 1000 cGy. Using these neutron doses and the best available neutron risk coefficients, it is estimated that 50 X 10(-6) fatal malignancies per year due to the neutrons may follow a typical treatment course of 5000 rads of 25-MV x rays. This is only about 1/60th of the average incidence of malignancies for the general population. Thus, the cancer risk to the radiotherapy patient from accelerator-produced neutrons poses an additional risk to the patient that is negligible in comparison. [References: 55]

Dose increase is expected at tissue-air boundaries, due to the electron return effect (ERE): electrons entering air will describe a circular path and return into the phantom causing extra dose deposition. Using IMRT with many beam directions, this exit dose will not constitute a problem. Dose levels behind air cavities will decrease because of the absence of electrons crossing the cavity. The ERE has been demonstrated both by simulation and experiment. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with GEANT4, irradiating a water-air-water phantom in a lateral magnetic field. Also an air tube in water has been simulated, resulting in slightly twisted regions of dose increase and decrease. Experimental demonstration is achieved by film measurement in a perspex-air-perspex phantom in an electromagnet. Although the ERE causes dose increase before air cavities, relatively flat dose profiles can be obtained for the investigated cases using opposite beam configurations. More research will be necessary whether this holds for more realistic geometries with the use of IMRT and whether the ERE can be turned to our advantage when treating small tumour sites at air cavities	
939	The clinical potential of intensity modulated proton therapy	Humans, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Safety, Switzerland	Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) differs from conventional proton therapy in its ability to deliver depth-shifted, arbitrarily complex proton fluence maps from each incident field direction. As the individual Bragg peaks delivered from any field can be distributed in three-dimensions throughout the target volume, IMPT provides many more degrees of freedom for designing dose distributions than IMRT or conventional proton therapy techniques. So how can the flexibility of IMPT best be exploited? Here we argue that IMPT has two main advantages over photon IMRT and conventional proton therapy: the ability to better 'sculpt' the dose to the target and around neighbouring critical structures, and the ability to find clinically acceptable solutions whilst simultaneously reducing the sensitivity of the treatments to potential delivery errors. The concept of IMPT as a tool for generating 'safer' plans opens an interesting new avenue of research from the point of view of plan optimisation, the potential of which is only just beginning to be explored

The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision

The studies have demonstrated that a diet consisting of only dehydrated food products can be used for a prolonged time (up to 1 year). Dehydrated foods after a 2-year storage and proton irradiation at a dose of 24,000 rad retain their biological value and assure an adequate nutritional status. On this basis a space diet composed of dehydrated foods has been developed	
1053	Changes in G1-phase populations in human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines influence p66/Be neutron-induced micronucleus yield	Beryllium, Beryllium/pd [Pharmacology], Cell Cycle, Cell Line, Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Energy Transfer, Flow Cytometry, G1 Phase/re [Radiation Effects], Glioblastoma/pa [Pathology], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Kinetics, Linear Energy Transfer, Micronuclei,Chromosome-Defective/re [Radiation Effects], Micronucleus Tests, Neuroblastoma/pa [Pathology], Neuroblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiation Tolerance, Radiobiology, Research, Survival, Time Factors	Some photon resistant tumours are sensitive to neutrons but no predictive methods exist which could identify such tumours. In a recent study addressing this clinically important issue, we demonstrated that relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) values for p(66)/Be neutrons estimated from micronucleus (MN) data correlate positively with RBE values obtained from conventional clonogenic survival data. However, not all photon-resistant cell lines showed high RBE values when the MN endpoint was used. Now, we examine how the functional status of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and radiation-induced changes in cell cycle phase populations may contribute to this discrepancy. No significant association was established between p53 status and MN yield for both photon and neutron irradiation. The data demonstrated that neutron-, but not photon-, induced MN yield is dependent on the intrinsic ability of cells to activate a G1-phase arrest. In cell lines of comparable photon sensitivity, those showing more extensive depletion of the G1 population express significantly more micronuclei per unit dose of neutrons. These results suggest that differences in cell cycle kinetics, and not the p53 status, may constitute an important factor in damage induction by high linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation and need to be considered when radiation toxicity in clinical radiobiology or radiation protection is assessed using damage endpoints

Although available in only certain locations and beneficial for only selected cases, Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) represent exciting and revolutionary techniques of providing more concise doses of radiation to specifically targeted volumes while minimizing radiation to surrounding non-target tissues. IMRT and SRS, therefore, theoretically can improve control rates while lowering toxicity of radiation treatment. While the technology is less expensive and less logistically challenging than machines for neutron and proton delivery, increased time for treatment planning and quality assurance, financial feasibility and cost-effectiveness remain significant issues and have therefore limited more widespread application. Research continues on the use of chemotherapy and biologic modifiers to alter cell sensitivity to radiation, decrease side effects, and improve the therapeutic ratio. Potential applications are expanding for use of brachytherapy to prevent restenosis and in the treatment of brain, breast, and prostate neoplasms, but are presently limited by lack of mature studies and reimbursement issues. Due to the high costs of radiotherapy technology acquisition and equipment maintenance, increasing staff salaries and tenuous reimbursement environment, care should be taken to avoid unnecessary duplication of services in the community

METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas and 8 had diffuse choroidal hemangiomas (DCH) and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Of the patients, 19 were treated with photons with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy. A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All patients with DCH but 1 were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of all patients. Tumor thickness decreased in 95.4% and retinal detachment resolved in 92.9%. Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected. In all, 40.9% showed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, maximum Grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity. Retinopathy and radiation-induced optic neuropathy were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely. No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected. Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects should be part of the follow-up procedures

Studied treatments are: head and neck (cancer of the larynx), breast (breast cancer), brain (brain tumours) and pelvis (cervix-uterine cancer). Experimental determinations were made using ionization chambers and thermoluminescent dosimeters, at different locations in phantoms, for blocked and unblocked fields. Calculated absorbed doses, using the treatment planning system and Clarkson method, were compared to those measured. Measured transmission factor values ranged from 5% to 18%. It was found that the planning treatment system may underestimate the absorbed dose under the blocks, up to 35%

METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1998, a total of 58 patients who could be evaluated were treated for skull base tumors, 33 for chordoma and 25 for chondrosarcoma. Following various surgical procedures, residual tumor was detected in 91% of patients; 59% demonstrated brainstem involvement. Target dosages ranged from 64.8 and 79.2 (mean 70.7) Co Gy equivalent. The range of follow up was 7 to 75 months (mean 33 months). In 10 patients (17%) the treatment failed locally, resulting in local control rates of 92% (23 of 25 patients) for chondrosarcomas and 76% (25 of 33 patients) for chordomas. Tumor volume and brainstem involvement influenced control rates. All tumors with volumes of 25 ml or less remained locally controlled, compared with 56% of tumors larger than 25 ml (p = 0.02); 94% of patients without brainstem involvement did not experience recurrence; in patients with brainstem involvement (and dose reduction because of brainstem tolerance constraints) the authors achieved a tumor control rate of 53% (p = 0.04). Three patients died of their disease, and one died of intercurrent disease. Actuarial 5-year survival rates were 100% for patients with chondrosarcoma and 79% for patients with chordoma. Grade 3 and 4 late toxicities were observed in four patients (7%) and were symptomatic in three (5%). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose proton RT offers excellent chances of lasting tumor control and survival, with acceptable risks. In this series all small- and medium-sized tumors with no demonstrable brainstem involvement have been controlled; all such patients are alive. Surgical debulking enhanced delivery of full tumoricidal doses, but even patients with large tumors and disease abutting crucial normal structures benefited

We hypothesized, however, that many of the key concepts would be better conveyed by an interactive computer model utilizing virtual reality technology. We describe the implementation, using Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), of such a model, the Proton Therapy Concepts Demonstrator (PTCD). The World-Wide-Web-accessible PTCD is intended to provide information useful both to trainee and to qualified clinical staff and also to patients. A model was created of the radiotherapy room that was linked to an interactive model depicting a simple explanation of the process of proton eye radiotherapy. This model also allows the user to explore specific elements of the treatment planning and delivery process, such as beam collimation and range modulation. A further level of detail has been provided by a dynamic model demonstrating how a specific modulated dose distribution is achieved as the time integration of discrete modulated Bragg peaks. We believe this VR-based model has the potential of enabling users to gain more rapid insight into the proton therapy process. Its development as an educational tool is continuing, following feedback collected from clinical staff and patients	
2033	Dose- and time-response relationships for lethal mutations and chromosomal instability induced by ionizing radiation in an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Apoptosis, Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects], Cell Line, Chromosomal Instability, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Efficiency, Gamma Rays/ae [Adverse Effects], Genomic Instability, Humans, Ireland, Keratinocytes/cy [Cytology], Keratinocytes/me [Metabolism], Keratinocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Mutation, Phenotype, Radiation, Time	PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between two well-established delayed effects of ionizing radiation, experiments were conducted to determine the induction and expression of lethal mutations (delayed reproductive death) and chromosomal instability with respect to dose and time in a human immortalized keratinocyte cell line. METHODS: HPV-G cells were gamma- or alpha-irradiated and maintained in culture for up to 72 population doublings. At intervals, measurements were made of cloning efficiency and the cells examined for apoptosis and cytogenetic aberrations. RESULTS: The descendants of cells surviving 1 or 3 Gy gamma-irradiation, but not 0.5 Gy gamma-irradiation, exhibited a reduced colony-forming efficiency. The reduction persisted at a constant rate of 15-20% clonogenic cell loss per population doubling for up to 72 population doublings. Apoptosis was demonstrated in all colonies in the 1 and 3 Gy groups at 30 and 72 population doublings post-irradiation but not in the 0.5 Gy group. A significant persistent reduction in colony-forming ability (approximately 80%) was demonstrated in the progeny of cells irradiated with 0.5 Gy alpha-particles. After 30 population doublings, the proportion of chromosomally aberrant cells was significantly greater than control values for all doses of both high- and low-LET radiations. The major cytogenetic aberrations (chromatid breaks, chromosome fragments and minutes) were consistent with the transmission of chromosomal instability. The expression of instability declined between 30 and 72 population doublings in the 0.5 Gy and 3 Gy gamma-irradiation groups, but persisted up to 72 population doublings in the 1 Gy group. The expression of chromosomal instability was greater in the descendants of alpha-irradiated cells and showed little evidence of reduction with time. CONCLUSIONS: Unstable aberrations characteristic of radiation-induced chromosomal instability may commonly result in apoptosis and account for a component of the delayed reproductive death/lethal mutation phenotype in HPV-G cells. However, the absence of lethal mutations in the descendants of 0.5 Gy gamma-irradiated cells indicates a low-LET threshold effect for this particular endpoint. Overall, and particularly at low doses, there is no direct correlation between the two endpoints, indicating the absence of a simple relationship between these manifestations of radiation-induced genomic instability	
1917	A preliminary study of the prognostic value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in gamma knife radiosurgery of recurrent malignant gliomas	Adult, Aged, Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Astrocytoma/di [Diagnosis], Astrocytoma/mo [Mortality], Astrocytoma/su [Surgery], California, Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Female, Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/di [Diagnosis], Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/su [Surgery], Humans, Lactic Acid/me [Metabolism], Lipid Metabolism, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Prognosis, Radiosurgery, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Universities	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging as a prognostic indicator in gamma knife radiosurgery of recurrent gliomas. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery, and with conventional magnetic resonance imaging examinations at regular time intervals until the initiation of a new treatment strategy. Patients were categorized on the basis of their initial spectroscopic results, and their performance was assessed in terms of change in contrast-enhancing volume, time to further treatment, and survival. RESULTS: The trends in the overall population were toward more extensive increase in the percent contrast-enhancing volume, a decreased time to further treatment, and a reduced survival time for patients with more extensive initial metabolic abnormalities. Statistical analysis of the subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme found a significant increase in relative contrast-enhancing volume (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), a decrease in time to further treatment (P < 0.01, log-rank test), and a reduction in survival time (P < 0.01, log-rank test) for patients with regions containing tumor-suggestive spectra outside the gamma knife target, compared with patients exhibiting spectral abnormalities restricted to the gamma knife target. Further studies are needed to establish statistical significance for patients with lower-grade lesions and to confirm the results observed in this study. CONCLUSION: The pretreatment spectroscopic results provided information that was predictive of outcome for this patient pool, both in local control (change in contrast-enhancing volume) and global outcome (time to further treatment and survival). This modality may have an important role in improving the selection, planning, and treatment process for glioma patients	
4562	Patient position verification using small IMRT fields	Anatomy, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Methods, Movement, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Universities	A commonly used approach to quantify and minimize patient setup errors is by using electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs). The position of the tumor can be verified indirectly by matching the bony anatomy to a reference image containing the same structures. In this paper we present two off-line methods for detecting the position of the bony anatomy automatically, even if every single portal image of each segment of an IMRT treatment beam contains insufficient matching information. Extra position verification fields will no longer be necessary, which reduces the total dose to the patient. The first method, the stack matching method (SMM), stacks the portal image of each segment of a beam to a three dimensional (3D) volume, and this volume is subsequently used during the matching phase. The second method [the averaged projection matching method (APMM)], is a simplification of the first one, since the initially created volume is reduced again to a 2D artificial image, which speeds up the matching procedure considerably, without a significant loss of accuracy. Matching is based on normalized mutual information. We demonstrate our methods by comparing them to existing matching routines, such as matching based on the largest segment. Both phantom and patient experiments show that our methods are comparable with the results obtained from standard position verification methods. The matches are verified by means of visual inspection. Furthermore, we show that when a distinct area of 40-60 cm2 of the EPID is exposed during one treatment beam, both SMM and APMM are able to deliver a good matching result	
3156	Significance of initial "performance status" in patients receiving halfbody radiation	Female, Humans, Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Palliative Care/mt [Methods], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Survival, Time	The excellent palliative value of halfbody radiation is well documented. The optimum time to use this modality for palliation of symptoms is unclear. Our department treated 44 evaluable patients with upper and lower halfbody radiation. Stratification according to a modified Karnofsky performance scale revealed an 86% response with a notable increase in median duration of survival in those patients exhibiting an initial performance scale of -1. The optimum benefit from halfbody irradiation is derived when administered at the earliest indicated time

In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a "damage ratio" (DR) and a "recovery ratio" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment	
2245	Young Investigator Award presentation at the 13th Annual Meeting of the ESMRMB, September 1996, Prague. A proton-electron double-resonance imaging apparatus with simultaneous multiple electron paramagnetic resonance irradiation at 10 mT	Awards and Prizes, Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy/is [Instrumentation], Europe, Free Radicals, Free Radicals/me [Metabolism], Free Radicals/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Inflammation, Kidney, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/is [Instrumentation], Nitrogen, Nitrogen Oxides, Nitrogen Oxides/me [Metabolism], Nitrogen Oxides/re [Radiation Effects], Physics, Research, Societies,Scientific, Universities	The detection of free radicals in vivo is very important for the study of many physiologic and pathologic conditions. Free radicals have been implicated in a number of diseases such as ischemia, inflammation, kidney damage, and cancer. Proton-electron double-resonance imaging (PEDRI) allows the indirect detection of free radicals via the Overhauser effect. Nitroxide free radicals used for in vivo PEDRI studies present spectra with two or three lines, but most PEDRI experiments performed to date have used only single-line electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) irradiation. There is theoretical evidence that simultaneous irradiation of multiple EPR transitions could increase the maximum achievable PEDRI enhancement. From the experimental point of view, this requires the combined use of a suitable multiple-frequency EPR source and a multiple-tuned EPR resonator. A novel radiofrequency (RF) triple-tuned loop-gap resonator for use in PEDRI has recently been developed, and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) data were reported. In the present study we describe a new PEDRI apparatus, equipped with a triple-tuned resonator, that is suitable for simultaneous double- or triple-EPR irradiation of nitroxide free radicals. In particular, the details of the EPR hardware used to generate the two or three EPR frequencies are given, and PEDRI images obtained with simultaneous multiple EPR irradiation are shown. Moreover, DNP experimental results showing the increase of the enhancement as a function of the EPR power for single and simultaneous double EPR irradiation are presented. The main goal of this apparatus is to improve the sensitivity and/or to reduce EPR irradiation power in a PEDRI experiment. This is likely to be particularly important in future biologic applications of PEDRI where the applied power must be optimized to reduce sample heating

Focussed accelerated helium ion beams derived from charged-particle cyclotrons are stereotactically directed into the brain to obliterate abnormal shunts. Treated patients demonstrate delayed changes in brain anatomy and function that occur months to years after radiosurgery. The underlying mechanisms of the brain's delayed reaction to charged-particle radiosurgery involve complex perturbations in cerebrovascular and metabolic function. This report describes the wide range of delayed reactions that may occur in the brain after radiosurgery, including hemodynamic changes, blood-brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema, metabolic suppression, and parenchymal necrosis. These delayed reactions to injury in the brain involve potential target cells that include cerebral endothelial cells, oligodendroglia and astrocytes	
3551	The dosimetric properties of an applicator system for intraoperative electron-beam therapy utilizing a Clinac-18 accelerator	Electrons, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Time	A prototype electron applicator system providing circular and rectangular fields for use in intraoperative electron beam therapy with a Varian Clinac 18 linear accelerator has been fabricated. The dosimetric properties of this system for a variety of electron-beam energies, applicator sizes, and x-ray collimator settings was documented. Significant findings include: (a) surface dose values are in excess of 90% for electron energies of 12 MeV and above; (b) for the 18-MeV beam, the deepest depth where the central axis dose in 90% of its maximum value is in excess of 50 mm for circular applicators whose diameters are in excess of 5 cm; and (c) the treatment time to deliver 1000 rads "given dose" (at given dose rate of 300 MU/min) is on the order of 3-4 min. Cross-field behavior is acceptable for the intended application and x-ray contamination is less than 4% for any applicator/electron energy combination. A system for irregular field blocking and TLD verification dosimetry has been developed

Iodine contrast agents (CA), used during computed tomography (CT) imaging, lead to an increase of the Hounsfield units in tissue with increased CA uptake and cause errors in the calculation of the ranges. The aim of this work is to quantify how accurately ion range is calculated in CA loaded tissue. In order to quantify the mean change in Hounsfield units (HU), a statistical analysis of 25 CT data sets with and without CA was performed. To establish a relation between the change in Hounsfield units due to CA and changes in ion range, the Hounsfield number for various CA concentrations and the range of ions in CA was measured. The analysis of CT data sets showed that after intravenous injection of 100 ml contrast agent (Imeron300) at a concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml an increase of the Hounsfield numbers in tumor tissue of up to 57 HU can be observed. The measured range shift in CA is much smaller than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The maximum error in range resulting from the CA enhanced data is approximately 2.5% and results mainly from this wrong interpretation of HU by the TPS. For a tumor with an extent of 5 cm this leads to an exaggeration of the ion ranges during irradiation of (1.24+/-0.04) mm. This may be clinically relevant in cases where highest precision is needed and where organs at risk are close to the target volume. In view of these findings it may be safer to rely solely on native CT data for the purpose of dose and range optimization in therapy planning for heavy ions and protons	
3576	Cancer of the breast. Radiation therapy. [Review] [28 refs]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Energy Transfer, Female, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Mastectomy, Mediastinum, Neoplasms,Multiple Primary/et [Etiology], Palliative Care, Pneumonia/et [Etiology], Pulmonary Fibrosis/et [Etiology], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Risk, Survival, Thorax, Time Factors	There are many questions that have to be answered concerning the role of radiotherapy in the management of primary breast cancer. Hopefully, prospective clinical trials will provide some answers, but more basic research into the biology of breast cancer and the host-tumor relationship will be needed. There are indications that radiotherapy alone, or following minimal extirpative surgery in selected cases, may be as effective for control of breast cancer as conventional mastectomies. The role of radiotherapy following segmental mastectomy, with or without axillary dissection, needs to be clarified. The possibility exists that high LET (linear energy transfer) radiation such as neutron or pi meson beams may provide better local control than conventional radiation. Thus, it may be possible to treat effectively all primary breast cancers with such radiations and obviate the need for any type of mastectomy. It remains to be demonstrated whether adjuvant chemotherapy is as effective as radiotherapy in preventing chest wall and regional node recurrences. If it is not, there may be a place for both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of operable cancer of the breast. Likewise, effective chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy may increase the local and regional control achieved with radiotherapy alone and make more primary lesions suitable for treatment without mastectomy. Meyer (1970) recently called attention to the leukopenia and cellualr immune deficiency produced by irradiation to the thorax and mediastinum. Further study is necessary to define exactly how much immunosuppression results from radiotherapy, its clinical significance and what can be done to avoid or counter it. If Stjervsward's thesis (1974) concerning the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on survival is correct, then it is of great importance to identify those patients most likely to be adversely affected by radiotherapy. Conversely, it may be possible in the future to identify a subgroup of patients who would not be adversely affected by radiation and who would be most likely to benefit from it. [References: 28]

Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

[German]	Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Energy Transfer, Hand, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skin, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Surgery is without question the treatment of choice for the malignant melanoma (MM) of the skin. Radiotherapy, on the other hand, has been more and more neglected, especially because of the opinion that melanomas are "radioresistant". Because there is an increasing interest in the radiotherapy of MM in the recent years, and reviewing the experimental and clinical findings in the literature the following points are made: MM is not a "radioresistant" tumour and therefore the expression reduced radiosensitivity should be used instead; radiotherapy with beams of low linear energy transfer (LET) is also possible if the techniques involve the use of high dose per fraction or multiple fractions per day; different types of MM of the skin show a variable radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo; and indications still exist for the radiotherapy of MM. All possibilities for the use of radiotherapy alone in MM have not yet been exhausted

It is based on simulation of lung cancer radiation risk for different types of radiation. Specific radiation risk models developed according to the results of direct epidemiological studies are used for the simulation. These include two published risk models for uranium miners and nuclear workers of the Mayak facilities in the former Soviet Union. Additionally two lung cancer risk models are developed and described for the following cases: population indoor radon exposure and low-linear-energy-transfer reference radiation exposure. By the results of lifetime lung cancer risk simulation the RBE values range from 11 to 12 and from 1.7 to 4.9 for the cases of plutonium incorporation and of radon progeny exposure accordingly. The significant uncertainty of radiation risk models results in significant variation of RBE assessments. Rough estimations of RBE values 90% confidence interval are from unit fraction to 25 and from 2 to 50 for the cases of radon progeny exposure and plutonium incorporation accordingly	
4456	An intracavitary cone system for electron beam therapy using a Therac 20 linear accelerator	Humans, Lead, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	The Therac 20 is an AECL medical linear accelerator that produces electron and photon beams. Electron fields are produced by a scanned beam; collimation is provided by two sets of primary collimators and further collimated by external electron trimmers located 11 cm above the plane of isocenter (100 cm). These collimators are not suitable for intracavitary treatment. To overcome this limitation, we have designed an intracavitary cone system that attaches to the electron trimmers. Since the trimmers do not have to be removed while this system is in use, there is no need to bypass the associated interlock system. The apparatus consists of a platform which slides onto the lower set of trimmers, onto which a lead insert is attached. Dosimetry measurements for 9, 13, and 17 MeV electron beams are reported for three different treatment cones

Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations of the specific energy absorption rate (SAR) have been performed on this model with a 2 mm resolution for a generic mobile communication transceiver represented by a quarter-wavelength monopole on a metal box. The antenna was mounted either at the centre or corner of the top face of the box. The frequencies considered were 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz. Three irradiation geometries were considered, a vertical handset in front of the eye and vertical and horizontal orientations at the side of the ear. The effect of a hand grasping the handset was considered. The head model was scaled to represent the head of an infant and a subset of calculations was performed to verify that the SAR deposited in the infant head did not exceed that in the adult. Results are also presented for a half-wavelength dipole. The maximum SAR values produced by the generic transceiver for the horizontal orientation at the side of the head which is the most typical position, averaged over 10 g of tissue at 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz, are 2.1 and 3.0 W kg(-1) per W of radiated power. The corresponding values over 1 g of tissue are 2.3 and 4.8 W kg(-1) per W at 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz. However, if one were to consider all possible operational conditions, the placement of the transceiver in front of the eye will give 3.1 and 4.6 W kg(-1) per W averaged over 10 g of tissue and 4.7 and 7.7 W kg(-1) per W over 1 g of tissue at 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz, respectively

The growth of carbon-irradiated cells started to slow down considerably sooner than that of non-irradiated cells before reaching senescence. In contrast, cells irradiated with gamma-rays under similar conditions did not show significant deviation from the non-irradiated cells. A DNA double strand break (DSB) marker, gamma-H2AX foci, and a DSB repair marker, phosphorylated DNA-PKcs foci, increased in number when non-irradiated cells reached several passages before senescence. A single low dose/low dose rate carbon ion exposure further raised the numbers of these markers. Furthermore, the numbers of foci for these two markers were significantly reduced after the cells became fully senescent. Our results indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation (carbon ions) causes different effects than low LET radiation (gamma-rays) even at very low doses and that a single low dose of heavy ion irradiation can affect the stability of the genome many generations after irradiation

We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors. However, simultaneous individual anesthetic challenges require pediatric anesthesiologists highly experienced with the pediatric airway, clinical alertness and closed monitoring

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

[French]	Algorithms, Equipment Design, Feasibility Studies, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	In external radiotherapy, the use of intensity modulated fields has been proposed for tissue and non-homogeneity compensation or for the generation of conformal dose distributions. Multileaf collimators can be employed dynamically for the modulation of the X-ray field in two dimensions. Efficient dynamic collimation became possible due to advances in computer and linear accelerator technology. It presents a number of advantages over conventional methods such as the use of compensators. We have developed a program which calculates, from a given intensity distribution, the motion of the MLC leaves as a function of monitor units, and we have applied it on a Varian linear accelerator with a 40 pair multileaf collimator. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the feasibility and the potential of the method

The Clinac-600SR has a single 6-MV beam with the same beam characteristics as that of the mother unit, the Clinac-600C. The primary collimator is a fixed cone projecting to a 10-cm diameter at isocenter. The secondary collimator is a heavily shielded cylindrical collimator attached to the face plate of the primary collimator. The tertiary collimation consists of the actual treatment cones. The cone sizes vary from 12.5 to 40.0 mm diameter. The mechanical stability of the entire system was verified. The variations in isocenter position with table, gantry, and collimator rotation were found to be < 0.5 mm with a compounded accuracy of < or = 1.0 mm. The radiation leakage under the cones was < 1% measured at a depth of 5 cm in a phantom. The beam profiles of all cones in the x and y directions were within +/- 0.5 mm and match with the physical size of the cone. The dosimetric data such as tissue maximum ratio, off-axis ratio, and cone factor were taken using film, diamond detector, and ion chambers. The mechanical and dosimetric characteristics including dose linearity of this unit are presented and found to be suitable for SRS/SRT. The difficulty in absolute dose measurement for small cone is discussed

Human mammary epithelial cells of the immortal, non-tumorigenic cell line H184B5 F5-1 M/10 were irradiated and surviving clones isolated and expanded in culture. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using dedicated software with an image analyzer. We have found that both high- and low-LET radiation induced chromosomal instability in long-term cultures, but with different characteristics. Complex chromosomal rearrangements were observed after X-rays, while chromosome loss predominated after alpha-particles. Deletions were observed in both cases. In clones derived from cells exposed to alpha-particles, some cells showed extensive chromosome breaking and double minutes. Genomic instability was correlated to delayed reproductive death and neoplastic transformation. These results indicate that chromosomal instability is a radiation-quality-dependent effect which could determine late genetic effects, and should therefore be carefully considered in the evaluation of risk for space missions

Metaphase chromosomes 1 and 2 were painted using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) whole chromosome probes. All unstable and stable aberrations involving the painted chromosomes were scored. The whole genome corrected alpha-coefficient for dicentrics was 0.244 +/- 0.023 and for total translocations 0.346 +/- 0.032, when considering simple and complex exchanges. The ratio of bicoloured total translocations to bicoloured dicentrics was 1.21 +/- 0.15 and the ratio of 2-way to 1-way translocations was 1.73 +/- 0.27 for apparently simple exchanges only. A correlation was noted between the distributions of dicentrics and translocations and this applied even when the complex rearrangements were removed. 20% of the observed rearrangements were complex and this observation was independent of dose. Qualitatively, following irradiation with alpha-particles the complex rearrangements observed were of a greater complexity than seen after X- or gamma-rays. Using the Savage and Simpson system to classify the complex rearrangements, the higher order complexes were found to be the most common type observed. However the insertion type increased while the 2F + 2G types decreased when complex rearrangements induced by alpha-particles were compared to those formed after X- or gamma-irradiation	
1642	The rush to judgment: Does the evidence support the enthusiasm over three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and dose escalation in the treatment of prostate cancer?.[see comment].

METHODS: We first define 3D-CRT in comparison to standard radiation therapy and discuss the assumptions on which the technology of 3D-CRT and dose escalation are based. We then examine the evidence on the benefits and limitations from the current most commonly cited studies on dose-escalation trials to treat prostate cancer. RESULTS: The assumption that 3D-CRT can provide a tighter margin around the tumor area to allow for dose escalation is not yet proven by studies that show continual difficulty in defining the planning treatment volume because of extrinsic and intrinsic difficulties, such as imaging variabilities and patient and organ movement. Current short-term dose-escalation studies on the use of 3D-CRT to treat prostate cancer are limited in their ability to prove that increasing dose improves survival and does not incur potential long-term complications to normal tissue. CONCLUSION: Although 3D-CRT is a promising technology that many radiation oncologists and clinics are quickly adopting to treat such tumors as prostate cancer, the long-term evidence on the benefits and limitations of this technology is still lacking. Until we have solid long-term evidence on the true clinical potential of this new technology, let us not rush to judgment, but exercise caution, diligence, and thoughtfulness in using this new technology to treat our patients.

166	W values and radial dose distributions for protons in TE-gas and air at energies up to 500 MeV	Air, Electrons, Gases, Germany, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reproducibility of Results	The dosimetry of charged-particle beams is frequently performed by measuring the ionization yield produced in gas-filled ionization chambers and converting it into absorbed dose using the mean energy W expended in a gas per ion pair formed, or its differential value omega for the filling gas. Because of the increasing importance of proton therapy and the lack of accurate values of W and omega at high proton energies in particular, we investigated the ionization yield formation by protons in air and methane-based tissue-equivalent gas in the energy range up to 500 MeV. For this purpose, we analysed the available experimental values of W and omega and, in a second step, investigated the ionization-yield formation by protons as a function of their initial energy using an analytical method based on the Spencer-Fano equation in the framework of the continuous-slowing-down approximation. To estimate possible ionization losses which can be expected if the ionometric method is applied in the case of an incomplete secondary-electron equilibrium, a new analytical model has been developed which can be used to calculate the radial distribution of the ionization yield produced by secondary electrons around high-energy proton tracks

This paper presents the results obtained using MD-55 film for the verification of real radiotherapy treatments through proton beam irradiation of suitable phantoms at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) in Bebington (UK). After exposure, the variation in optical density of the films was measured using a CCD100 Microdensitometer (source at 665 nm). Holes of calibrated diameter, made during the assembly phase of the phantom, are identified by the MIRA software, used for data analysis, and allow the rendering of the films. The surface dose distributions were obtained from the variation in optical density of each of the films making up the phantom. Their elaboration to duplicate their position within the phantom, performed by 3D-doctor software, allows the volumetric reconstruction of the dose distribution

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In primary breast cancer, it is estimated that about 300 of the annually 3 425 irradiated patients can potentially be candidates for proton beam therapy to reduce late toxicity, mainly from the heart and lungs.

The basic technique comprises three sets of opposing beams (laterals and +/- 45 degrees with respect to the lateral) into a 6-field arrangement. Target volumes together with bladder and rectal wall volumes are outlined on axial CT slices and combined to form 3-D volumes. For each field, an interactive BEV display is produced showing the target volume in its correct 3-D geometrical perspective and an auto-block routine is used to design focused blocks which conform to that volume. Full 3-D volume calculations computed for those plans on 17 patients were analyzed along with similar calculations for more traditional unblocked 4-field box and bilateral arc techniques. Compared to the 95% isodose volume for the 6-field conformational technique, traditional open beam full target coverage techniques typically produce high dose volumes which cover up to five times as much uninvolved tissue. Dose volume histograms illustrate that typically half as much bladder and rectal tissue is treated to high dose using the conformational boost techniques. From the dosimetric perspective of sparing normal tissues, shaped fixed-field boost techniques are shown to be clearly superior to traditional full coverage bilateral arc techniques. Smaller 8 cm X 8 cm arc techniques are shown to be quantitatively unacceptable for treatment of this advanced stage disease, as they typically misses 20-35% of the target volume

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

The measured physical dose-biological effect relationships allow the safe and effective delivery of therapeutic schedules of heavy ions. Among the charged particle beams available, carbon, neon and helium ions in the "extended Bragg peak mode" have optimal physical and biological effectiveness for delivery of therapy to deep seated tumors. The depth-dose profiles of these beams protect intervening and adjacent tissues as well as tissues beyond the range of the particles. For the treatment of hypoxic tumors, silicon and argon beams are being considered because they significantly depress the radiobiological oxygen effect in the region of the extended Bragg ionization peak. The depth-effectiveness of the argon beam is somewhat limited, however, because of primary particle fragmentation. Silicon beams have a depth-dose profile which is intermediate between that of neon and argon, and are candidates to become the particle of choice for maximizing high LET particle effects. Heavy accelerated ions depress enzymatic repair mechanisms, decrease variations of radiosensitivity during the cell division cycle, cause greater than expected delays in cell division, and decrease the protective effects of neighboring cells in organized systems. Near the Bragg peak, enhancement of heavy particle effects are observed in split dose schedules. Late and carcinogenic effects are being studied. With the newly developed Repair-Misrepair theory we can quantitatively model most observations. [References: 34]

Radiation doses typically received by patients from diagnostic X-ray studies, including mammography and computerized axial tomography, are presented. Modern-day radiation therapy, both with conventional photons and with electrons and high-LET particles, emphasizes the need for accurate dosimetry. The different methods of beam calibration and dosimetry intercomparisons for the variety of radiation beams are discussed. Results of several important dosimetry intercomparisons are also presented.

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity

We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94%. One patient (2.2%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg	
2681	Errors in three-dimensional doses calculated from a two-dimensional database--case report: wedged fields at 6 MV	Algorithms, Biophysics, Databases,Factual, Humans, Lead, London, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy	This report discusses the calculation of x-ray doses in three dimensions using a treatment planning database which was measured in two dimensions only. It concerns the common assumption that wedged field profiles in the non-wedged direction are similar to open-field profiles for the same field size and depth. It shows the extent to which this assumption can lead to errors in wedge dose calculation for both solid and dynamically wedged fields on Varian linear accelerators at 6 MV. Finally it shows that this assumption tends to produce more accurate results when used to calculate doses for dynamically wedged fields and why, even in the wedged direction, some of the simpler treatment planning algorithms are more suitable for dynamic wedges than they are for solid wedges

IMRT is an innovative technique in which the high-dose radiation volume conforms to an accurately defined target volume with less morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues. The main medical objectives of the projects are (1) to improve the therapeutic index while decreasing acute toxicity and late sequelae (mainly xerostomia and acute mucite for head and neck tumors), which allows an increase in the radiation dose to the tumor and then a better tumor control; (2) to propose a salvage treatment to patients who locally recurred in previously irradiated sites; (3) to determine the optimal treatment guidelines for a safe use of the technique in clinical routine. Our projects also aim at comparing IMRT and 3D conformal treatments on the one hand (STIC 2001), and IMRT and conventional treatments on the other hand (STIC 2002), with regard to costs. As a matter of fact, the use of IMRT is presently limited in France because its implementation requires high investment and personnel costs. The seventeen French Regional Cancer Centres involved in the two projects intend to study the additional cost of the use IMRT in comparison with the use of standard techniques, which appears to be a step for a wide use of this technique in France. Each of the studies is two-year prospective, and includes patients with head and neck tumors treated with a curative intend (post operative or exclusive treatments for STIC 2002 and STIC 2002), and patients with a prostate cancer (STIC 2001)

Symptomatic epilepsy was present in 29 patients (22.5%) before the treatment. It was markedly relieved by the radiosurgery leading to cessation of the seizures in 16 patients, the persisting seizure-free follow-up period ranging from 2 to 8 years (mean 4.5 years). In no case was the epilepsy worsened by radiosurgery. The positive effect on epilepsy was not strictly dependent on the angiographic result, suggesting that the ionizing radiation by itself could lead to inhibition of epileptic activity around the AVM

[Review] [77 refs]	Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], California, Dose Fractionation, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioma/su [Surgery], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research	Gliomas are infiltrative lesions that typically have poorly defined margins on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images. This presents a considerable challenge for planning radiation and other forms of focal therapy, and introduces the possibility of both under-treating macroscopic tumor, and over-treating regions of normal brain tissue. New therapy systems are able to deliver radiation more precisely and accurately to irregular three-dimensional target volumes, and have placed a premium on definition of the spatial extent of the lesion. Proton MR spectroscopic imaging (H-MRSI) has been proposed as an in vivo molecular imaging technique that assists in targeting and predicts response to radiation therapy for patients with gliomas. The evidence that supports the use of H-MRSI for planning radiation treatment is reviewed, together with the technical requirements for implementing data acquisition and analysis procedures in a clinical setting. Although there is room for improvement in the spatial resolution and chemical specificity obtained at the conventional field strength of 1.5 T, there are clear benefits to integrating H-MRSI into treatment planning and follow-up examinations. Further work is required to integrate the results of the H-MRSI examination into the treatment planning workstation, and to improve the quality of the data using more sensitive phased array coils and higher field strength magnets.

Unlike wedge factors for physical wedges that depend on wedge material and thickness, wedge factors for Varian dynamic wedges depend on the relationship between the position of the moving jaw and the number of delivered monitor units. In this study, we describe a new analytical model for dynamic wedge factors. We also review the existing analytical models and compare calculated and measured wedge factors. The comparison is performed for different wedge angles, symmetric and asymmetric fields and two different photon energies. The obtained results indicate that the new dynamic wedge model provides the best overall agreement (within 1%) with the measured wedge factors

The accuracy necessary to perform this procedure requires an intensive quality assurance program to encompass all aspects of dose calibration and mechanical integrity of the treatment unit, the treatment planning process, and treatment delivery. The programs developed at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT) include testing of the linear accelerator and the stereotactic system, cross checking of the treatment planning process, and a quality assurance check list of the treatment delivery procedure. This report outlines in detail the quality assurance program currently in use at the JCRT

METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 32 patients underwent surgical resection for suspected progression of brain metastases from a cohort of 245 patients with brain metastases treated with GKR. Postradiosurgery MRI surveillance was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after GKR. In some cases, additional MRI scanning with spectroscopy or perfusion (MRS/P) was used to aid differentiation of radiation change from tumor progression. The decision to perform neurosurgical resection was based on MRI or clinical evidence of lesion progression among patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more and absent or stable systemic disease. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (32 out of 245) of patients and 6% (38 out of 611) of lesions required surgical resection after GKR. The median time from GKR to surgical resection was 8.6 months (range, 1.7-27.1 mo). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival from time of GKR was 97, 78, and 47% for the resected patients and 65, 40, and 19% for the nonresected patients (P < 0.0001). The two-year survival rate of patients requiring two resections after GKR was 100% compared with 39% for patients undergoing one resection (P = 0.02). The median survival of resected patients was 27.2 months (range, 7.0-72.5 mo) from the diagnosis of brain metastases, 19.9 months (range, 5.0-60.7 mo) from GKR, and 8.9 months (range, 0.2-53.1 mo) from surgical resection. Tumor was found in 90% of resected specimens and necrosis alone in 10%. MRS/P studies were performed in 15 resected patients. Overall, MRS/P predicted tumor in 11 lesions, confirmed pathologically in nine lesions, and necrosis alone was found in two. The MRS/P predicted necrosis alone in three, whereas pathology revealed viable tumor in two and necrosis in one lesion. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of progressive brain metastases after GKR in selected patients leads to a meaningful improvement in survival rates. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MRS/P in the postradiosurgery surveillance of brain metastases

It was found that the plating efficiency and proliferation of the unirradiated recipient cells were increased and that these increases were related to the LET as well as the radiation dose. Exposure of HSGc cells to higher LET and higher dose was much more effective in enhancing the plating efficiency and proliferation of the unirradiated cells than exposure to lower LET and lower dose. However, when PTIO, a nitric oxide (NO)-specific scavenger, was present in the co-culture medium, the cell growth capacity of the unirradiated recipients was reduced to control level, indicating that NO is involved in the bystander response. As an oxidation product of NO, nitrite was detected in the co-culture medium and its concentration depended on the LET and dose of irradiation. Using a NO-generator sper/NO, it was verified that NO at low concentrations indeed enhanced cell proliferation. Accordingly, NO plays an important role in medium-mediated bystander effects

The authors' findings evidence that postradiation changes in the anterior segment of the eye, resulting from radiation iridocyclitis, are mainly responsible for the development of secondary glaucoma. Preliminary laser-effected formation of iridal coloboma is conducive to a normal flow in the anterior chamber at the expense of an additional pupil functioning and thus helps reduce the possibility of secondary glaucoma development by 1.6 times (or by 38.5%)

To reduce the uncertainties caused by this motion, we have developed feedback-guided breath hold (FGBH), a novel delivery technique in which radiation is delivered only during a voluntary breath hold that is sustained for as long as the patient feels comfortable. Here we present the technical aspects of FGBH, which involve (1) fabricating the hardware so the respiratory trace can be displayed to the patient, (2) assembling a delay box to be used as a breath-hold detector, and (3) performing quality control tests to ensure that FGBH can be delivered accurately and safely. A commercial respiratory tracking system that uses an external fiducial to monitor abdominal wall motion generates and displays the breathing trace and specific positions in the breathing cycle where a breath hold needs to occur. Hardware was developed to present this display to the patient in the treatment position. Patients view the presentation either on a liquid crystal display or through a pair of virtual reality goggles. Using the respiratory trace as a visual aid, the patient performs a breath hold so that the position representing the location of a fiducial is held within a specified gating window. A delay box was fabricated to differentiate between gating signals received during free breathing and those received during breath hold, allowing radiation delivery only when the fiducial was within the breath-hold gating window. A quality control analysis of the gating delay box and the integrated system was performed to ensure that all of the hardware and components were ready for clinical use

The introduction of an active beam shaping system for carbon ions has considerable impact on the design of the treatment planning system (TPS). The TPS has to account for the capability of the beam delivery and the biological modelling, which is needed to calculate the RBE for the resulting varying depth dose modulation. The TPS used in clinical routine with carbon ions is described and its use in treatment planning studies are outlined. A clinical trial with carbon ion therapy as primary therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull has been completed in 2001. Currently, carbon ion therapy as a boost treatment together with conventional conformal photon therapy or IMRT is under investigation in clinical trials for adenoid cystic carcinoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the cervical spine and sacrococcygeal chordoma. Treatment planning studies comparing carbon ion therapy with IMRT, using optimization of combination therapy, and optimization of beam-line design have already been completed. Analysis of uncertainties in treatment planning has been started with the investigation of range uncertainties stemming from CT imaging. Uncertainties coming from the beam delivery play only a minor role. An attempt to asses the uncertainties introduced in treatment plans by the biological modelling, was done, using phantom verification of calculated cell survival levels. The clinical trials and planning studies are of special importance for the upcoming new clinical ion facility of the Heidelberg university hospital	
1901	Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) calculations as a means to compare proton and photon plans and evaluation of clinical appropriateness of calculated values	Child, Cranial Irradiation, Germany, Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Necrosis, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Probability, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Universities	Calculation of normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for proton radiation therapy (PRT) and two photon radiation therapy techniques for cranial irradiation of childhood optic nerve gliomas was made. Evaluation of usefulness of calculated NTCP values for comparison of treatment plans and clinical appropriateness of computed data was used. Three radiation plans were calculated on datasets of children treated previously for optic nerve gliomas with PRT. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and used to calculate NTCP. Evaluated complication endpoints were necrosis, blindness, and cognitive impairment. Calculated NTCP depended strongly on tumor volume and the normal tissue volume exposed to high radiation doses. Dose conformity and steeper dose-gradient correlated with reduced NTCP. Regarding the chosen complication endpoints, PRT was superior to 3D photons; conventional photons were calculated to have the highest NTCPs. Differences might reach clinical significance for cognitive impairment, a frequently observed toxicity. Calculated NTCP values were highly dependent on implemented clinical data. Calculation of NTCP can be used for ranking of treatment plans and modalities. Highly dependent on implemented clinical data, the calculated percentage of NTCP might be more of a figure of merit than a real predictive value and requires comparison to clinical experience. Int.

The practicality and efficacy of TAT is tested by in vitro and in vivo studies in melanoma, leukaemia, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers, and by a phase 1 trial of intralesional TAT for melanoma. The alpha-emitting radioisotope used is Bi-213, which is eluted from the Ac-225 generator and chelated to a cancer specific monoclonal antibody (mab) or protein (e.g. plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 PAI2) to form the alpha-conjugate (AC). Stable alpha-ACs have been produced which have been tested for specificity and cytotoxicity in vitro against melanoma (9.2.27 mab), leukaemia (WM60), colorectal (C30.6), breast (PAI2, herceptin), ovarian (PAI2, herceptin, C595), prostate (PAI2, J591) and pancreatic (PAI2, C595) cancers. Subcutaneous inoculation of 1-1.5 million human cancer cells into the flanks of nude mice causes tumours to grow in all mice. Tumour growth is compared for untreated controls, nonspecific AC and specific AC, for local (subcutaneous) and systemic (tail vein or intraperitoneal) injection models. The 213Bi-9.2.27 AC is injected into secondary skin melanomas in stage 4 patients in a dose escalation study to determine the effective tolerance dose, and to measure kinematics to obtain the equivalent dose to organs. In vitro studies show that TAT is one to two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic to targeted cells than non-specific ACs, specific beta emitting conjugates or free isotopes. In vivo local TAT at 2 days post-inoculation completely prevents tumour formation for all cancers tested so far. Intra-lesional TAT can completely regress advanced sc melanoma but is less successful for breast and prostate cancers. Systemic TAT inhibits the growth of sc melanoma xenografts and gives almost complete control of breast and prostate cancer tumour growth. Intralesional doses up to 450 microCi in human patients are effective in regressing melanomas, with no concomitant complications. These results point to the application of local and systemic TAT in the management of secondary cancer. Results of the phase 1 clinical trial of TAT of subcutaneous, secondary melanoma indicate proof of the principle that TAT can make tumours in patients regress

[German]	Anaerobiosis, Fast Neutrons, Germany,East, Humans, Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Oxygen Consumption, Radiation, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	In 1972 GDR started with the treatment of tumor patients with fast neutrons on the base of oxygen-effect. That means a better sensitivity of radiation of anoxic cells against radiation with high LET in comparison to radiation of thin ionization. Every tumor contains some anoxic cells. Therefore a better effect is possible with doses that are tolerated by normal tissue. In the following the details of the problems are discussed	
1992	An MCNP-based model of a linear accelerator x-ray beam	Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Head, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Physics, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiometry/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, X-Rays	The Monte Carlo N-Particle radiation transport computer code (MCNP) has been employed on a personal computer to develop a simple model simulating the major components within the beam path of a linear accelerator radiation head, namely the electron target, primary conical collimator, beam flattening filter, wedge filter and the secondary collimators. The model was initially used to calculate the energy spectra and angular distributions of the x-ray beam for the Philips SL 75/5 linear accelerator, in a plane immediately beneath the flattening filter. These data were subsequently used as a 'source' of x-rays at the target position, to assess the emergent beam from the secondary collimators. The depth dose distributions and dose profiles at constant depth for various field sizes have been calculated for a nominal operating potential of 4 MV and found to be within acceptable limits. It is concluded that the technique may be used to calculate the energy spectra of any linear accelerator upon specification of the component dimensions, materials and nominal accelerating potential. It is anticipated that this work will serve as the basis of a quality control tool for linear accelerators and treatment planning systems

146	Modification of a linear accelerator table top for non-coplanar conformal brain radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	The use of non-coplanar conformal therapy necessitates the use of unusual beam projections that may not be accomplished with a conventional linear accelerator table top. Modification of the table top can increase the available combinations of gantry and couch rotation. A standard Philips table top, supplied with an SL 75-5 linear accelerator, was modified to increase available combinations of gantry and couch rotation. This was accomplished by shortening the length and decreasing the width of the table top. The modified table top increases the combinations of gantry and couch angles significantly, simplifying the delivery of non-coplanar conformal therapy without significant compromise to routine treatment. The modification of a standard linear accelerator table top has increased the available combinations of gantry and couch rotation to accommodate non-coplanar conforrmal radiotherapy	
736	The influence of RBE variations in a clinical proton treatment plan for a hypopharynx cancer	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Linear Energy Transfer, Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Models,Biological, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Sweden	Currently, most clinical range-modulated proton beams are assumed to have a fixed overall relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. However, it is well known that the RBE increases with depth in the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and becomes about 10% higher than mid-SOBP RBE at 2 mm from the distal edge (Paganetti 2003 Technol. Cancer Res. Treat. 2 413-26) and can reach values of 1.3-1.4 in vitro at the distal edge (Robertson et al 1975 Cancer 35 1664-77, Courdi et al 1994 Br. J. Radiol. 67 800-4). We present a fast method for applying a variable RBE correction with linear energy transfer (LET) dependent tissue-specific parameters based on the alpharef/betaref ratios suitable for implementation in a treatment planning system. The influence of applying this variable RBE correction on a clinical multiple beam proton dose plan is presented here. The treatment plan is evaluated by RBE weighted dose volume histograms (DVHs) and the calculation of tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) values. The variable RBE correction yields DVHs for the clinical target volumes (CTVs), a primary advanced hypopharynx cancer and subclinical disease in the lymph nodes, that are slightly higher than those achieved by multiplying the absorbed dose with RBE=1.1. Although, more importantly, the RBE weighted DVH for an organ at risk, the spinal cord is considerably increased for the variable RBE. As the spinal cord in this particular case is located 8 mm behind the planning target volume (PTV) and hence receives only low total doses, the NTCP values are zero in spite of the significant increase in the RBE weighted DVHs for the variable RBE. However, high NTCP values for the non-target normal tissue were obtained when applying the variable RBE correction. As RBE variations tend to be smaller for in vivo systems, this study-based on in vitro data since human tissue RBE values are scarce and have large uncertainties-can be interpreted as showing the upper limits of the possible effects of utilizing a variable RBE correction. In conclusion, the results obtained here still indicate a significant difference in introducing a variable RBE compared to applying a generic RBE of 1.1, suggesting it is worth considering such a correction in clinical proton therapy planning, especially when risk organs are located immediately behind the target volume

Both therapy modes were used in the therapy of 62 patients with tumors of the kidneys, 13 patients with tumors of the esophagus, 20 patients with tumors of the prostate and urinary bladder and 170 patients with tumors of the breast. The advantage of the described method is the possibility of simple, precise and easily reproducible irradiation in given localizations, good therapeutic effect and very good general tolerance as the patient concerns	
799	Cell detection in phase-contrast images used for alpha-particle track-etch dosimetry: a semi-automated approach	Algorithms, Animals, Artificial Intelligence, Cell Count/mt [Methods], Cell Culture Techniques/mt [Methods], Cell Line,Tumor, Databases, Female, Humans, Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Linear Energy Transfer, Microscopy,Phase-Contrast/mt [Methods], Ovarian Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pattern Recognition,Automated/mt [Methods], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, Survival Rate, Time	A novel alpha-particle irradiator has recently been developed that provides the ability to characterize cell response. The irradiator is comprised of a collimated, planar alpha-particle source which, from below, irradiates cells cultured on a track-etch material. Cells are imaged using phase-contrast microscopy before and following irradiation to obtain geometric information and survival rates; these can be used with data from alpha-particle track images to assess cell response. A key step in this process is determining cell location within the pre-irradiation images. Although this can be done completely by a human observer, the number of images requiring analysis makes the process time-consuming and tedious. To reduce the potential human error and decrease user interaction time, a semi-automated, computer-aided method of cell detection has been developed. The method employs a two-level adaptive thresholding technique to obtain size and position information about potential cell cytoplasms and nuclei. Proximity and geometry-based thresholds are then used to mark structures as cells. False-positive detections from the automated algorithm are due mostly to imperfections in the track-etch background, camera effects and cellular residue. To correct for these, a human observer reviews all detected structures, discarding false positives. When analysing two randomly selected cell dish image databases, the semi-automated method detected 92-94% of all cells and 94-97% of cells with a well-defined cytoplasm and nucleus while reducing human workload by 32-83%	
2746	Chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by 8.7 MeV protons and 23.5 MeV helium-3 ions	Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Helium, Humans, Ions, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Radiation Genetics, Research	This paper describes the irradiation of thin samples of blood with 8.7 MeV protons and 23.5 MeV helium-3 ions in the track segment mode. Chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes have been scored. The relationship between dicentric yield and dose in Gy was Y = 0.044 D + 0.058 D2 for protons and Y = 0.394 D for helium ions. These results are compared with data from other laboratories using protons and an attempt is made to reconcile differences. An unexpected observation was that the ratio of the linear coefficients for helium ions and protons was about 9 whereas the ratio of the l.e.t. values was 4.5. This disagrees with current theory which predicts that the linear coefficients should be proportional to l.e.t. Possible sources of error in our experiments are discussed but do not adequately account for the discrepancies

The approach involves reducing an N-step dose-volume histogram for the tissue (obtained from the 3D treatment plan) to an equivalent (N-1)-step histogram; this procedure is repeated until there remains a single-step histogram, the complication probability of which can readily be determined. This note provides technical details concerning the histogram-reduction algorithm. Results obtained using it are compared with those for two alternative histogram-reduction algorithms

The simulations produced both the input data required by the TPS and the dose distributions to validate the analytical predictions from the TPS. An MC simulation of a typical ocular melanoma treatment was compared with the TPS predictions, revealing generally good agreement in the absorbed dose distribution. However, in the depth-dose profiles, differences >5% existed in the proximal region of all validation cases considered. Comparison of the radiation coverage at or above the 90% dose level, showed that MC calculated coverage was 82% and 68% of the coverage calculated by the TPS in two planes intersecting the tumour	
3661	Some factors affecting the sensitivity of cultured human cells to high-LET radiation	Animals, Canada, Cell Line, Cells,Cultured, Cells/re [Radiation Effects], DNA, DNA Repair, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Kidney/re [Radiation Effects], Ontario, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Survival, Water	Comparative effects of decay of DNA-bound 125I, of gamma-radiation and of tritiated water on survival of the proliferative ability of cultured cells were examined. The results confirm a previous report that cells frozen to -196 degrees C in the presence of 2M glycerol have lost a considerable proportion of their intracellular water. The data also suggest that the fraction of the lethal damage caused by deposition of radiation energy in intracellular water close to the DNA is greater for gamma-radiation than for the decay of DNA-bound 125I. Inherited differences in the sensitivity of untransformed fibroblasts from individual humans to ionizing radiations and other DNA-damaging agents are being explored. The ratios of the sensitivities of various cell lines to particular agents can vary several-fold. Thus the RBE of various radiations is affected not only by the irradiation conditions and the water content of the cells but also by inherited abnormalities in the DNA repair systems in human cells

To determine accurately the Larmor frequencies of water and fat protons within the vertebral bodies, a volume selective spectrum of a volume element (13 mm)3 located in a lumbar vertebral body was acquired with the 90 degrees-180 degrees-180 degrees double spin-echo method. These Larmor frequencies are used to adjust the frequency-selective pulse of the SENEX chemical-shift imaging sequence. This procedure provides well separated fat and water images for a large field of view even in the inhomogeneous region of the vertebral column. Their clinical importance is demonstrated by localized Larmor frequency-guided (LLFG) SENEX 1H images of the lumbar spine in healthy persons of different age and in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia

One innovative approach is the use of targeted alpha therapy (TAT) to inhibit cancer growth, using an alpha particle emitting radioisotope such as (213)Bi. Because of its short range and high linear energy transfer (LET), alpha-particles may be particularly effective in the treatment of cancer, especially in inhibiting the development of metastatic tumors from micro-metastases. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in prostate cancer cells and the neovasculature of a wide variety of malignant neoplasms including lung, colon, breast and others, but not in normal vascular endothelium. The expression is further increased in higher-grade cancers, metastatic disease and hormone-refractory prostate cancer (PCA). J591 is one of several monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to the extracellular domain of PSMA. Chelation of J591 mab with (213)Bi forms the alpha-radioimmunoconjugate (AIC). The objective of this preclinical study was to design an injectable AIC to treat human prostate tumors growing subcutaneously in mice. The anti-proliferative effects of AIC against prostate cancer were tested in vitro using the MTS assay and in vivo with the nude mice model. Apoptosis was documented using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT]-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate [dUTP] nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, while proliferative index was assessed using the Ki-67 marker. We show that a very high density of PSMA is expressed in an androgen-dependent human PCA cell line (LNCaP-LN3) and in tumor xenografts from nude mice. We also demonstrate that the AIC extensively inhibits the growth of LN3 cells in vitro in a concentration-dependent fashion, causing the cells to undergo apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that a local AIC injection of 50 microCi at 2 days post-cell inoculation gave complete inhibition of tumor growth, whereas results for a non-specific AIC were similar to those for untreated mice. Further, after 1 and 3 weeks post-tumor appearance, a single (100 microCi/100 microl) intra-lesional injection of AIC can inhibit the growth of LN3 tumor xenografts (volume<100 mm(3)) in nude mice. Tumors treated with AIC decreased in volume from a mean 46+/-14 mm(3) in the first week or 71+/-15 mm(3) in the third week to non-palpable, while in control mice treated with a non-specific AIC using the same dose, tumor volume increased from 42 to 590 mm(3). There were no observed side effects of the treatment. Because of its in vitro cytotoxicity and these anti-proliferative properties in vivo, the (213)Bi-J591 conjugate has considerable potential as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer	
1240	Dosimetric effect of respiration-gated beam on IMRT delivery	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Ions, Lead, Models,Statistical, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Respiration, Time, Time Factors	Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) requires synchronization of DMLC leaf motion with dose delivery. A delay in DMLC communication is known to cause leaf lag and lead to dosimetric errors. The errors may be exacerbated by gated operation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of leaf lag on the accuracy of doses delivered in gated IMRT. We first determined the effective leaf delay time by measuring the dose in a stationary phantom delivered by wedge-shaped fields. The wedge fields were generated by a DMLC at various dose rates. The so determined delay varied from 88.3 to 90.5 ms. The dosimetric effect of this delay on gated IMRT was studied by delivering wedge-shaped and clinical IMRT fields to moving and stationary phantoms at dose rates ranging from 100 to 600 MU/min, with and without gating. Respiratory motion was simulated by a linear sinusoidal motion of the phantom. An ionization chamber and films were employed for absolute dose and 2-D dose distribution measurements. Discrepancies between gated and nongated delivery to the stationary phantom were observed in both absolute dose and 2-D dose distribution measurements. These discrepancies increased monotonically with dose rate and frequency of beam interruptions, and could reach 3.7% of the total dose delivered to a 0.6 cm3 ion chamber. Isodose lines could be shifted by as much as 3 mm. The results are consistent with the explanation that beam hold-offs in gated delivery allowed the lagging leaves to catch up with the delivered monitor units each time that the beam was interrupted. Low dose rates, slow leaf speeds and low frequencies of beam interruptions reduce the effect of this delay-and-catch-up cycle. For gated IMRT it is therefore important to find a good balance between the conflicting requirements of rapid dose delivery and delivery accuracy

[Review] [46 refs]	Brain, Combined Modality Therapy, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Intraoperative Period, Neck, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Universities	The most efficacious treatment method for head and neck cancer is not yet defined. However, there have been some improvements made in the radiotherapy of head and neck cancer that are encouraging. Both hyperfractionated radiation therapy and accelerated radiation therapy have improved the local control rates in numerous primary sites, and the results of more rigorous prospective randomized studies, if positive, will justify more routine use of these techniques. The use of neutrons for unresectable salivary gland tumors has clearly been established as the treatment of choice. Local control as well as cosmetic outcome is excellent, with the only disadvantage being that neutron therapy is not as widely used as photon radiation. The same is true for charged particle therapy, the greatest utility of which appears to be for relatively small tumors adjacent to critical structures such as the brain and spinal cord. We also believe that intraoperative radiation therapy shows great promise and may soon be more widely available for the treatment of head and neck cancers. However, we believe that the most exciting advancement in the treatment of head and neck cancer is the use of concomitant radiation therapy and chemotherapy, a topic that is discussed in detail in another article in this issue.

4494	Parametrization of head-scatter factors for rectangular photon fields using an equivalent square formalism	Canada, Head, Humans, Jaw, Least-Squares Analysis, Mathematics, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research	Head-scatter factors of symmetric square and rectangular fields (field center on the central beam axis) defined by the upper (Y) and lower (X) jaws for 6 and 15 MV photon beams from 2300CD and 600C accelerators (Varian Associates, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) were measured, as well as those for fields shaped by the Y jaws and the multileaf collimator (MLC) of the 2300CD. For rectangular fields, the head-scatter factor for the field (x = a and y = b) was different from that for the field (y = a and x = b). This difference was 2% -3% for fields defined by conventional collimators when [formula, see text] was large, and became 4%-5% when the MLC and YT jaws were used to shape the fields with the X jaws retracted. In order to calculate values for head-scatter factors of rectangular fields accurately using an equivalent square formalism, the side of the equivalent square should be obtained with different weights for lower and upper jaws, as proposed by Vadash and Bjarngard [Med. Phys. 20, 733-734 (1993)]. Our measurements demonstrate that the relative weight (G) of upper and lower jaws is strongly dependent on their distances from the x-ray source, while the beam energy has little effect on the value of G. We further show that G can be calculated simply from these distances. An analytical representation for head-scatter factors of square and rectangular fields is also developed in this paper. The quality of this representation was judged by the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from measured head-scatter factors, which ranged from 0.11%-0.27%

Several MLC fields were designed, using the Varian C-series standard MLC-80, as reference fields for open fields. The MLC leaves were then shifted from the reference positions along the direction of MLC leaf movement towards the central axis from 0.1 to 1.6 mm. The electronic portal images (EPIs), acquired for each case, were converted to two-dimensional dose maps using an appropriate calibration method and the relative dose difference maps were then calculated. The experiment was then performed at non-zero gantry angles in the presence of an anthropomorphic phantom for typical prostate and head and neck fields. Several standard edge detection algorithms were also used in order to find the shifted MLC leaf position. In addition, the short-term reproducibility of MLC leaf positioning was evaluated using the above-mentioned methods. It was found that the relationship between the relative dose difference and MLC leaf spatial displacement is linear. A variation of 0.2 mm in leaf position leads to approximately 4% change in the relative dose values for open fields. The variation of the relative dose difference for phantom studies depends on the phantom positioning and the EPI normalization. From the standard edge detection algorithms, used in the current study, the 'Canny' algorithm was found to be the optimum method to identify the minimum detectable MLC leaf displacements with a precision of approximately 0.1 mm for all cases. However, the result of edge detection algorithms generally is binary and there is no additional information compared to the relative dose maps. The reproducibility of MLC positions was found to be within 0.3 mm. In conclusion, a SLIC-EPID can be used for regular quality assurance (QA) of MLC leaf positioning. Despite significant difference in the pixel size of the acquired SLIC-EPIs, it can be concluded that the SLIC-EPID can be used for MLC quality assurance protocols with similar accuracy compared to amorphous silicon (a-Si) EPID results

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were irradiated with low or high LET (20 - 2000 mGy). The gamma-H2AX foci were detected using immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis. RESULTS: The number of DSB determined 30 min post gamma-irradiation at 37 degrees C is 12.2 (+/-1.5), 13.5 (+/-1.6) and 19.1 (+/-1.7) foci/cell/Gy for V79-4, xrs-5 and HF19 cells respectively, comparable with levels detected in V79-4 cells using pulse field gel electrophoresis. 6 h post gamma-irradiation, gamma-H2AX foci levels in V79-4 and HF19 cells approach control levels but remain higher in DSB repair deficient xrs-5 cells. Gamma-H2AX foci levels remain significantly higher than controls at 6 h in a-irradiated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma-radiation and alpha-radiation induced the phosphorylation of H2AX in response to DSB at low doses; the variation in the rate of dephosphorylation of induced foci are dependent both on radiation quality and cell characteristics

Tandem and ovoids insertions were used and combinations of single and multiple applications along with high dose whole pelvic irradiation. Dosimetric analysis of treated cases for patterns of tissue dose were carried out. Tissue dose for Cf-NT was, in general, high for neutron components in the central pelvis only, and fell off rapidly with distance from the applicators. The majority and balance of therapeutic dose was contributed by low linear energy transfer (LET) high energy photon beam radiation to the whole pelvis. Comparison with fast neutron beam therapy (NBT) isodose curves showed that much more homogeneous neutron dose was delivered to the pelvic tumor and organs by NBT. Complication frequency has been reported to be higher for neutron beam therapy than for Cf-NT. It appears that the higher integral neutron biological dose to normal tissues for NBT compared to intracavitary Cf-NT probably contributed to the frequency of side effects	
3149	A double-junction technique for total central nervous system irradiation with a 4-MV accelerator	Brain, Central Nervous System Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Ependymoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lead, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Posture, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rest, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	An analysis is presented of a double-junction technique for the treatment of the complete central nervous system using orthogonal brain and spine ports from a 4-MV linear accelerator with a lead flattening filter. Experimental results are compared with calculated results in the junction zone. This study shows that clinically homogeneous doses (+/- 6%) can be delivered to the total central nervous system, provided that the irradiation of the junction zone is terminated about 10% sooner than irradiation of the rest of the brain and cord. The number of reduced fractions to be delivered in this region can be determined from the results of scatter dose calculations	
1814	Prognostic factors for carcinoma of the prostate. [Review] [47 refs]	Biopsy, Humans, Male, Probability, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostate, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Prostatic Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Regression Analysis, Reproducibility of Results, Risk Factors, Sample Size, Time, Tumor Markers,Biological, Uncertainty	Prognostic factors for prostatic carcinoma should be significant, independent and clinically important. They should be of practical use, and their determination should be affordable in everyday practice. Prognostic factors may be grouped into patient-related, tumor-related and treatment-related. They should meet certain requirements, such as possession of a clear biological significance, an adequate sample size (possibly more than 150 patients), no patient population bias, an adequate statistical test, such as Cox regression analysis, as well as optimized cut-off values and reproducibility. From a pathologist's view, prognostic factors with established values are grade, margin involvement, capsular penetration, seminal vesical involvement, metastases and invasion of fat in needle biopsies. In contrast to this, factors with little value are, among others, zone location or nuclear shape. If these guidelines for assessment of prognostic factors are not met, the prognostic factors grow exponentially, as an individual patient can only belong to one prognostic group. If one considers all three categories of prognostic factors together, the clinical stage matters most despite all uncertainties. The same holds true for grading; particularly, the well-differentiated grades on biopsy cores have the drawback of being reflected in the specimen only infrequently. The use of biomarkers to give a better prognostic information is also disappointing, as only PSA and PAP have a reliable value among 28 biomarkers. It is of note that new biomarkers are continuously being discovered and examined, such as cyclin A or D. Due to these deficiencies in all three categories of prognostic factors for prostatic carcinoma, prognostic indices in the form of nomograms were constructed. But, if these indices are employed to answer the most important question at the time of diagnosis, i.e., 'is this man a candidate for surveillance?', neoadjuvant treatment plus irradiation, neoadjuvant treatment plus radical prostatectomy, perineal radical prostatectomy, because of a low probability of extracapsular extension or positive lymph nodes, adjuvant therapy after local treatment with curative intent as opposed to progression-based treatment or immediate systemic treatment, let alone intermittent endocrine manipulation, are not reliably possible. The outcomes of the few available studies based on prognostic factors should be studied carefully. If considered, a valuable new way of estimating artificial neural networks is a possibility to come to practical terms. Copyright Copyright 1999 S. Karger AG, Basel [References: 47]	
4180	Increased efficacy of radiation therapy by use of proton beam	Boston, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Eye, Female, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Uncertainty	Proton beam treatment techniques provide a powerful approach to improving dose distribution (decrease treatment volume towards target volume) and hence increasing dose to target with resultant higher tumor control rates and lesser morbity. To achieve these dose distributions in patients requires use of modern imaging techniques, rigid immobilization systems, confirmation of target position vis a vis the proton beam at each treatment session, treatment planning which feature beam's eye view, displays of uncertainty, dose at each anatomic point, boli based on accurate assessment of density along each pixel, etc. Experience at MGH/MEEI/HCL has yielded a disease-free survival of 78% for patients with chordoma/chondrosarcoma of base of skull. Local control is achieved by 98% of patients treated for choroidal melanoma

To test this assumption, living HeLa-cells were irradiated at the irradiation setup of the ion microprobe SNAKE using the ion beams provided by the Munich 14 MV tandem accelerator. After irradiation, the distribution of 53BP1 protein foci was studied by immunofluorescence. The observed 53BP1 distribution along the tracks of 29 MeV (7)Li ions and 24 MeV (12)C ions differed significantly from the expectations resulting from the simple chromatin model, suggesting that the biological track structure is determined by cell nuclear architecture with higher order organisation of chromatin

Data on cancer incidence in Europe, Austria, and neighbouring countries are reviewed for the most frequent tumors suitable for charged particle therapy. From these data, the numbers of potential patients suitable for MED-AUSTRON are derived for each tumor site by applying the coefficients proposed in the EULIMA-1992 feasibility study. Whatever the assumptions made, a sufficient and adequate recruitment for MED-AUSTRON can be expected. However, an appropriate referring system has to be established within Austria and also in the neighbouring countries

1431	Lack of cell death enhancement after irradiation with monochromatic synchrotron X rays at the K-shell edge of platinum incorporated in living SQ20B human cells as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)	Calibration, Cell Cycle, Cell Death, Cell Line, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/de [Drug Effects], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cisplatin/pd [Pharmacology], Colony-Forming Units Assay, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence, France, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lead, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Photons, Platinum/pd [Pharmacology], Radiation, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/pd [Pharmacology], Research, Survival, Tumor Cells,Cultured, X-Rays	In this paper we describe the results of experiments using synchrotron radiation to trigger the Auger effect in living human cancer cells treated with a widely used chemotherapy drug: cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin). The experiments were carried out at the ID17 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which produces a high-fluence monochromatic beam that is adjustable from 20 to 80 keV. Cisplatin was chosen as the carrier of platinum atoms in the cells because of its alkylating-like activity and the irradiation was done with monochromatic beams above and below the platinum K-shell edge (78.39 keV). Cell survival curves were comparable with those obtained for the same cells under conventional irradiation conditions. At a low dose of cisplatin (0.1 microM, 48 h), no difference was seen in survival when the cells were irradiated above and below the K-shell edge of platinum. Higher cisplatin concentrations were investigated to enhance the cellular platinum content. The results with 1 microM cisplatin for 12 h showed no difference when the cells were irradiated with beams above or below the platinum K-shell edge with the exception of the higher cell death resulting from drug toxicity. The intracellular content of platinum was significant, as measured macroscopically by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Its subcellular localization and particularly its presence in the cell nucleus were verified by microscopic synchrotron X-ray fluorescence. This was the first known attempt at K-shell edge photon activation of stable platinum in living cells with a platinum complex used for chemotherapy. Its evident toxicity in these cells leads us to put forth the hypothesis that cisplatin toxicity can mask the enhancement of cell death induced by the irradiation above the K-shell edge. However, K-shell edge photon activation of stable elements provides a powerful technique for the understanding of the biological effects of Auger processes. Further avenues of development are discussed

3987	Comparison of systemic radiotherapy with I-131-labeled monoclonal antibody BW575/9 to external beam radiotherapy in human neuroblastoma xenografts	Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cell Adhesion Molecules,Neuronal/im [Immunology], Efficiency, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Mice, Mice,Inbred BALB C, Mice,Nude, Neoplasm Transplantation, Neuroblastoma, Neuroblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioimmunotherapy/mt [Methods], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Time, Transplantation,Heterologous	The therapeutic effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (XRT) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT) was investigated in a human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) xenotransplanted to nude mice. This tumor model seems especially suitable for comparison of the relative biological effectiveness of RIT vs. XRT, as--in contrast to most tumor models--it shows an unusually homogenous uptake of the labeled MAb, thus providing a homogenous intratumoral dose distribution. XRT was performed using single fractions of 800, 1600, 2000 and 2400 cGy and RIT was delivered by intravenous injection of 15, 19 and 26 MBq of the I-131-labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) BW575/9. Therapeutic efficiency of the two radiation modalities was assessed in terms of tumor volume doubling time (VDT). Miniature thermoluminescent (mini-TLD) dosimetry and MIRD-based dose calculations were used to evaluate the absorbed doses delivered by RIT and to assess the degree of homogeneity of the dose distribution. RIT with 19 MBq of the I-131 BW575/9 delivered a tumor dose of 2820 cGy measured by TLD and resulted in a tumor VDT of 32 days (vs. one day in controls). An equivalent effect on VDT was achieved by a single fraction XRT of 1600 cGy. The relative efficiency of XRT compared with RIT (ratio of dose XRT/dose RIT required to give the same VDT) was 0.57. Application of 26 MBq of the MAb (= 3200 cGy) resulted in complete tumor regression after ten days as did XRT with 2400 cGy, corresponding to a relative efficiency of 0.75

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

Up to now a therapeutic progress could not be achieved. Radiobiologic experimentations suggest that the dense ionisation is unfavorable in the irradiation of malignant cerebral tumors. The clinical radiotherapy research with protons should therefore be intensified and hyperfractionation should be critically reviewed. [References: 32]

ROKUS apparatus and a linear accelerator of 15 MeV were used for irradiation at a single dose of 1.5 Gy and a total dose of 3-6 Gy, at a 2-4 day interval. STI efficacy was assessed by a response of the peripheral and intrathoracic lymph nodes, tumor foci in the lungs, by a decrease in liver and spleen sizes, a decrease in body temperature and the end of night sweating. Of 25 patients a positive effect was achieved in 19, in 4 patients it was absent, and in 2 patients disease progression was observed. A marked positive effect was noted in 8 previously untreated patients, especially with respect to the elimination of signs of intoxication. A conclusion has been made that STI can be employed for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease patients as a method of general cytostatic action. STI causes a more noticeable and prolonged leukopenia than a cycle of polychemotherapy

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival	
20	Monte Carlo method to study the proton fluence for treatment planning	Algorithms, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	The proton beam at the Hahn Meitner Institute (HMI) in Berlin will be used for proton therapy of eye melanoma in the near future. As part of the pre-therapeutic studies, Monte Carlo calculations have been performed to investigate the primary fluence distribution of the proton beam including the influence of scattering foils, range shifters, modulator wheels, and collimators. Any material in the beam path will modify the therapeutic beam because of energy loss, multiple scattering, range straggling, and nuclear reactions. The primary fluence information is a pre-requisite for most pencil-beam treatment planning algorithms. The measured beam penumbra has been used as one of the parameters to characterize a proton beam for further calculations in a treatment planning algorithm. However, this phenomenological quantity represents only indirect information about the properties of the proton beam. In this work, an alternative parameterization of the beam exiting the vacuum window of the accelerator, as well as the beam right in front of the patient collimator, is introduced. A beam is fully characterized if one knows (for instance from Monte Carlo simulations) the particle distribution in energy, position, and angle, i.e., the phase space distribution. Therefore, parameters derived from this distribution can provide an alternative input in treatment planning algorithms. In addition, the method of calculation is introduced as a tool to investigate the influence of modifications in the beam delivery system on the behavior of the therapeutic proton beam

Initial estimates of the beam size indicate that additional collimating hardware will be needed for lower energy proton beams in order to achieve a clinically acceptable lateral dose falloff at the edge of the proton beam. In this report, we present dosimetric data from Monte Carlo simulations with a model of a simple multileaf collimator which indicate that such a device may be used to improve the lateral dose falloff. The dosimetric quantities relevant to the clinical usefulness of the device are studied, including lateral penumbra, leaf transmission and scalloping effect. Multileaf collimation is compared with a differential spot-weighting technique of sharpening the lateral dose falloff	
2133	Survival of human lung epithelial cells following in vitro alpha-particle irradiation with absolute determination of the number of alpha-particle traversals of individual cells	Alpha Particles, Biophysics, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Epithelial Cells/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Light, Lung, Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Norway, Radon, Research, Survival	PURPOSE: To throw light on human exposure to domestic radon and radon progeny, the effects of low doses of alpha-particle irradiation on normal human lung epithelial cells has been studied. At such low exposure levels the concept of dose is inadequate due to the stochastic variation in the number of alpha-particle traversals per cell. The objective of the current study was to establish an accurate survival curve for human lung epithelial cells with absolute determination of the exact number of alpha-particle traversals of individual cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Irradiation of L132 cells growing in tracketch detector-based cell dishes, was performed using a collimated alpha-particle beam from a 210Po source. The number of alpha-particle traversals through each individual cell was scored by using a technique of retrospective track-etch dosimetry. This technique is based upon image matching and mapping of corresponding cell and alpha-particle track images. The spatial resolution of the hit determination procedure was +/-0.9/microm. RESULTS: Surviving fractions of cells (SF) showed strict dependence on the number of nuclear traversals (n), with SF(n)= a exp(-bn), a=0.957 (+/- 0.046), b = 0.587 (+/- 0.059), R2 =98.8%. No significant dependence on the number of nuclear membrane traversals (m) or the number of cytoplasm traversals (c) was observed	
3338	Stereotactic radiotherapy of irregular targets: a comparison between static conformal beams and non-coplanar arcs	Female, Head/ra [Radiography], Humans, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Technology,Radiologic	Stereotactic radiotherapy using a linear accelerator is usually equated with the technique of delivery using multiple non-coplanar arcs, which achieves a spherical dose distribution. As the majority of intracranial lesions are not spherical, a range of schematized tumour shapes were planned to assess the role of static conformal beams in the treatment of irregular lesions. A sphere and 2 ellipsoids, ranging from 20 to 50 mm maximum diameter located intracranially were planned using 3, 4, and 6 non-coplanar static beams with conformal blocks and were compared with four 120 degree non-coplanar arcs. Comparison of the plans was made by the relative sparing of normal tissue outside the target volume using three-dimensional dose-volume distributions. Non-coplanar arcs spared more normal tissue at low isodoses and achieved the best high dose sparing for spherical targets. For the majority of irregular targets, 3 and 4 static beams spared more tissue at doses > or = 50% and > or = 80% than the arc technique. For all irregular volumes, maximum sparing of normal tissue to isodoses > or = 50% and > or = 80% of the treatment isodose was obtained with 6 static conformal beams. We conclude that irregularly shaped tumours suitable for stereotactic radiotherapy with a linear accelerator are better treated with conformal static non-coplanar beams rather than with the multiple arc technique

1528	Abutment region dosimetry for the monoisocentric three-beam split field technique in the head and neck region using asymmetrical collimators	Film Dosimetry, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Jaw, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	Creating non-divergent field edges using asymmetric collimators and a single isocentre can improve matchline dosimetry owing to decreased reliance on operator skills and avoidance of couch movement. However, asymmetic jaws have an associated tolerance that can cause abutment to be misaligned. The matching area dose for monoisocentric three-beam split fields commonly used in head and neck cancer treatments using mismatched and matched collimators is the subject of this work. X-ray verification film was exposed in a solid-water phantom, and the dose at the matching area was evaluated using mismatched and matched collimators. In the case of mismatched (consistently overlapped) collimators, digital displays of an asymmetric collimator position within the tolerance indicated in the manufacturer's specifications were investigated for the three-beam split field technique. The effect of this technique on the junctional dose was also determined using matched collimators. Although the collimators showed a consistent overlap, a perfect dose distribution could be obtained at the matching area. The three-beam split field technique yielded an 8% overdose at the matchline using matched collimators. In conclusion, an awareness of the effects of the abutting technique and digital display tolerance is necessary to achieve good junction uniformity using asymmetric collimators	
3600	Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors: reduction of the supratentorial target volume	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Eye, Humans, Methods, Morbidity, Neuroectodermal Tumors,Primitive/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Recurrence, Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: One of the components of radiotherapy (RT) in medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors is the prophylactic irradiation of the whole brain (WBI). With the aim of reducing late neuropsychologic morbidity a CT-scan-based dosimetric study was undertaken in which treatment was confined mainly or exclusively to supratentorial sites considered at high risk for disease recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comparative dosimetric study is presented in which a three field (two laterals and one posterior) proton plan (spot scanning method) is compared with a two-field conventional WBI 6 MV x-ray plan, to a 6-field "hand-made" 6 MV x-ray plan, and to a computer-optimized 9-field "inverse" 15 MV x-ray plan. For favorable patients, 30 Gy were delivered to the ventricles and main cisterns, the subfrontal and subtemporal regions, and the posterior fossa. For the unfavorable patients, 10 Gy WBI preceeded a boost to 30 Gy to the same treatment volume chosen for favorable patients. The dose distribution was evaluated with dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the targets as well as the dose to the nontarget brain and optical structures. In addition, the risks of radiation-related late neuropsychologic effects after WBI were collected from the literature and used to predict normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) for an intelligence quotient deficit after treatment with photon or proton beams. RESULTS: Proton beams succeeded better in reducing the dose to the brain hemispheres and eye than any of the photon plans. A 25.1% risk of an IQ score <90 was predicted after 30 Gy WBI. Almost a 10% drop in the predicted risk was observed when using proton beams in both favorable and unfavorable patients. However, predicted NTCPs for both optimized photon plans ("hand made" and "inverse") were only slightly higher (0.3-2.5%) than those of proton beams. An age-modifying factor was introduced in the predictive NTCP model to assess for IQ differences in relation with age at irradiation. Children with ages between age 4 to 8 benefitted most from the dose reduction in this exercise (similar NTCP predictions for both proton and "inverse" plans). CONCLUSION: Modulated proton beams may help to significantly reduce the irradiation of normal brain while optimally treating the supratentorial subsites at higher risk for relapse. A decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons and both optimized proton plans compared to WBI	
2622	A performance study of the Loma Linda proton medical accelerator	Biophysics, California, Californium, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radio Waves, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Synchrotrons/is [Instrumentation], Time, Universities	More than three years have passed since Loma Linda treated the first cancer patient with the world's first proton accelerator dedicated to radiation therapy. Since that time, over 1000 patients have completed treatments and the facility currently treats more than 45 patients per day. With a typical intensity of 3 x 10(10) protons per pulse and 27 pulses per minute, dose rates of 90-100 cGy/min are easily achieved on a 20-cm diameter field. In most cases, patient treatment times are 2 min, much less than the patient alignment time required before each treatment. Nevertheless, there is considerable medical interest in increasing field sizes up to 40-cm diameter while keeping dose rates high and treatment times low. In this article, beam measurements relevant to intensity studies are presented and possible accelerator modifications for upgrades are proposed. It is shown that nearly all intensity losses can be ascribed to the large momentum spread of the injected beam and occur at or near the injection energy of 2 MeV. The agreement between calculations and measurements appears quite good. In addition, optimum beam characteristics for a new injector are discussed based upon the momentum acceptance and space charge limits of the Loma Linda synchrotron

4422	Verification and implementation of dynamic wedge calculations in a treatment planning system based on a dose-to-energy-fluence formalism	Biophysics, Computers, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Sweden, Technology,Radiologic, Time, Universities	The use of dynamic movements on linear accelerators during irradiation has found a revised interest lately due to the integration of computers to control the accelerator. In this paper, dynamic wedge fields that are produced by moving one of the collimator blocks during irradiation are studied. Since these wedge fields differ from those of mechanical wedges, certain requirements are to be met on the treatment planning system. A pencil-beam-based treatment planning system that uses the resultant energy fluence distribution from the dynamic collimator movement has been extensively reviewed. In calculations, the system treats the dynamic collimated field as a single, modulated field that yields calculation times close to those for open beams. Details are given on the theoretical model used for the calculation of dynamically generated dose distributions. Measurements of depth doses, profiles, and output factors in dynamic wedge fields indicate that calculations accurately predict the outcome from dynamic wedges without any additional measurements other than those used for characterization of static open beams

We treated nine AVM, 12 metastatic brain tumors, two malignant lymphomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, two meningiomas, and one brain tumor of unknown pathology. In the follow-up examinations at least five months after treatment, the local control rate was 83% for the metastatic tumors, and two malignant lymphomas disappeared completely. In addition, satisfactory results have been obtained with AVM and other brain tumors without any side effects. In comparison with gamma-knife radiosurgery, linac radiosurgery has some disadvantages such as longer treatment time and cumbersome accuracy control, but if accuracy control is performed periodically, accuracies of 1 mm or less can be obtained. There is some strengths of linac radiosurgery as follow. 1) The acquisition cost is relatively low. 2) Dose distribution are equivalent to gamma-knife. 3) There is no field size limitation. 4) There is great flexibility in beam delivery and linac systems. Radiosurgery using linear accelerators seems to become widely accepted in the future	
1984	No dose-dependence of DNA double-strand break misrejoining following alpha-particle irradiation	Alpha Particles, Cells,Cultured, Cytological Techniques, DNA, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts, Germany, Humans, Radiation, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To investigate whether an explanation for the high effectiveness of densely ionizing radiation with regard to complex biological endpoints can be derived from measurements of radiation-induced double-strand break (DSB) misrejoining. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Misrejoining of radiation-induced DSB in normal human fibroblasts was determined by comparing hybridization analysis of large restriction fragments as a measure for correct rejoining, with results from a conventional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis technique (FAR) that measures total DSB rejoining. In order to investigate DSB misrejoining at doses for which chromosome aberration data are available, a dose fractionation protocol was applied so that the number of DSB at any given timepoint was low but the cumulative amount of misrejoined DSB sufficient for detection and precise quantitation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After an acute 80Gy alpha-particle exposure and a repair incubation period of 24 h, 50% of all initially induced DSB were misrejoined, in agreement with data obtained for X-rays. X-irrradiation with 16 x 5 Gy, 8 x 10 Gy, 4 x 20 Gy, or 2 x 40 Gy and repair incubation of 24 h following each individual dose fraction was recently reported to yield misrejoining frequencies that strongly decrease with increasing fractionation (Lobrich et al. 2000; Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer, 27, 59-68). In the present study, constant misrejoining frequencies of 50% were observed after alpha-particle exposure with the same fractionation protocol. This difference between alpha-particles and X-rays is in accordance with the high biological effectiveness of densely ionizing radiation and provides a direct link between misrejoining of DSB and cytologically visible exchange aberrations. Further evidence suggests that if the same dose range is compared, the number of misrejoined DSB exceeds the number of microscopically visible aberrations by an order of magnitude for both radiation types, probably reflecting the high resolution of the hybridization approach compared with cytological techniques	
1079	Survival analysis in patients with glioblastoma multiforme: predictive value of choline-to-N-acetylaspartate index, apparent diffusion coefficient, and relative cerebral blood volume	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Blood Volume, Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Choline/me [Metabolism], Diffusion, Glioblastoma/me [Metabolism], Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/pp [Physiopathology], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, Protons, Radiation, Research, Survival, Survival Analysis, Time	PURPOSE: To investigate the potential value of pre-external-beam radiation therapy (XRT) choline-to-NAA (N-acetylaspartate) index (CNI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) for predicting survival in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with GBM were studied using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) and diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging after surgery but prior to XRT. Patients were categorized on the basis of their volumes of morphologic and metabolic abnormalities (volume of CNI > or = 2 and CNI values), normalized ADC (nADC), or rCBV values within the T1 contrast-enhancing and T2 regions. The median survival time was compared. RESULTS: A significantly shorter median survival time was observed for patients with a large volume of metabolic abnormality than for those with a small abnormality (12.0 and 17.1 months, respectively, P = 0.002). A similar pattern was observed for patients with a low mean nADC value compared to those with high mean nADC value within the T2 region (11.2 and 21.7 months, respectively, P = 0.004). A shorter median survival time was also observed for patients with contrast-enhancing residual disease than for those without the presence of contrast enhancement with marginal significance. CONCLUSION: The pre-XRT volume of the metabolic abnormality and the nADC value within the T2 region may be valuable in predicting outcome for patients with GBM. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc	
2797	New surgical method to prevent pelvic radiation enteropathy	Absorption, Aged, Boston, Female, Humans, Massachusetts, Morbidity, Pelvis, Polyglycolic Acid/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protein-Losing Enteropathies/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Rectal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Surgical Mesh, Time, Universities	Pelvic radiation doses exceeding 4,000-4,500 cGy are known to be associated with acute and chronic radiation enteropathy. This same radiation dose is, at the same time, only moderately effective in the elimination of microscopic malignancy, let alone gross clinical disease. Numerous medical and surgical attempts to minimize this complication have been uniformly unsuccessful. With the availability of a new synthetic, absorbable, polyglycolic acid mesh, an intestinal sling surgical procedure has been devised to exclude the small bowel from the pelvis and subsequent radiation fields. Twenty-five patients have been treated by this new technique with only one complication presenting as a fungal infection. Small-bowel barium contrast studies in 16 patients referred for postoperative radiation demonstrated 13 satisfactory exclusions of the small bowel from the translateral pelvic irradiation field. In 16 evaluable patients, three had unsatisfactory exclusion two of which were due to technical error. This has permitted high-dose (5,500-6,500 cGy) radiotherapy to the critical treatment volume without posttreatment complication. Mean follow-up time is 14.8 months. Several patients have been reexplored demonstrating complete absorption of the mesh without fibrinous adhesions or other foreign body reaction. It is concluded that this new technique of small bowel exclusion will permit the routine delivery of much higher doses of radiation in patients requiring improved local-regional control of their pelvic cancers and without morbidity from radiation-associated small bowel injury

The tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density, and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing method

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone

However, psychological distress and anxiety related to irradiation are often observed. Purpose of our study was the evaluation of the influence of radiotherapy-induced distress in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and June 1996 in 48 breast cancer patients (31 to 76 years old) treated by breast-conserving surgery adjuvant irradiation with or without systemic therapy was applied. On the first and the last day of radiotherapy they were given a questionnaire (Table 1) which was designed together with psychologists. Covering different situations related to radiotherapy the construction of items are determined by factors with possible influence on psychological distress and perception with regard to irradiation. RESULTS: Most of the women (92%) stated to be well informed about the irradiation and tried to obtain further information about this treatment (83%). 56% tried not to think about radiotherapy and/or to distract themselves (81%). 40% were anxious about the fact to undergo irradiation. In the end of treatment 77% reported to have been anxious only initially or never; only 19% were anxious almost or most of the time. 35% were worried about the expected cosmetic alterations of their breast; only 30% observed acute cosmetic changes. With regard to situation-related distress all patients (100%) stated that the communication with the medical staff made it easier to stand the irradiation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of theoretical considerations our results are explorative in character. However, following statements seem to be important: 1. A large requirement exists to get information about radiotherapy. 2. The patients experience irradiation treatment more positive than initially expected by themselves. 3. With regard to radiotherapy anxiety is reduced during the course of treatment. Here the psychosocial care of the medical staff is an important support for reduction of anxiety

The radiotherapy followed the guidelines of the M.D. Anderson Hospital, Houston and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London using a multiple field technique. A median dose of 68 Gy megavoltage radiotherapy was given to the primary and of 66 Gy to the neck nodes independent of the histologic subtype. The determinate relapse-free survival was 45% after five years and the local relapse-free survival 61%. The multiple field technique allowed to reduce the dose to the parotid. Only 25% of the patients suffered from a dry mouth after one year and only 10% after four years

The main focus will be on those problems which are unique to high energy proton accelerators, and which may not be necessarily associated with the proton beam operation itself. [References: 30]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four patients with fully excised, Stage I breast cancer treated with adjuvant proton 3D-CPBI had treatment plans generated using the mixed-modality, photon-electron 3D-CPBI technique. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, planning target volumes (PTVs; lumpectomy site plus 1.5-2.0 cm margin) and prescribed dose (32 Gy) were held constant. Plans were optimized for PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Proton and mixed-modality plans both provided acceptable PTV coverage with 95% of the PTV receiving 90% of the prescribed dose in all cases. Both techniques also provided excellent dose homogeneity with a dose maximum exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose in only one case. Proton 3D-CPBI reduced the volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose by an average of 36%. Statistically significant reductions in the volume of total ipsilateral breast receiving 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the prescribed dose were also observed. The use of protons resulted in small, but statistically significant, reductions in the radiation dose delivered to 5%, 10%, and 20% of ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart. The nontarget breast tissue dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI were not dependent on tumor location, breast size, PTV size, or the ratio of PTV to breast volume. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to photon-electron 3D-CPBI, proton 3D-CPBI significantly reduces the volume of irradiated nontarget breast tissue. Both approaches to accelerated partial breast irradiation offer exceptional lung and heart sparing

Fifteen patients with urinary malignant tumors were treated by proton irradiation during the period from June, 1985 to March, 1989 at Particle Radiation Medical Center, University of Tsukuba. Four patients were with renal cell carcinoma, five with prostatic cancer and six with bladder cancer. Treatment results were assessed by change in tumor size either three or six months after the irradiation. In all the four cases with renal cell carcinoma, the tumor sizes were found to be unchanged without any enlargement. Of the five cases with prostatic cancer, two showed that the treatment was effective and the tumor sizes in the other three cases were found to be unchanged. In three of the six cases with bladder cancer the tumors disappeared while the treatment was found effective in two other and it did not cause any enlargement of the tumor in the remaining one. Although local control of the tumor was successful in all the cases, one patient with prostatic cancer and three with bladder cancer died of cancer. Various side effects, such as radiation cystitis, were observed. This prospective therapy is expected to replace the conventional photon therapy. However, some improvement is needed to make full use of the advantageous properties in dose distribution. Combination therapy with other general therapy is required for some cases

The monitor consists of a pair of scintillating fibers and photodiode read-out circuits that measure the energy dependence of electron transmission through a wedge-shaped absorber. A linear energy response and 1% accuracy for energy constancy measurements are attained with the monitor. The monitor having advantages of simple mechanical and electronic constructions, small size, and low cost is suitable for practical use as a portable device	
3353	Proton and heavy ion therapy	Electrons, Gamma Rays, Humans, Ions, Neutrons, Nuclear Medicine/is [Instrumentation], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Research	Penetrating ion beams are considered interesting supplements to the types of radiation, mostly electrons and gamma rays, that have dominated in radiation research and radiotherapy during the last decades. Biomedical experimentations and clinical studies ar larger ion accelerators (100-1000 MeV/amu) are therefore undertaken in order to exploit their possible clinical use in cancer therapy. It is concluded that an accelerator that permits effective use of protons (ca. 200 MeV) and deutrons (ca. 50 MeV, for neutron therapy) located in a central hospital would represent a convenient tool for clinical investigations at a larger scale	
376	Accounting for range uncertainties in the optimization of intensity modulated proton therapy	Algorithms, Humans, Massachusetts, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated, Research	Treatment plans optimized for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may be sensitive to range variations. The dose distribution may deteriorate substantially when the actual range of a pencil beam does not match the assumed range. We present two treatment planning concepts for IMPT which incorporate range uncertainties into the optimization. The first method is a probabilistic approach. The range of a pencil beam is assumed to be a random variable, which makes the delivered dose and the value of the objective function a random variable too. We then propose to optimize the expectation value of the objective function. The second approach is a robust formulation that applies methods developed in the field of robust linear programming. This approach optimizes the worst case dose distribution that may occur, assuming that the ranges of the pencil beams may vary within some interval. Both methods yield treatment plans that are considerably less sensitive to range variations compared to conventional treatment plans optimized without accounting for range uncertainties. In addition, both approaches--although conceptually different--yield very similar results on a qualitative level

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and February 1997, 24 patients with histopathologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were treated to 15 fractions within 5 weeks in a step-wise dose-escalation study. The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92% and 92%, 81% and 50%, and 81% and 25% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy appears safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional clinical studies using a larger subject group are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy

Here we present data obtained with the ion path parallel to a monolayer of human fibroblast cells that leads to gamma-H2AX aggregates in the shape of streaks stretching over several micrometers in an x/y plane, thus enabling the analysis of the fluorescence distributions along the ion trajectories. Qualitative analyses of these distributions provide insights into DNA damage processing kinetics for high charge and energy (HZE) ions, including evidence of increased clustering of DNA damage and slower processing with increasing LET

As the RBE depends on the linear energy transfer (LET), we present a fast method for three-dimensional calculations of the dose-averaged LET. The corresponding algorithm, based on an analytical expression for the LET and on Monte Carlo simulations, accounts for tissue inhomogeneities and allows LET calculations for realistic treatment plans and patient geometries given by computed tomography (CT) data sets. LET distributions were calculated for different proton spot scanning techniques, in particular for the full three-dimensional (3D) modulation and for the distal edge tracking technique (DET). In the case of 3D modulation, a more homogeneous distribution of LET in the planning target volume was observed than for the DET. Consequently, the proposed method allows to assess the impact of potential variations in RBE for various dose delivery techniques

METHODS AND MATERIALS : Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p < 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up	
313	Cone-beam CT using a mobile C-arm: a registration solution for IGRT with an optical tracking system	Calibration, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	A method for registering images acquired from a prototype flat panel mobile C-arm, capable of kilovoltage (kV) cone-beam computed tomography (CT), to a linear accelerator (LINAC) isocenter is presented. A calibration procedure is performed which involves locating reflective markers placed on the C-arm and a phantom in two coordinate systems. A commercial optical tracking system locates the markers relative to the LINAC isocenter (room coordinates). The cone-beam imaging capabilities of the C-arm provide the location of the markers on the calibration phantom in image coordinates. A singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is used to determine the relationship between the C-arm, image coordinates and room coordinates. Once the calibration is completed, the position of the C-arm at any arbitrary location is accurately determined from the tracking system. A final transformation is calculated capable of mapping voxels in the reconstructed image set to their corresponding position in room coordinates. An evaluation to determine the accuracy of this method was performed by locating markers on a phantom. The position of the phantom markers in room coordinates was obtained directly using the optical tracking system and compared with that using the described method above. A mean absolute distance of 1.4+/-0.5 was observed for a completely transformed image set. This is comparable to that of systems routinely used for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)	
1495	Image reconstruction algorithm for a rotating slat collimator	Algorithms, Brain/ra [Radiography], Computer Simulation, Gamma Cameras, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time Factors, Utah	A slat collimator in single photon emission computed tomography consists of a set of parallel slats. As the collimator spins, the detector measures a one-dimensional projection data set. A complete data set can be obtained by rotating the detector/collimator assembly around the object (patient) while the collimator spins continuously. The measured projection data are assumed to be weighted planar integrals of the object. This paper describes the development of an approximate three-dimensional image reconstruction algorithm for a rotating/spinning slat collimator. This algorithm is in filtered backprojection form. Computer simulations were performed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm	
2010	Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometric analysis of the recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor beta and derivatives	Amino Acid Sequence, Calibration, Chromatography,High Pressure Liquid, Cyclotrons, Escherichia coli/me [Metabolism], Fourier Analysis, Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factors,Recombinant/an [Analysis], Humans, Ions, Mass Spectrometry, Molecular Sequence Data, Oregon, Oxidation-Reduction, Peptide Fragments/an [Analysis], Protein Folding, Research, Universities	The potential of electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to assist in the structural characterization of monomeric and dimeric derivatives of the macrophage colony stimulating factor beta (rhM-CSF beta) was assessed. Mass spectrometric analysis of the 49 kDa protein required the use of sustained off-resonance irradiation (SORI) in-trap cleanup to reduce adduction. High resolution mass spectra were acquired for a fully reduced and a fully S-cyanylated monomeric derivative (approximately 25 kDa). Mass accuracy for monomeric derivatives was better than 5 ppm, after applying a new calibration method (i.e., DeCAL) which eliminates space charge effects upon high accuracy mass measurements. This high mass accuracy allowed the direct determination of the exact number of incorporated cyanyl groups. Collisionally induced dissociation using SORI yielded b- and y-fragment ions within the N- and C-terminal regions for the monomeric derivatives, but obtaining information on other regions required proteolytic digestion, or potentially the use of alternative dissociation methods	
2599	Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone. Diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases and review of the literature	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Bone, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects	
534	The impact of IMRT and proton radiotherapy on secondary cancer incidence	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Incidence, Male, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Risk Factors, Scattering,Radiation, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is concern about the increase of radiation-induced malignancies with the application of modern radiation treatment techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and proton radiotherapy. Therefore, X-ray scatter and neutron radiation as well as the impact of the primary dose distribution on secondary cancer incidence are analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential and a plateau dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 30 patients who received radiation therapy of prostate cancer. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used in eleven patients, another eleven patients received IMRT with 6-MV photons, and eight patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. The treatment plans were recalculated with 15-MV and 18-MV photons. Secondary cancer risk was estimated based on the OED for the different treatment techniques. RESULTS: A modest increase of 15% radiation-induced cancer results from IMRT using low energies (6 MV), compared to conventional four-field planning with 15-MV photons (plateau dose-response: 1%). The probability to develop a secondary cancer increases with IMRT of higher energies by 20% and 60% for 15 MV and 18 MV, respectively (plateau dose-response: 2% and 30%). The use of spot-scanned protons can reduce secondary cancer incidence as much as 50% (independent of dose-response). CONCLUSION: By including the primary dose distribution into the analysis of radiation-induced cancer incidence, the resulting increase in risk for secondary cancer using modern treatment techniques such as IMRT is not as dramatic as expected from earlier studies. By using 6-MV photons, only a moderate risk increase is expected. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice in regard to secondary cancer incidence

[French]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Prevalence, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Reproduction, Retrospective Studies	To evaluate irradiation effects on choroidal melanomas, histopathologic findings of 18 eyes whose primary treatment was enucleation were compared to 15 eyes enucleated after proton beam irradiation. Irradiated tumors showed more likely necrosis (p = 0.01) had balloon cells (p = 0.01), and inflammatory infiltrate (p = 0.05). In the irradiated group, the prevalence of tumor blood vessel damage was higher (p = 0.0002) and mitotic figures were fewer (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that proton beam irradiation damages tumor cells and alters the tumor's capacity for cellular reproduction. It damages blood vessels leading to tumor necrosis. It induces an inflammatory response of unknown effects. Radiosensitivity of choroidal melanomas cannot be assessed using conventional histologic methods. However, tumor necrosis, mitotic activity and rate of balloon cells can help to establish tumoral sensitivity to irradiation	
3170	[Biological effect of carbon beams on cultured human cells]. [Japanese]	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carbon, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Cell Line, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Cyclotrons, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities, X-Rays	This study was performed to determine the biological effect of carbon beams on 13 human tumor cells, in comparison with 200 KVp X-rays. Carbon beams were generated by the Riken Ring Cyclotron. The RBE (relative biological effectiveness) values were distributed from 1.46 to 2.20 for LET of 20 ke V/micron, and 2.29-3.54 for 80 keV/micron. The RBEs were increased in all cell lines as the LET of carbon beams was increased from 20 to 80 keV/micron. There was no significant difference in radiosensitivity between cells from adenocarcinoma and those from squamous cell carcinoma. The relationship between the radiosensitivity of cells to X-rays and RBE was analyzed, but no significant correlation was suggested. Several survival curves of 20-40 keV/micron carbon beam irradiation showed the initial shoulders and the recovery ratios between two split doses were determined. Recovery was observed for LET of 20 keV/micron but not for that of 40 keV/micron. Furthermore, recovery ratios were 1.0-1.8, smaller than those for X-rays (1.5-2.4)	
333	The use of extended dose range film for dosimetric calibration of a scanning liquid-filled ionization chamber electronic portal imaging device	Air, Calibration, Electronics, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Portal System/ra [Radiography], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research	A scanning liquid-filled ionization chamber electronic portal imaging device (SLIC-EPID) and extended dose range (EDR2) films were used to evaluate transmitted dose profiles for homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms. Calibrated ionization chamber measurements were used to convert the pixel values acquired from the electronic portal images to dose. Because SLIC-EPID was developed to have a uniform response for all liquid ionization chambers, the off-axis dose values were reconstructed using a correction factor matrix, defined as the ratio of the relative EDR2 film and the corresponding EPID dose values measured in air. The transmitted dose distributions in the EPID detector layer were also modeled using a Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (TPS: Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA). The gamma function algorithm was then used to assess agreement between transmitted dose distributions measured using a SLIC-EPID and EDR2 film, and those calculated using the TPS. For homogenous and inhomogeneous phantoms, more than 90% agreement was achieved using gamma criteria of 2% and 3 mm and 3% and 2.5 mm respectively. Our results indicate that the calibration procedure proposed in the present study should be performed if SLIC-EPID is to be used as a reliable two-dimensional transmitted dosimeter for clinical purposes	
4248	An estimation of the relative biological effectiveness of 50 MV bremsstrahlung beams by microdosimetric techniques	Algorithms, Animals, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/de [Drug Effects], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Jejunum/cy [Cytology], Jejunum/re [Radiation Effects], Models,Biological, Neutrons, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, Sweden, X-Rays	An efficient algorithm has been developed to estimate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) from experimental RBE data and measured single-event energy deposition spectra. As benchmarks for the calculations well established RBE data for crypt cell survival and associated microdosimetric distributions from a number of therapeutic high- and low-LET beams was used. As a by-product of the calculations the RBE for this system was determined for the lineal energy range 0.1-5000 keV microns-1 in very good agreement with experimental data. These data have been applied to estimate the biological effectiveness of therapeutic high-energy bremsstrahlung beams characterized by microdosimetric measurements with a wall-less proportional counter. The absorbed dose component due to photoneutrons and charged particles from photonuclear reactions in scanned 50 MV bremsstrahlung beams was measured to be about 2% of the total absorbed dose. The RBE of 50 MV scanned bremsstrahlung beams was estimated to be 1.09 for jejunum crypt cell survival as the biological endpoint at absorbed doses of the order of 10 Gy, in fair agreement with reported results based on radiobiological experiments. The RBE is fairly independent of the bremsstrahlung target used. Using the estimated increase in the RBE of neutrons compared to photons for absorbed dose levels applied in clinical fractionation schedules increases the RBE further to 1.13 at absorbed doses per fraction of the order of 2 Gy	
4013	Chromosome aberration frequencies in human lymphocytes irradiated in a multi-layer array by protons with different LET	Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Environment, Gamma Rays, Germany, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Lymphocytes/ul [Ultrastructure], Metaphase, Methods, Protons, Radiation, Radiobiology, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research	PURPOSE: To provide data on the dose-and linear energy transfer (LET)-dependence of the production of dicentrics in human lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Track segment irradiation with 16.5 MeV protons was performed in a multi-layer array allowing the simultaneous exposure of human peripheral lymphocytes in three successive samples. Within these samples the dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LD) of protons increased with increasing depth, i.e. LD = 3.5, 5.3 and 19.0 keV/microm. Dicentrics were scored in first division solid-stained metaphases. RESULTS: Dicentric yields measured in the first and second samples fit the linear-quadratic model, those of the third sample fit a linear model of the dose response relationship. Relative to 137Cs gamma-rays, limiting RBE values of 2.9, 4.3 and 21.5 were determined from the ratios of the respective linear coefficients of the dose effect curves. The linear dose effect coefficient increases approximately proportionally with increasing LET. The quadratic coefficient is approximately constant for protons with LD of 3.5 and 5.3 keV/microm, and is not significantly different from zero at LD= 19.0 keV/microm. CONCLUSION: This result is well in line with theoretical predictions on the variations of dose-effect coefficients with radiation quality. However, such an evaluation can only be obtained from clearly defined track segment experiments	
131	The sensitivity of the in vitro cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay in lymphocytes for different and combined radiation qualities	Adult, Cell Division, Confidence Intervals, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Germany, Humans, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Micronucleus Tests/mt [Methods], Neutrons, Poisson Distribution, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Sensitivity and Specificity, X-Rays	PURPOSE: The dose-response relationship and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for the induction of micronuclei in lymphocytes was analyzed after irradiation in vitro with a 6-MeV neutron beam that was followed by 240-kV X-rays. The dose range of the combined exposure comprised 1 to 3 Gy. For reference, the dose-effect relationships found after X-ray (0.5 to 5 Gy)- and neutron (0.5 to 4 Gy) exposure applied separately are presented. The possibility of an interaction between the 2 radiation qualities is investigated by the method of isobole calculation termed "envelope of additivity". METHODS: Micronuclei were analyzed in PHA-stimulated, cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes. RESULTS: The dose-response relationships for the micronucleus frequencies induced by the neutron irradiation, as well as by the mixed exposure, were linear. A saturation effect was indicated after neutron doses higher than 3 Gy. After low LET exposure the dose-response curves were describable by a linear-quadratic model. For neutron-induced micronucleus frequencies, RBE-values of 2 to 3 and for the combined exposure RBE values of 1.5 to 2 were calculated for a range of effect of 0.5 to 1.5 micronuclei/binucleated lymphocyte. No indication was found for an interaction between the damage induced by X-rays and that produced by neutrons under our experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate a clear dependence of micronucleus induction on radiation quality and emphasize the usefulness of the micronucleus assay in biological dosimetry, also in cases in which high LET radiation or a mixed beam is involved as the radiation source	
840	Technology insight: Proton beam radiotherapy for treatment in pediatric brain tumors.[erratum appears in Nat Clin Pract Oncol. 2005 Apr;2(4):222]. [Review] [47 refs]	Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Humans, Massachusetts, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal	Tumors of the central nervous system are the most common solid tumor in childhood. Treatment options for childhood brain tumors include radiation therapy, surgery and chemotherapy, often given in combination. Radiation therapy regularly has a pivotal role in treatment, and technological advancements during the past quarter of a century have dramatically improved the ability to deliver radiation in a more focused manner. Improvements in imaging and computing ability led to better targeting of tumor tissue using conventional X-ray therapy. These advances have been harnessed for proton radiation therapy. Proton radiotherapy has special physical characteristics that allow normal tissues to be spared better than even the most conformal photon radiation, and it will reduce the complications from treatment. This review discusses the characteristics of proton radiation, and describes examples of pediatric brain tumor patients who would benefit most from this form of treatment. [References: 47]

Scans of the light and radiation fields are made sequentially using a photodiode on standard field plotting apparatus. By superimposing the two plots, differences between the two fields' boundaries can be accurately determined. The technique is simple and avoids uncertainties inherent in common techniques employing film	
4003	Evaluation of internal alpha-particle radiation exposure and subsequent fertility among a cohort of women formerly employed in the radium dial industry	Abortion,Spontaneous/ep [Epidemiology], Administration,Oral, Adult, Alpha Particles, Anemia/ep [Epidemiology], Birth Rate, Body Burden, Cohort Studies, Comorbidity, Connecticut/ep [Epidemiology], Databases,Factual, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Fertility/re [Radiation Effects], Follow-Up Studies, Fractures,Bone/ep [Epidemiology], Humans, Hypertension/ep [Epidemiology], Illinois, Illinois/ep [Epidemiology], Infant,Newborn, Infertility,Female/ep [Epidemiology], Infertility,Female/et [Etiology], Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], New Jersey/ep [Epidemiology], Occupational Exposure, Paint/ae [Adverse Effects], Parity, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Outcome, Pregnancy Rate, Public Health, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Radium, Research, Time, Universities, Women	This study examined the effect of internal exposure to alpha-particle radiation on subsequent fertility among women employed in the radium dial industry prior to 1930, when appreciable amounts of radium were often ingested through the practice of pointing the paint brush with the lips. The analysis was limited to women for whom a radium body burden measurement had been obtained and who were married prior to age 45 (n = 603). Internal radiation dose to the ovary was calculated based on initial intakes of radium-226 and radium-228, average ovarian mass, number and energy of alpha particles emitted, fraction of energy absorbed within the ovary, effective retention integrals and estimated photon irradiation. Time between marriage and pregnancy, number of pregnancies and number of live births served as surrogates for fertility. Radiation appeared to have no effect on fertility at estimated cumulative ovarian dose equivalents below 5 Sv; above this dose, however, statistically significant declines in both number of pregnancies and live births were observed. These trends persisted after multivariable adjustment for potential confounding variables and after exclusion of subjects contributing a potential classification or selection bias to the study. Additionally, the high-dose group experienced fewer live births than would have been expected based on population rates. There were no differences in time to first pregnancy between high- and low-dose groups. These results are consistent with earlier studies of gamma-ray exposures and suggest that exposure to high doses of radiation from internally deposited radium reduces fertility rather than inducing sterility	
26	13C imaging by double resonance scalar-coupling editing	Carbon, Carbon Isotopes, Glucose, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/is [Instrumentation], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Phantoms,Imaging/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Protons, Water	The two-dimensional FT Imaging of 13C-glucose obtained with twin spin-echo double resonance sequence is presented. The images have been obtained by a doubly tuned surface coil on samples containing water and 13C-enriched glucose in water. It is shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that the whole editing capability of the twin spin-echo double resonance imaging sequence is also preserved in the presence of the radiofrequency field inhomogeneity produced by the surface coil. As in an efficient selective irradiation method, the enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to the direct 13C detection, depends on the number of protons J-coupled to 13C

However, analysis of track-etch images is both tedious and time-consuming. We describe here several image processing tools that we are using in conjunction with a track-etch based irradiator. Briefly, cells grown on LR 115 (a track-etch material) are irradiated from below by a collimated, planar alpha-particle source. Prior to irradiation, images of the cells are obtained. A computer program reads each image and automatically determines the location of individual cells. Next, the algorithm automatically identifies the cellular and nuclear boundaries. Following irradiation, and after the cells have reached their biological endpoint (e.g., cell survival), the cell dish is etched and images are obtained of alpha-particle tracks. Using the characteristic background pattern in the LR 115, the etched images are spatially registered to the original images. These two sets of images are then superimposed to create a composite image of the cells and associated alpha-particle tracks. Incorporating this tool into our irradiation scheme will enable more efficient analysis of the large amounts of data that are essential in assessing biological endpoints	
4622	Enhancement of SPHK1 in vitro by carbon ion irradiation in oral squamous cell carcinoma	Adaptor Proteins,Signal Transducing/me [Metabolism], Adaptor Proteins,Signal Transducing/re [Radiation Effects], Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/ge [Genetics], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Cell Death, Cell Line, Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival/ge [Genetics], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling/mt [Methods], Gene Expression/re [Radiation Effects], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Methods, Microarray Analysis/mt [Methods], Mouth Neoplasms, Mouth Neoplasms/ge [Genetics], Mouth Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nucleic Acid Hybridization/mt [Methods], Research, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, RNA,Neoplasm/ge [Genetics], Survival, Universities, X-Rays	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the gene expression changes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells after carbon ion irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three OSCC cell lines (HSC2, Ca9-22, and HSC3) were irradiated with accelerated carbon ion beams or X-rays using three different doses. The cellular sensitivities were determined by clonogenic survival assay. To identify genes the expression of which is influenced by carbon ion irradiation in a dose-dependent manner, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip analysis with HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays containing 54,675 probe sets. The identified genes were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool to investigate the functional network and gene ontology. Changes in mRNA expression in the genes were assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We identified 98 genes with expression levels that were altered significantly at least twofold in each of the three carbon-irradiated OSCC cell lines at all dose points compared with nonirradiated control cells. Among these, SPHK1, the expression of which was significantly upregulated by carbon ion irradiation, was modulated little by X-rays. The function of SPHK1 related to cellular growth and proliferation had the highest p value (p = 9.25e-7 to 2.19e-2). Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed significantly elevated SPHK1 expression levels after carbon ion irradiation (p < 0.05), consistent with microarray data. Clonogenic survival assay indicated that carbon ion irradiation could induce cell death in Ca9-22 cells more effectively than X-rays. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SPHK1 helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and processes underlying the biologic response to carbon ion beams in OSCC	
2747	Modelling of DNA breaks and the formation of chromosome aberrations	Chromosome Aberrations, DNA, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Interphase, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Models,Genetic, Monte Carlo Method, Research	We present results of some calculations that convert double-strand breaks to dicentrics by means of a repair-misrepair model. The method uses Monte Carlo techniques to determine the positions of the double-strand breaks and to determine the dicentric yields for comparison with those obtained experimentally in human lymphocytes following irradiation in G0. The model is able to describe the linear-quadratic curves of dicentric yield following low LET irradiation, but underpredicts by a factor of about 1.5-2.0 the high LET neutron curves. The effects of including corrections for interphase death are demonstrated. The reasons for the discrepancy at high LET are discussed and suggestions for an improvement to the fit are made	
3989	Various wedge isodose angles for treatment planning	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Universities	Various wedge isodose angles or simply wedge angles smaller than the nominal wedge angle were created by combining the isodose distributions generated from a single physical wedge with the isodose distributions of the open field for the 8-MV photon beam. The particular wedge angle generated depends on the weights imposed on these isodose distributions. The relationship between these weights and the wedge angle were examined and found to be nonlinear. The difference between the wedge angles defined at 10 cm depth and those defined using the 50% isodose curve is less 6 degrees. The present data was fitted using two proposed empirical equations	
1026	Proton therapy of uveal melanomas in Berlin. 5 years of experience at the Hahn-Meitner Institute.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Berlin, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Eye Diseases/et [Etiology], Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Glaucoma/et [Etiology], Humans, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Time, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In June 1998, proton-beam therapy of ocular tumors started at the Hahn-Meitner Institute Berlin, Germany. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Proton-beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn-Meitner Institute after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved	
1325	Biological imaging of heavy charged-particle tracks	Bismuth, Carbon, Cells,Cultured, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, Cyclins/an [Analysis], DNA Damage, DNA-Binding Proteins, DNA-Binding Proteins/an [Analysis], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Fluorescence, Germany, Heavy Ions, Histones/me [Metabolism], Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Ions, Lead, Linear Energy Transfer, Movement, Phosphorylation, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/an [Analysis]	The immunocytochemical response to DNA damage induced by low-energy bismuth and carbon ions was investigated in normal human fibroblasts. Inside the nuclei, the traversing charged particles lead to the accumulation of proteins related to DNA lesions and repair along the ion trajectories. Irradiation under a standard geometric setup with the beam direction perpendicular to the cell monolayer generates spots of these proteins as described previously for MRE11B (hMre11), CDKN1A (p21) and PCNA (Jakob et al., Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 78, 75-88, 2002). Here we present data obtained with a new irradiation geometry characterized by a small angle between the beam direction and the monolayer of cells. This new irradiation geometry leads to the formation of protein aggregates in the shape of streaks stretching over several micrometers in the x/y plane, thus facilitating the analysis of the fluorescence distributions along the particle trajectories. Measurements of fluorescence intensity along the ion tracks in double- and triple-stained samples revealed a strict spatial correlation for the occurrence of CDKN1A and MRE11B clusters. In addition, immunostained gamma-H2AX is used as a marker of double-strand breaks (DSBs) to visualize the localized induction of these lesions along the particle paths. A clear coincidence of CDKN1A and gamma-H2AX signals within the ion-induced streaks is observed. Also for PCNA, which mainly associates with lesions processed by excision repair, a strict colocalization with the MRE11B aggregations was found along the ion trajectories, despite the higher estimated yield of this type of lesions compared to DSBs. Strikingly similar patterns of protein clusters are generated not only for the various proteins studied but also using different ion species from carbon to bismuth, covering LET values ranging from about 300 to 13600 keV/microm and producing estimated DSB densities differing by a factor around 45. The patterns of protein clustering along the very heavy-ion trajectories appear far more heterogeneous than expected based on idealized DSB distributions arising from model calculations. The results suggest that additional factors like compaction or confined movement of chromatin are responsible for the observed clustering of proteins	
4708	Increases in 1H-NMR mobile lipids are not always associated with overt apoptosis: evidence from MG-63 human osteosarcoma three-dimensional spheroids exposed to a low dose (2 Gy) of ionizing radiation	Apoptosis, Apoptosis/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Death, Cell Line,Tumor, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], DNA, DNA Fragmentation, Gene Expression Regulation,Neoplastic/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Italy, Lipid Metabolism/re [Radiation Effects], Lipids, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Osteosarcoma/me [Metabolism], Osteosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiotherapy, Research, Spheroids,Cellular/me [Metabolism], Spheroids,Cellular/pa [Pathology], Spheroids,Cellular/re [Radiation Effects]	The metabolic changes that occur in MG-63 osteosarcoma three-dimensional tumor spheroids exposed to 2 Gy of ionizing radiation, a dose that is comparable to radiation therapy, were studied using high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, the (1)H-NMR spectra of control and exposed MG-63 spheroids were compared. Small spheroids (about 50-80 microm in diameter) with no hypoxic center were used. The spectra of whole MG-63 spheroids as well as the perchloric acid extracts of these systems were evaluated. Cell damage was also examined by lactate dehydrogenase release and changes in cell growth. No cell damage was observed, but numerous metabolic changes took place in spheroids after exposure to ionizing radiation. In particular, significant increases in both CH(2) and CH(3) mobile lipids, considered by many authors as markers of apoptosis and also present in MG-63 spheroids undergoing overt apoptosis, were observed in spheroids irradiated with 2 Gy. However, the chromatin dye Hoechst 33258 and DNA fragmentation assays showed no overt apoptosis up to 7 days after irradiation with this low dose. Thus it is evident that increases in mobile lipids do not always indicate actual cell death. A detailed analysis of the other metabolic changes observed appears to suggest that the cell death program was initiated but not completed. In fact, the completely different behavior of two important cellular defense mechanisms, reduced glutathione and taurine, in spheroids irradiated with 2 Gy and in those undergoing overt apoptosis seems to indicate that these systems are protecting spheroids from actual cell death. In addition, these data also suggest that (1)H-NMR can be used to examine the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation in spheroids, a cell model of great complexity that closely resembles tumors in vivo. The importance of this possibility in relation to reaching the ultimate goal of a better evaluation of the outcome of radiotherapy protocols should not be ignored	
4567	Improving IMRT quality control efficiency using an amorphous silicon electronic portal imager	Calibration, Efficiency, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Signal Processing,Computer-Assisted, Silicon, Time Factors	An amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID) has been investigated to determine its usefulness and efficiency for performing linear accelerator quality control checks specific to step and shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Several dosimetric parameters were measured using the EPID: dose linearity and segment to segment reproducibility of low dose segments, and delivery accuracy of fractions of monitor units. Results were compared to ion chamber measurements. Low dose beam flatness and symmetry were tested by overlaying low dose beam profiles onto the profile from a stable high-dose exposure and visually checking for differences. Beam flatness and symmetry were also calculated and plotted against dose. Start-up reproducibility was tested by overlaying profiles from twenty successive two monitor unit segments. A method for checking the MLC leaf calibration was also tested, designed to be used on a daily or weekly basis, which consisted of summing the images from a series of matched fields. Daily images were coregistered with, then subtracted from, a reference image. A threshold image showing dose differences corresponding to > 0.5 mm positional errors was generated and the number of pixels with such dose differences used as numerical parameter to which a tolerance can be applied. The EPID was found to be a sensitive relative dosemeter, able to resolve dose differences of 0.01 cGy. However, at low absolute doses a reproducible dosimetric nonlinearity of up to 7% due to image lag/ghosting effects was measured. It was concluded that although the EPID is suitable to measure segment to segment reproducibility and fractional monitor unit delivery accuracy, it is still less useful than an ion chamber as a tool for dosimetric checks. The symmetry/flatness test proved to be an efficient method of checking low dose profiles, much faster than any of the alternative methods. The MLC test was found to be extremely sensitive to sudden changes in MLC calibration but works best with a composite reference image consisting of an average of five successive days' images. When used in this way it proved an effective and efficient daily check of MLC calibration. Overall, the amorphous silicon EPID was found to be a suitable device for IMRT QC although it is not recommended for dosimetric tests. Automatic procedures for low monitor unit profile analysis and MLC leaf positioning yield considerable time-savings over traditional film techniques	
1477	Microbeams, microdosimetry and specific dose	Alpha Particles, Humans, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Sensitivity and Specificity, Tissue Distribution	Dose and its usefulness as a single parameter to describe the amount of radiation absorbed are well established for most situations. The conditions where the concept of dose starts to break down are well known, mostly from the study of microdosimetry. For low doses of high LET radiation it is noted that the process of taking the limiting value of the energy absorbed within a test volume divided by the mass within that volume yields either zero or a relatively large value. The problem is further exacerbated with microbeam irradiations where the uniformity of the energy deposition is experimentally manipulated on the spatial scale of cells being irradiated. Booz introduced a quantity to deal with these problems: the unfortunately named 'mean specific energy in affected volumes'. This quantity multiplied by the probability that a test volume has received an energy deposit is equal to dose (in situations where dose can be defined). I propose that Booz's quantity be renamed 'specific dose', that is the mean energy deposited divided by the mass within a specified volume. If we believe for instance that the nucleus of a cell is the critical volume for biological effects, we can refer to the nuclear specific dose. A microbeam experiment wherein 10 per cent of the cell nuclei were targeted with 10 alpha particles would be described as delivering a nuclear specific dose of 1.6 Gy to 10 per cent of the population	
269	Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon ion radiotherapy for malignant gliomas: combined X-ray radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and carbon ion radiotherapy	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Astrocytoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Astrocytoma/mo [Mortality], Astrocytoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Combined Modality Therapy/mt [Methods], Female, Glioblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioma/dt [Drug Therapy], Glioma/mo [Mortality], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nimustine/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To report the results of a Phase I/II clinical trial for patients with malignant gliomas, treated with combined X-ray radiotherapy (XRT), chemotherapy, and carbon ion radiotherapy (CRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1994 and February 2002, 48 patients with histologically confirmed malignant gliomas (16 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 32 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical study. The treatment involved the application of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks of XRT, followed by CRT at 8 fractions/2 weeks. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) were administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) concurrently in weeks 1, 4, or 5 of XRT. The carbon ion dose was increased from 16.8 to 24.8 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 10% incremental steps (16.8, 18.4, 20.0, 22.4, and 24.8 GyE, respectively). RESULTS: There was no Grade 3 or higher acute reaction in the brain. The late reactions included four cases of Grade 2 brain morbidity and four cases of Grade 2 brain reaction among 48 cases. The median survival time (MST) of AA patients was 35 months and that of GBM patients 17 months (p = 0.0035). The median progression-free survival and MST of GBM showed 4 and 7 months for the low-dose group, 7 and 19 months for the middle-dose group, and 14 and 26 months for the high-dose group. CONCLUSION: The results of combined therapy using XRT, ACNU chemotherapy, and CRT showed the potential efficacy of CRT for malignant gliomas in terms of the improved survival rate in those patients who received higher carbon doses	
2925	A comparison of techniques for stereotactic radiotherapy by linear accelerator based on 3-dimensional dose distributions. [Review] [23 refs]	Head, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Research, Rotation, Technology,Radiologic	In order to establish the appropriate beam arrangement for use in stereotactic radiotherapy using a linear accelerator, dose volume distributions were calculated for a number of spherical targets in a head phantom and assessment was made by dose sparing of normal tissue outside the target volume. Using a single isocentre, fixed beam arrangements were compared with single and multiple non-coplanar isocentric arc rotations at target sizes from 10 to 55 mm diameter on a 6 MV Philips linear accelerator. From the dose-volume histograms produced, an arrangement of 3 or 4 arcs of rotation proved most suitable, in terms of sparing of normal tissue outside the target volume to high dose irradiation, across the range of target sizes studied. There was little further benefit with increasing the number of arcs beyond this. At target sizes greater than 20 mm diameter an arrangement of 6 static non-coplanar beams achieved sparing equivalent to multiple arc rotations and may have considerable advantages in the treatment of irregular volumes where customised beam shaping could be employed.

184	Pilot evaluation of cytokine levels in patients undergoing radiotherapy for brain tumor	Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cytokines/bl [Blood], Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Female, Growth Substances/bl [Blood], Humans, Interleukin-1/bl [Blood], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Pilot Projects, Radiotherapy, Research, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/me [Metabolism]	This study was undertaken to evaluate plasma levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 3 pediatric and 14 adult patients receiving radiotherapy for brain tumor. Patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, schwannoma, and lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the brain were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after treatment with conventional photon and/or proton radiation; samples from healthy volunteers served as controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantitate the cytokines. Before irradiation, most patients had greater amounts of one or more of the cytokines compared with the mean obtained for control plasma. This was especially striking in patients with chondrosarcoma; the mean values for TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, bFGF, and EGF were 1458, 1289, 332, and 92% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. After irradiation, bFGF and total TGF-beta 1 decreased in the majority of tested subjects. In contrast, IL-1 beta was detected only in pediatric patients (all with astrocytoma) and its levels after radiation were 33 to 67% higher than at pretreatment. EGF was found in four patients; post-treatment values were 125 to 608% higher in three of the individuals. These data show that cytokines are present at elevated concentrations in the blood circulation of patients with certain types of brain tumors and that changes in their levels can be detected after radiotherapy. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether these findings contribute to morbidity or therapeutic outcome

Mode of action and problems are discussed and published results reported. Human tumour cells obtained of biopsies from our patients before the onset of treatments were investigated. The short time cell cultures were treated either with hyperthermia or irradiation alone or with combinations under the same conditions as the clinical treatments. We could clearly demonstrate that cell cultures of human origin respond to irradiation or hyperthermia. But the effect was limited and only cultures treated with combined modalities did not relapse. There is hope that mega-voltage radiation complemented with hyperthermia have a similar effect as high-LET-radiation. Side effects have been moderate so far using an extended clinical use	
4617	Radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: from palliation to cure. [Review] [85 refs]	Canada, Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/th [Therapy], Chemoembolization,Therapeutic, Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Ontario, Pain, Palliative Care, Patients, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Societies, Survival, Universities	Technologic advances have provided the means to deliver tumoricidal doses of radiation therapy (RT) to patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) while avoiding critical normal tissues, providing the opportunity to use RT for curative intent treatment of HCC. For the current report, the expanded role of external beam RT in the setting of HCC from palliation to cure was reviewed. A systematic literature search was undertaken using the MEDLINE data base and secondary references to identify peer-reviewed, English-language articles that reported clinical outcomes after external beam RT alone or in combination with other treatments for HCC. Abstracts from the 2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, American Gastrointestinal Association, and Society of Surgical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium also were included in the search. More than 60 articles reporting on clinical outcomes among patients who received RT for HCC have been published since 1990, including 20 articles that described unique sets of at least 15 patients. RT was used for palliation, to improve local control, and with curative intent in a wide spectrum of patients who most often were unsuitable for surgery and other treatments. Pain reduction following RT was noted in approximately 75% of patients with bone metastases from HCC who received RT. For patients with liver-confined disease treated with conformal RT, proton beam RT, and/or image guided RT with or without transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), local control response rates ranged from 40% to 90%, and the median survival ranges from 10 months to 25 months. For patients with HCC who had portal vein thrombus, the median survival after RT to treat the thrombus and/or the hepatic tumor with or without TACE ranged from 5.3 months to 9.7 months. Although outcomes after high-dose conformal RT for liver-confined HCC were excellent, the potential survival benefit of RT should be tested in randomized controlled trials that require international collaboration. 2006 American Cancer Society [References: 85]	
335	In vivo EBT radiochromic film dosimetry of electron beam for Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET)	Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Film Dosimetry, Humans, Italy, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skin Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	EBT radiochromic films were used to determine skin-dose maps for patients undergone Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET). Gafchromic EBT radiochromic film is one of the newest radiation-induced auto-developing photon and electron-beam analysis films available for therapeutic radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy applications. EBT films can be particularly useful in TSET; due to patient morphology, underdosed regions typically occur, and the radiochromic film represents a suitable candidate for monitoring them. In this study, TSET was applied to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The technique for TSET was implemented by using an electron beam with a nominal energy of 6MeV. The patient was treated in a standing position using dual angled fields in order to obtain the greatest dose uniformity along the patient's longitudinal axis. The electron beam energy was degraded by a PMMA filter. The in vivo dose distribution was determined through the use of EBT films, as well as of thermoluminescent dosimeters for comparison (TLDs). EBT results showed a reasonable agreement with TLDs data	
556	Accelerated partial-breast irradiation using proton beams: initial clinical experience	Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/px [Psychology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast/pa [Pathology], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Esthetics, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Massachusetts, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Patient Satisfaction, Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Telangiectasis/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: We present our initial clinical experience with proton, three-dimensional, conformal, external beam, partial-breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance	
2290	Is the syndrome of pathological laughing and crying a manifestation of pseudobulbar palsy?	Adult, Boston, Crying, Crying/ph [Physiology], Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Laughter, Laughter/ph [Physiology], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Paralysis/et [Etiology], Pons/bs [Blood Supply], Syndrome, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A case of angiographically occult brainstem vascular malformation presenting solely with pathological laughing and crying is reported. Although this emotional syndrome has been seen in association with several different pathological entities, review of the literature failed to identify its occurrence as the only clinical expression of angiographically occult brainstem vascular malformation, or as a solitary symptom in any disease. Our data suggest that pathological laughing and crying can occur without any other manifestation of pseudobulbar palsy. An attempt is made to correlate this patient's clinical and radiological findings. This case was treated by stereotactic Bragg-peak proton beam therapy	
2922	The time course of irradiation changes in proton beam-treated uveal melanomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Autopsy, Boston, Cyclotrons, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Fibrosis, Humans, Inflammation, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Prevalence, Protons, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveitis/et [Etiology], Uveitis/pa [Pathology]	BACKGROUND: Although histopathologic changes in uveal melanomas treated by irradiation have been well characterized, the timing of these effects after irradiation has not been previously evaluated. METHODS: The series consisted of a total of 92 eyes with uveal melanoma, enucleated at various intervals after proton irradiation (range, 1 month to 8 years) due to complications (n = 66) or tumor growth (n = 22), or at autopsy (n = 4). Study slides were read, using a standard protocol, by two pathologists masked to the timing of the enucleation after irradiation and the reason for the surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of inflammation decreased whereas fibrosis increased with time from 15% of cases enucleated within 12 months (early cases) to 61% of those enucleated more than 30 months (late cases) after irradiation (P for trend = 0.0005). Tumor necrosis and blood vessel damage occurred early, and the prevalence of these changes was constant over time. Excluding tumors with evidence of growth after irradiation, mitotic figures became progressively less common as the interval between irradiation and enucleation increased (P for trend = 0.015); no mitotic figures were present in 40 high-power fields more than 30 months after irradiation. CONCLUSION: Histopathologic changes in irradiated melanomas vary according to the time elapsed since irradiation. Inflammation decreases with time whereas fibrosis becomes more prevalent with time after irradiation. Among controlled tumors, mitotic figures appear only in recently irradiated tumors

Irradiation was performed with 6 and 25 MV X-rays from a linear accelerator. For measurements, films and ionization chambers have been chosen. The comparison between calculations and measurements shows some discrepancies at the level of junctions and also in areas of low doses especially when many segments were used. These theoretical cases provide a first step on the way towards treatments with intensity modulation

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone	
1193	Dependence of fluence errors in dynamic IMRT on leaf-positional errors varying with time and leaf number	Boston, Humans, Lead, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Models,Theoretical, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Normal Distribution, Particle Accelerators, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Time, Women	In d-MLC based IMRT, leaves move along a trajectory that lies within a user-defined tolerance (TOL) about the ideal trajectory specified in a d-MLC sequence file. The MLC controller measures leaf positions multiple times per second and corrects them if they deviate from ideal positions by a value greater than TOL. The magnitude of leaf-positional errors resulting from finite mechanical precision depends on the performance of the MLC motors executing leaf motions and is generally larger if leaves are forced to move at higher speeds. The maximum value of leaf-positional errors can be limited by decreasing TOL. However, due to the inherent time delay in the MLC controller, this may not happen at all times. Furthermore, decreasing the leaf tolerance results in a larger number of beam hold-offs, which, in turn leads, to a longer delivery time and, paradoxically, to higher chances of leaf-positional errors (< or = TOL). On the other end, the magnitude of leaf-positional errors depends on the complexity of the fluence map to be delivered. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to determine the actual distribution of leaf-positional errors either by the imaging of moving MLC apertures with a digital imager or by analysis of a MLC log file saved by a MLC controller. This leads next to an important question: What is the relation between the distribution of leaf-positional errors and fluence errors. In this work, we introduce an analytical method to determine this relation in dynamic IMRT delivery. We model MLC errors as Random-Leaf Positional (RLP) errors described by a truncated normal distribution defined by two characteristic parameters: a standard deviation sigma and a cut-off value deltax0 (deltaxo approximately TOL). We quantify fluence errors for two cases: (i) deltax0 >> sigma (unrestricted normal distribution) and (ii) deltax0 << sigma (deltax0--limited normal distribution). We show that an average fluence error of an IMRT field is proportional to (i) sigma/ALPO and (ii) deltax0/ALPO, respectively, where ALPO is an Average Leaf Pair Opening (the concept of ALPO was previously introduced by us in Med. Phys. 28, 2220-2226 (2001). Therefore, dose errors associated with RLP errors are larger for fields requiring small leaf gaps. For an N-field IMRT plan, we demonstrate that the total fluence error (if we neglect inhomogeneities and scatter) is proportional to 1/square root of N, where N is the number of fields, which slightly reduces the impact of RLP errors of individual fields on the total fluence error. We tested and applied the analytical apparatus in the context of commercial inverse treatment planning systems used in our clinics (Helios and BrainScan). We determined the actual distribution of leaf-positional errors by studying MLC controller (Varian Mark II and Brainlab Novalis MLCs) log files created by the controller after each field delivery. The analytically derived relationship between fluence error and RLP errors was confirmed by numerical simulations. The equivalence of relative fluence error to relative dose error was verified by a direct dose calculation. We also experimentally verified the truthfulness of fluences derived from the log file data by comparing them to film data	
52	Effectiveness of protons and argon ions in initiating lipid peroxidation in low-density lipoproteins.[see comment]	Argon/ch [Chemistry], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrophoresis,Polyacrylamide Gel, Erythrocyte Membrane/me [Metabolism], Germany, Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Lipid Peroxidation, Lipoproteins,LDL/me [Metabolism], Protons, Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances	In this study, human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) vesicles were irradiated with 73 MeV protons (LET of 1 keV/microm) and 11.4 MeV/nucleon argon ions (LET of 1.52 MeV/pm) and the effectiveness of charged particles in initiating peroxidation of LDLs was investigated. The LDL suspension (6 g/l) was exposed to protons and to argon ions in a dose range of 24 Gy to 2.4 kGy. Irradiations were carried out at the synchrocyclotron at the CPO and at the UNILAC of the GSI. After irradiation three chemical assays were used to study the progression of peroxidation of LDLs: the formation of conjugated dienes, the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and the increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDLs. The results were compared with those obtained after gamma irradiation. For protons the yields of the peroxidation products were 10 times lower than after gamma irradiation. However, for doses below 200 Gy, protons appeared to be more effective than gamma rays in damaging the protein moiety, as deduced from the observed increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDLs. The irradiation with argon ions led to a negligible formation of peroxidation products, but an increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDLs was observed. The results are indicative of a lower yield of lipid peroxidation after irradiation with high-LET particles. In contrast, protons and argon ions appear to be more effective in inducing bulk protein and phospholipid damage than gamma rays	
826	Radiotherapy for local control of osteosarcoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Bone Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Bone Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Child, Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Osteosarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Osteosarcoma/su [Surgery], Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Local control of osteosarcoma in patients for whom a resection with satisfactory margins is not achieved can be difficult. This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05). No definitive dose-response relationship for local control of tumor was seen, although the local control rate was 71% +/- 9% for 32 patients receiving doses > or =55 Gy vs. 53.6% +/- 20.1% for 9 patients receiving <55 Gy (p = 0.11). Of 15 patients with tumors >5.3 cm, 9 received doses > or =55 Gy and the local control rate was 80% +/- 17.9%, and 6 received doses <55 Gy with a local control rate of only 50% +/- 25% at 5 years (p = 0.16). Among patients who underwent gross total resection, the local control rate was 77.5% +/- 9.95% in 22 patients with negative margins vs 66.7% +/- 27.2% in 3 patients with positive margins (p = 0.54). Two patients had unknown margin status. CONCLUSION: RT can help provide local control of osteosarcoma for patients in whom surgical resection with widely, negative margins is not possible. It appears to be more effective in situations in which microscopic or minimal residual disease is being treated

Since January 1991 we treated 3 retinoblastomas with proton beam at the cyclotron of Louvain-la-Neuve. Results are encouraging. The short term outcome seems comparable to phototherapy, but the long term expectancy is better, because of reduced secondary malignancies. Proton beam treatment for selected retinoblastomas seems a good alternative to external radiotherapy	
2194	Effects of 16O+6 ion irradiation on human sperm spontaneous chemiluminescence, motility, acrosome reaction and viability in vitro	Acrosome Reaction/re [Radiation Effects], Chemiluminescent Measurements, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Heavy Ions, Humans, Male, Oxygen, Physics, Research, Sperm Motility/re [Radiation Effects], Spermatozoa/ph [Physiology], Spermatozoa/re [Radiation Effects]	Effects of 16O+6 ion irradiation with different doses on human sperm spontaneous chemiluminescence (SCL), motility, acrosome reaction (AR) and viability were examined. Spermatozoa were irradiated with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 Gy 16O+6 ion beam at the energy of 3.17 MeV/u. After irradiation, samples were analyzed by SCL measurement at 1, 2 and 3 h of incubation; motility was determined by the transmembrane migration method within 2 h of incubation; the percentage of AR and viability was evaluated by the triple-stain technique at 3.5 h of incubation. The results showed: sperm SCL was significantly increased with irradiation doses and the lowest effective dose was 0.5 Gy; compared with controls, the transmembrane migration ratio of spermatozoa progressively elevated with irradiation doses at 0.5, 1, and 2 Gy; the percentage of sperm AR markedly increased in 0.5-4 Gy irradiation and the optimal dose was 2 Gy, and then significant decreased with further increase of irradiation doses; the viability had no significant change within 0.25-8 Gy, but was progressively decreased at 16, 32 and 64 Gy. These data suggested that heavy ion at low doses increased motility and AR, whereas had deleterious effects at higher doses, which are associated with free radical reactions induced by heavy ion irradiation	
673	Differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence after gamma knife radiosurgery for brain metastases: importance of multi-voxel proton MRS	Abnormalities,Radiation-Induced/di [Diagnosis], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/sc [Secondary], Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research	Comparative analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET, single-voxel, and multi-voxel proton MRS for differentiation between radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence was done in 9 patients with brain metastases treated by gamma knife radiosurgery. In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

Treatment by an experienced multidisciplinary team offers the best chance of achieving permanent tumor control. Histopathologically-free resection margins are of the greatest importance. The indication for radiotherapy is determined by the recurrence risk profile of the individual patient. In addition to the well-proven postoperative irradiation, neoadjuvant radiotherapy is also successful. In the event of an unfavorably sited tumor, intra-operative irradiation can be applied in combination with either form. Patients with large G3 tumors can be given adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of distant metastases. On account of its appreciable toxicity, however, it should be reserved for patients younger than 65 in a good state of health. [References: 0]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The linac head was designed to move along the C-arm with a maximum angle of 60 degrees (from a vertical position toward the gantry). Simultaneous rotation of the gantry creates a dynamic conical irradiation technique. Dynamic conical conformal radiation therapy (Dyconic CRT) was developed by combining the technique with continuous motion of a multileaf collimator. Dose distributions were measured in phantoms using film densitometry and compared with conventional RCRT. Dose distributions in actual radiation therapy patients are also presented. RESULTS: Dyconic CRT enabled the precise delivery of noncoplanar beams without rotating the table. The measurements showed that three-dimensionally isotropic dose falloff was achieved with Dyconic CRT. Dose inhomogeneity in the sagittal direction with Dyconic CRT was compensated for by use of wedge filters. CONCLUSIONS: The drawbacks of the dose distributions produced by RCRT were overcome with the use of Dyconic CRT

Over 150 patients have been irradiated with heavy charged particle beams including helium, carbon, neon, and argon ions. Pilot studies have included such tumor sites as glioma of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the pancreas, carcinoma of the stomach, ocular melanoma, and carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Prospective studies are planned to investigate the improved dose localization potential (helium) and the enhanced biologic and physical dose potential (carbon, neon) in a controlled trial against the best available megavoltage irradiation techniques

Feasibility and initial results	Aged, Feasibility Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Mesothelioma/mo [Mortality], Mesothelioma/ra [Radiography], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Pleural Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pleural Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pleural Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiography,Thoracic, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Software, Survival, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complex-shaped malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) with challenging volumes are extremely difficult to treat by conventional radiotherapy due to tolerance doses of the surrounding normal tissue. In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT

The coordinates of specific target landmarks, i.e., bone, calcium deposition or catheters, on baseline CT scans were compared with those measured on control scans. Since the PLATO-SRS system yields 3 coordinates for each target, the final error is calculated by the evaluation of the shift of the different coordinates. The mean error reported for the first material (ORFIT) was 5 mm (13/23 patients). This margin of error is too high and was considered unacceptable; a second material was then tested. The latter, which is not recyclable and softens at higher temperatures, exhibited a mean error of 2.5 mm (10/23 patients), which allows daily repositioning of greater reliability. Treatment was repeated in 4/20 arcs in all, which number depended mainly on fraction size. Correct lesion location and patient positioning were allowed by laser landmarks on the mask made directly on the treatment couch. The laser too was checked before each treatment session, i.e., preferentially at the end of an ordinary working day	
2858	The effect of space radiation of the nervous system. [Review] [26 refs]	Abnormalities,Radiation-Induced, Adult, Aging, Animals, Blood-Brain Barrier/re [Radiation Effects], Brain, Brain/bs [Blood Supply], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], California, Californium, Capillaries/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Death, Cell Division, Cell Membrane/re [Radiation Effects], Cosmic Radiation, DNA, DNA Repair, Embryonic and Fetal Development/re [Radiation Effects], Energy Transfer, Eye/re [Radiation Effects], Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Iron, Microcirculation, Neurons/re [Radiation Effects], Radiation, Research, Universities, Visual Perception	The long-term effects of irradiation by accelerated heavy ions on the structure and function of the nervous system have not been studied extensively. Although the adult brain is relatively resistant to low LET radiation, cellular studies indicate that individual heavy ions can produce serious membrane lesions and multiple chromatin breaks. Capillary hemorrhages may follow high LET particle irradiation of the developing brain as high RBE effects. Evidence has been accumulating that the glial system and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are relatively sensitive to injury by ionizing radiation. While DNA repair is active in neural systems, it may be assumed that a significant portion of this molecular process is misrepair. Since the expression of cell lethality usually requires cell division, and nerve cells have an extremely low rate of division, it is possible that some of the characteristic changes of premature aging may represent a delayed effect of chromatin misrepair in brain. Altered microcirculation, decreased local metabolism, entanglement and reduction in synaptic density, premature loss of neurons, myelin degeneration, and glial proliferation are late signs of such injuries. HZE particles are very efficient in producing carcinogenic cell transformation, reaching a peak for iron particles. The promotion of viral transformation is also efficient up to an energy transfer of approximately 300 keV/micron. The RBE for carcinogenesis in nerve tissues remains unknown. On the basis of available information concerning HZE particle flux in interplanetary space, only general estimates of the magnitude of the effects of long-term spaceflight on some nervous system parameters may be constructed.

1716	Importance of cell proliferative state and potentially lethal damage repair on radiation effectiveness: implications for combined tumor treatments (review). [Review] [87 refs]	Animals, Cell Division/ge [Genetics], Cell Division/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Proliferation, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Kinetics, Models,Biological, Neoplasms/ge [Genetics], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Netherlands, Radiation, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radiotherapy	The dependence of parameters of the linear-quadratic (LQ) model on cell proliferation kinetics of tumors in relation to potentially lethal damage (PLD) and its repair is evaluated. The influence of sensitizing agents on these parameters during fractionated radiotherapy is assessed. Suggestions for scheduling of radiation combined of with sensitizing agents are derived. The parameters alpha and beta of the linear-quadratic model for dose dependence of cell reproductive inactivation, derived from experimental and clinical data, are evaluated to assess their dependence on cell proliferative state, on PLD repair and on the action of various sensitizing agents. PLD contributes to the linear as well as to the quadratic component of the LQ model. PLD is less effectively repaired in proliferating (P) cells than in clonogenic (G0) cells of the quiescent (Q) cell compartment. PLD is influenced by various agents applied during, as well as after irradiation. The parameters alpha and beta are affected differently by the proliferative state of cells, by some of the sensitizing agents, and by radiation quality. The relative fractions of P cells and Q cells can change during fractionated treatments. If recruitment is effective, the fraction of G0 cells decreases in the latter part of a treatment schedule. PLD from subsequent radiation doses is then repaired less and the effectiveness of radiation combined with sensitizing agents may be enhanced. The analyses using the LQ model show differences in PLD and its repair between P cells and G0 cells in tumors. If due to recruitment the compartment of clonogenic G0 cells diminishes during treatment, the combination of radiation with sensitizing agents and the application of high-LET radiation should be scheduled to take this factor into account. For poorly differentiated tumors with high labeling indices (LI), benefit from combined treatments is expected from early in the course of fractionated radiotherapy. Well differentiated tumors with low LI are suggested to benefit most from irradiation combined with sensitizing agents in the latter part of a treatment schedule. New methods are required to assess the clonogenic G0 cells in the Q cell compartment and to monitor recruitment of these cells into the P cell compartment. [References: 87]

Single target cells in the path of the tracks might be damaged by even low-dose alpha-irradiation. We found non-clonal cytogenetic aberrations, characterised by a high frequency of chromatid aberrations with chromosome aberrations, in clonal descendants of haemopoietic stem cells after exposure to alpha-particles of bone marrow cells from two of four haematologically normal individuals (up to 25% abnormal metaphases). The data are consistent with a transmissible genetic instability induced in a stem cell resulting in a diversity of aberrations in its clonal progeny many cell divisions later	
2586	Neutron irradiation of human pelvic tissues yields a steep dose-response function for late sequelae.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Pelvis, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	PURPOSE: Analysis of the dose-response function in normal tissues following pelvic irradiation for carcinoma of the prostate. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A homogeneous group of 136 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate were treated with the Fermilab high-energy neutron beam at three dose levels: 19, 20.4, and 21 Gy, using the same treatment plan and fractionation scheme for all patients. RESULTS: Tumor control rates were about 83% at the three dose levels studied. However, the normal tissue complication rate (late sequelae) varied with dose: 0 out of 5 at 19 Gy, 5 out of 58 (8.6%) at 20.4 Gy, and 9 out of 73 (12.3%) at 21 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron therapy to the pelvis reveals a steep dose-response function for late effects with a coefficient of variation of only 11%. This is lower than that usually observed with photons or with less uniform clinical data sets, and may be characteristic for well-planned high-LET radiotherapy

Three of these patients had refused to take corticosteroids and the other 11 had failed to respond to them, had experienced side effects, or had other contraindications to their use. After follow-up periods ranging from six months to three years, soft-tissue inflammation was reduced in 13 of the 14 patients. All but two patients showed a decrease in proptosis of 1 to 3 mm. Myopathy showed the least improvement. Although we noted transient eyelid erythema, there were no permanent sequelae and none of the patients has had a recurrence of the inflammation	
1995	Determination of effective electron source size using multislit and pinhole cameras	Aluminum, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Lead, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Scattering,Radiation	Two independent methods have been utilized for determination of effective source sizes for 6, 12, and 20 MeV electron beams generated by a Varian 2100C linear accelerator. First, a multislit camera has been constructed using parallel aluminum plates and plastic strip spacers, similar to the beam-spot camera for the photon source imaging. Second, pinhole imaging was performed using a lead plate with a small hole on the central axis of the beam. The plate thickness and the hole diameter varied with electron energy. The cameras were positioned directly at the opening of the movable photon collimator. The size of the source distribution from each camera was characterized by its full width at half-maximum (FWHM) value. The measured values of FWHM are different for each camera because of their different imaging principles. For the multislit camera, the measured FWHM values were (6.3 +/- 0.4) cm for the 6 MeV beam, (3.6 +/- 0.4) cm for 12 MeV, and (2.7 +/- 0.4) cm for 20 MeV. For the pinhole camera the measured values of FWHM were (7.9 +/- 0.6) cm for 6 MeV, (4.5 +/- 0.4) cm for 12 MeV, and (3.0 +/- 0.4) cm for the 20 MeV beam. Additionally, the effective source position was derived from output measurements at different values of the SSD, which were fitted to the inverse square law

The technique has been successfully used to measure the gamma, fast neutron and the boron dose rates in the mixed radiation field from a 252Cf source. The measured fast neutron and boron dose rates are in good agreement with the calculations and the measurements reported by other researchers. A systematic discrepancy is observed in the gamma dose rate measurements, with the present measurements being approximately 35% lower than those reported elsewhere

We present a case report that appears to contradict this doctrine. The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and was treated with surgical resection and postoperative proton-beam radiation therapy. Approximately 16 mo after completion of therapy, MRI demonstrated two new regions of enhancement, and an FDG-PET study was performed to further characterize these lesions. FDG-PET demonstrated an area of intense hypermetabolism, and wide surgical resection was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed reactive changes and areas of necrosis. There was no evidence of either recurrent or radiation-induced tumor

In this work, micronucleus dose-response curves for lymphocytes of normal and AT individuals, exposed in G(zero) to low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons, are compared. After gamma-irradiation, the micronucleus yields for AT lymphocytes are strongly increased compared with controls. The micronucleus dose-response curve for AT cells shows a linear dependence instead of a linear-quadratic one which is found for normal cells. After neutron irradiation, the increase in micronucleus yield above controls is less pronounced than with gamma-rays and the micronucleus dose-response curves are linear, as expected. The high increase in micronucleus yield compared with controls after gamma-irradiation further suggests the application of the micronucleus assay as a diagnostic tool for ataxia telangiectasia

The tumor areas were irradiated by fast electrons or cobalt 60 with 50 to 55 Gy, the lymph nodes received doses of 45 to 55 Gy. Local tumor control was achieved in 27 out of 28 patients irradiated immediately after surgery (96%). In case of demonstrated lymph node invasion, local control was achieved in 14 out of 19 cases (74%). The median survival was 9.6 years for patients in stage T1/2, N0, M0 and 2.5 years for patients in stage T1-4, N+, M0. The first two years following to therapy were decisive for the prognosis. Among those of our patients who developed recurrences during this period, not one could be cured in the long run. Two years after the end of therapy, the survival probability of patients without lymph node metastases becomes comparable to the survival curve of normal male population of the same age. In the treatment of penile carcinoma, a gradual proceeding depending on the stage is recommended for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. In case of lymph node metastases, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy should be taken into consideration

The technical part of this--which is reported in this paper--is a series of tests designed to check all aspects of treatment planning and delivery. The results of visits to the 13 participating centres--and repeat visits to some of these centres--are discussed. The main areas tested were as follows. The linear accelerator: mechanical, and optical, scales and indicators; radiation field size; flatness and symmetry. DOSIMETRY: output; wedge factor; beam energy; phantom measurements against a plan calculated by the centre. SIMULATOR: mechanical, optical scales and indicators. The results show these centres work within the tolerances chosen for most parameters. Flatness, wedge factor and energy were areas of weakness in some centres. This must be partly the cause of the spread of phantom measurements which, after removal of variations in output, still range from -7 to +6% between calculated and measured values

Treatment-planning techniques currently in use enable individual isocenter field shaping, three-dimensional optimization of isocenter placement (including the use of multiple isocenters), and real-time analysis of isodose distribution in three dimensions relative to specifically defined anatomic structures from MR imaging or CT data. Modified linear accelerators offer successful control of both arteriovenous malformations and benign tumors (acoustic neuromas, craniopharyngiomas, and meningiomas), with results equal to the best series reported by users of the gamma knife or heavy-particle systems. More recent work indicates that radiosurgery may play an important role in controlling recurrent pediatric malignant tumors, metastatic cerebral lesions, and even malignant astrocytomas in some patients. Improved correlation of isodose distributions with imaging data allows for sophisticated analysis of results and specific complications, ultimately enabling improved patient care using this exciting new technique	
3004	Experimental simulation of proton space radiation environments: a dosimetric perspective	Animals, Brain, Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Computer Simulation, Environment, Eye/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Models,Biological, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced, Orbit, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Research, Solar Activity, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Three-dimensional dose calculation techniques developed for radiotherapy treatment planning were used to calculate dose distributions from unidirectional, planar rotational and omnidirectional incident radiation (experimental proton beams and solar flares). The calculations predicted regions of high dose within primate heads exposed to 55-MeV protons, supporting the postulate of radiation-induced brain tumors within this population. Comparisons among predicted doses to the human head from solar flares of three different energies demonstrated differences between unidirectional and omnidirectional irradiation in the space environment. The results can be used to estimate dose distributions based on a) limited phantom measurements, or b) nonuniformly incident radiation in orbit; both situations are difficult to replicate under laboratory exposure conditions

In four cases in which detailed microscopic examinations were performed, radiation induced tumour necrosis was evident but in all four cases viable tumour cells were also observed. No abnormalities that could be attributed to radiation were observed in brain tissue free from tumour. The therapeutic results were comparable to the results achieved by other modern therapies. The results support the view that the RBE of high-energy protons is similar to that for 60Co radiation. It is suggested that a larger radiation dose, delivered by a homogeneous, well-defined proton field could possibly result in an improved therapeutic result without undue risk of injury to normal brain tissue

We compared full-scan (FS-FDK) and RS-FDK with regard to dose distribution in heavy ion treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data acquisition for RS-FDK is done using a respiratory sensing system in cine scan mode with a 256-multi-detector row CT (256-MDCT). To evaluate the accuracy of irradiation of moving tumors, dose distributions with each algorithm were compared in heavy ion treatment planning using beam parameters obtained with FS-FDK. RESULTS: Images obtained using RS-FDK did not show motion artifacts and visualized the edges of the liver and pulmonary vessels more clearly than those with FS-FDK. The iso-dose distributions for FS-FDK covered the target volume; in contrast, RS-FDK with the beam parameter of FS-FDK image provided an insufficient dose to the target and a considerable dose to normal tissues around it. CONCLUSIONS: The information provided by RS-FDK improves accuracy in the prescription of dose-to-target volume. Further, RS-FDK allows greater precision in the delivery of radiotherapy, including 4D radiation therapy

An intensity-controlled magnetic raster scanner together with a synchrotron allowing fast energy variation enable a unique method of purely active dose shaping in three dimensions. This contribution describes the necessary steps to establish a treatment planning system for this novel modality. We discuss the requirements for the physical beam model and the radiobiological model. Based on these we chose to implement a home-grown pencil beam model to describe the ion-tissue interaction and the Local Effect Model to calculate the RBE voxel-by-voxel. Given the large number of degrees of freedom biological dose optimization must be achieved by means of inverse treatment planning. All ion-related aspects are collected in our TRiP98 software. Biological dosimetry measuring cell survival in two dimensions turns out to be a good way to verify the model predictions as well as the actual irradiation procedure. We show a patient example and outline the future steps towards a dedicated clinic facility for all light ions	
4226	Complications of intraoperative radiation therapy	Adult, Aged, Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Rectum, Research	The ability to demonstrate an improvement in therapeutic ratio is critical in assessing new treatment modalities; an evaluation of treatment complications is essential for this purpose. We have studied the severe complications occurring after treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. Four groups of patients were compared: Group 1 (80 patients) had treatment with surgery alone for mobile and resectable tumors; Group 2 (23 patients) had treatment with high dose preoperative irradiation followed by surgical resection for tumors which were fixed to adjacent structures and initially unresectable for cure; Group 3 (24 patients, primary disease) and Group 4 (17 patients, locally recurrent disease) had locally advanced tumors as in Group 2 but were treated with IORT after preoperative irradiation and attempted surgical resection. All but 3 complications occurred within one year of therapy. Severe complications were seen in 16% of patients in Group 1, 35% in Group 2, 21% in Group 3 and 47% in Group 4 (32% in Groups 3 and 4 combined). There was a statistically insignificant increase (p = .10) in the complication rate in all irradiated patients (locally advanced tumors) compared to surgery alone (clinically mobile tumors). These data indicate no increase in severe complications with the use of IORT. If the ongoing studies continue to show improved local control with the use of IORT, expanded use of this modality may be warranted

No patient demonstrated tumor enlargement, and most lesions followed for more than five months have demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Heavy charged particle irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity associated with it in either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation	
832	Radiobiological aspects of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with isotropic low-energy X rays for early-stage breast cancer	Body Burden, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Computer Simulation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibrosis, Germany, Humans, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Linear Energy Transfer, Lung, Models,Biological, Organ Specificity, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiobiology/mt [Methods], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Time, Treatment Outcome, X-Ray Therapy/mt [Methods], X-Rays	The purpose of this study was to model the distribution of biological effect around a miniature isotropic X-ray source incorporating spherical applicators for single-dose or hypo-fractionated partial-breast intraoperative radiotherapy. A modification of the linear-quadratic formalism was used to calculate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 50 kV X rays as a function of dose and irradiation time for late-reacting normal tissue and tumor cells. The response was modeled as a function of distance in the tissue based on the distribution of equivalent dose and published dose-response data for pneumonitis and subcutaneous fibrosis after single-dose conventional irradiation. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of tumor cell inactivation was assessed. The RBE for late reactions approached unity at the applicator surface but increased as the absorbed dose decreased with increasing distance from the applicator surface. The ED50 for pneumonitis was estimated to be reached at a depth of 6-11 mm in the tissue and that for subcutaneous fibrosis at 3-6 mm, depending on the applicator diameter and whether the effect of recovery was included. Thus lung tissue would be spared because of the thickness of the thorax wall. The RBE for tumor cells was higher than for late-reacting tissue. The applicator diameter is an important parameter in determining the range of tumor cell control in the irradiated tumor bed

Using thermoluminescence, such controls are planned in the p(65) + Be neutron and 85 MeV proton beams produced at the cyclotron at Louvain-La-Neuve and dedicated to therapy applications. A preliminary study of the peak 3 (150 degrees C) and peak 5 (250 degrees C) response of CaF2:Tm (TLD-300) to neutron and proton beams aimed to analyse the effect of different radiation qualities on the dosimetric behaviour of the detector irradiated in phantom. To broaden the range of investigation, the study was extended to an experimental 12C heavy ion beam (95 MeV/nucleon). The peak 3 and 5 sensitivities in the neutron beam, compared to 60Co, varied little with depth. A major change of peak 5 sensitivity was observed for samples positioned under five leaves of the multi-leaf collimator. While peak 3 sensitivity was constant with depth in the unmodulated proton beam, peak 5 sensitivity increased by 15%. Near the Bragg peak, peak 3 showed the highest decrease of sensitivity. In the modulated proton beam, the sensitivity values were not significantly smaller than those measured in the unmodulated beam far from the Bragg peak region. The ratio of the heights of peak 3 and peak 5 decreased by 70% from the 60Co reference radiation to the 12C heavy-ion beam. This parameter was strongly correlated with the change of radiation quality

[Review] [9 refs]	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Neutrons, Photons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Research, Tomography,Emission-Computed	In the history of external beam radiotherapy, the trend for a better conformation as well as for a higher biological efficiency has been the driving force for the improvement of clinical results. However, these two goals had to be followed with separate types of radiation, i.e. photons and neutrons, and could not be combined. For the first time being, beams of heavy ions like carbon offer the possibility to combine both advantageous properties: better targeting and higher biological efficiency. Particle beams have an inverse depth dose profile, with a maximum dose in the deep seated tumor, a finite range, small lateral scattering, and a drastically increased biological efficiency in the tumor. These properties maximize the deletion effects on tumor cells. In addition, particle beams can be directed precisely in the limit of one or two millimeters, and can be monitored using positron emission tomography (PET) with the same precision. In the following paper the conditions are given that are necessary to translate these properties into clinical routine. [References: 9]

There was an increase of chromosomal aberrations with an increase of the dose. Furthermore the irradiation at stage G0 caused the formation of aberrations of chromosomal type, but irradiation at stage G2-aberrations of chromatid type. The increase of one-blow aberrations were of linear character at both stages	
1552	Nonvisual photoreceptors of the deep brain, pineal organs and retina. [Review] [491 refs]	Adult, Animals, Brain/me [Metabolism], Humans, Hungary, Hypothalamus, Light, Mammals, Movement, Photoreceptors/me [Metabolism], Photoreceptors/ph [Physiology], Pineal Gland/me [Metabolism], Research, Retina/me [Metabolism], Survival	The role of the nonvisual photoreception is to synchronise periodic functions of living organisms to the environmental light periods in order to help survival of various species in different biotopes. In vertebrates, the so-called deep brain (septal and hypothalamic) photoreceptors, the pineal organs (pineal- and parapineal organs, frontal- and parietal eye) and the retina (of the "lateral" eye) are involved in the light-based entrain of endogenous circadian clocks present in various organs. In humans, photoperiodicity was studied in connection with sleep disturbances in shift work, seasonal depression, and in jet-lag of transmeridional travellers. In the present review, experimental and molecular aspects are discussed, focusing on the histological and histochemical basis of the function of nonvisual photoreceptors. We also offer a view about functional changes of these photoreceptors during pre- and postnatal development as well as about its possible evolution. Our scope in some points is different from the generally accepted views on the nonvisual photoreceptive systems. The deep brain photoreceptors are hypothalamic and septal nuclei of the periventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting neuronal system. Already present in the lancelet and representing the most ancient type of vertebrate nerve cells ("protoneurons"), CSF-contacting neurons are sensory-type cells sitting in the wall of the brain ventricles that send a ciliated dendritic process into the CSF. Various opsins and other members of the phototransduction cascade have been demonstrated in telencephalic and hypothalamic groups of these neurons. In all species examined so far, deep brain photoreceptors play a role in the circadian and circannual regulation of periodic functions. Mainly called pineal "glands" in the last decades, the pineal organs actually represent a differentiated form of encephalic photoreceptors. Supposed to be intra- and extracranially outgrown groups of deep brain photoreceptors, pineal organs also contain neurons and glial elements. Extracranial pineal organs of submammalians are cone-dominated photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light, while intracranial pineal organs predominantly contain rod-like photoreceptor cells and thus scotopic light receptors. Vitamin B-based light-sensitive cryptochromes localized immunocytochemically in some pineal cells may take part in both the photoreception and the pacemaker function of the pineal organ. In spite of expressing phototransduction cascade molecules and forming outer segment-like cilia in some species, the mammalian pineal is considered by most of the authors as a light-insensitive organ. Expression of phototransduction cascade molecules, predominantly in young animals, is a photoreceptor-like characteristic of pinealocytes in higher vertebrates that may contribute to a light-percepting task in the perinatal entrainment of rhythmic functions. In adult mammals, adrenergic nerves--mediating daily fluctuation of sympathetic activity rather than retinal light information as generally supposed--may sustain circadian periodicity already entrained by light perinatally. Altogether three phases were supposed to exist in pineal entrainment of internal pacemakers: an embryological synchronization by light and in viviparous vertebrates by maternal effects (1); a light-based, postnatal entrainment (2); and in adults, a maintenance of periodicity by daily sympathetic rhythm of the hypothalamus. In addition to its visual function, the lateral eye retina performs a nonvisual task. Nonvisual retinal light perception primarily entrains genetically-determined periodicity, such as rod-cone dominance, EEG rhythms or retinomotor movements. It also influences the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the primary pacemaker of the brain. As neither rods nor cones seem to represent the nonvisual retinal photoreceptors, the presence of additional photoreceptors has been supposed. Cryptochrome 1, a photosensitive molecule identified in retinal nerve cells and in a subpopulation of retinal photoreceptors, is a good candidate for the nonvisual photoreceptor molecule as well as for a member of pacemaker molecules in the retina. When comparing various visual and nonvisual photoreceptors, transitory, "semi visual" (directional) light-perceptive cells can be detected among them, such as those in the parietal eye of reptiles. Measuring diffuse light intensity of the environment, semivisual photoreceptors also possess some directional light perceptive capacity aided by complementary lens-like structures, and screening pigment cells. Semivisual photoreception in aquatic animals may serve for identifying environmental areas of suitable illumination, or in poikilotermic terrestrial species for measuring direct solar irradiation for thermoregulation. As directional photoreceptors were identified among nonvisual light perceptive cells in the lancelet, but eyes are lacking, an early appearance of semivisual function, prior to a visual one (nonvisual --> semivisual --> visual?) in the vertebrate evolution was supposed.

The onset and expansion of central necrosis in tumor spheroids has been characterized to be a complex interaction of several mechanisms; in a number of cases, necrosis is not a consequence of hypoxia or anoxia, but emerges as secondary necrosis following an accumulation of apoptosis in spheroids. Recent therapeutically oriented studies have been directed towards novel hypoxic markers, targeted therapy, multicellular-mediated drug resistance, and heavy ion irradiation of spheroids. Research efforts should be enhanced mainly in the fields of tumor tissue modeling by heterotypic three-dimensional (3D) cultures and of apoptotic versus necrotic cell death. Based on the fundamental differences between monolayer and 3D cultures, spheroids should become mandatory test systems in therapeutic screening programs. [References: 138]

126	Number of potential patients to be treated with proton therapy in Italy	Humans, Incidence, Italy, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization]	In radiotherapy, the use of proton beams is one of the most promising approaches in order to reduce the treatment volume and, consequently, increase the total dose avoiding severe complications to the normal tissues surrounding the target. Among the new hospital-based facilities that are planned for the next future, the italian project is in an advanced stage of study. Because of the complexity and high cost of the italian centre, one of the most important information in order to establish the cost/benefit balance, is represented by the number of potential patients to be treated for the various pathologies. For this reason it is useful to define a priority scale of clinical indications and, on this basis, to estimate the yearly patient afflux to the center, taking into account the incidence and the expected new cases to be treated with protons. Indications have been divided into two categories, according to decreasing priority. Category A includes all the tumors in which the use of proton therapy has clearly demonstrated to be advantageous, being the only way to give a curative dose to the target. In Italy, the estimated number of this category of patients is 825 each year. Category B comprises a great variety of tumors characterized mainly by a local evolution, with a limited likelihood of distant spread, and therefore potentially cured if the local control can be obtained. The total number of potential patients in this category is more than 10,000	
3695	Use of spreadsheets to manipulate field scanning data	Calibration, Computer Graphics, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Software, Software Design	Computerized field scanning systems are now standard tools in most radiotherapy departments. These systems can easily measure central axis depth dose curves and beam profiles. Data acquired from these systems forms the basis of what is used for machine calibrations and patient dosimetry. Unfortunately, the data is often not in the best format for these applications. Each data point is often acquired in a fraction of a second with a small volume ionization chamber resulting in "noisy" data. Many dosimetric applications require tissue maximum ratio data which is technically difficult to directly measure with these scanning systems. And finally, it is desirable to have the data clearly organized in tables according to the specific needs of the department. Commercial spreadsheets can be used to solve these problems. We have used Lotus 1-2-3 to smooth the central axis data, calculate additional data points, calculate tissue maximum ratios, and clearly present this data in neatly organized tables	
4163	Late results in patients treated with pi-mesons for bladder cancer.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cystectomy, Female, Fibrosis, Humans, Incidence, Inflammation, Intestines, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Mesons, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Switzerland, Time, Universities, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND. The treatment of bladder cancer with 60 converging pion beams was expected to have certain dose-distribution advantages with possibly fewer side effects than other high linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation therapies, such as neutrons. RESULTS. Early results were promising: 20 of 24 (83%) evaluable patients with sessile invasive bladder carcinomas had clinically complete responses. However, only 3 of 10 (30%) evaluable patients with superficial bladder tumors had clinically complete responses. This article reports the long-term follow-up (6-8 years) of these patients with emphasis on the late side effects of pion radiation therapy. Thirty-eight of the 41 (93%) patients treated died after a median survival time of 17 months (range, 4-98 months). Seventeen (45%) died of metastatic disease (in two instances, this was combined with a local recurrence) 5-27 months after radiation therapy. Four (10%) died of locally progressive disease, and eight (21%) died of late side effects of radiation therapy 9-98 months after treatment. All these patients were treated with more than 33 pion Gy and had generally a symptom-free interval of 9-18 months. The observed side effects were severe, consisting of chronic inflammation and vascular damage in the pelvic region often followed by ulceration, fistulas, and perforations throughout the intestines. In 11 patients, cystectomy and urinary diversion was necessary because of excessive fibrosis and bladder shrinkage. In eight patients, a colostomy was required for stenotic inflammatory disease, necrosis, and perforations of the intestines. The remaining nine patients (24%) died of causes unrelated to the primary disease 4-60 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the first Phase I/II trial using the Swiss piotron showed a high complete response rate in patients with sessile bladder cancers but also a high incidence of local recurrences and severe, in some instances lethal side effects. Although it is expected that these results will be the basis for future improvements, particularly regarding dosing and fractionation, this experience emphasizes the need for a sufficiently long observation period before reaching conclusions about any high LET treatment, such as neutron, pion, or heavy ion radiation therapy	
1975	Tumor therapy and track structure. [Review] [45 refs]	Carbon, Electrons, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Relative Biological Effectiveness	The elevated relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of heavy ions like carbon is the main reason for their use in radiotherapy and is due to the microscopic distribution of dose inside each particle track. High local doses produce lesions that are expected to have a diminished possibility of repair. Thus, RBE depends on track structure and on the biological repair capacity of the tissue that is affected by the irradiation. For tumor treatment planning with heavy ions, the beam quality and the tissue sensitivity have to be taken into account. Using the dependence of radial dose distribution on particle energy and atomic number on the physical side and x-ray dose response for the repair capacity on the biological side, the response to particle irradiation can be calculated in the local effect model (LEM) and used for treatment planning. This article traces the route from electron emission as the basis of track structure to the RBE calculation and the application in treatment planning. [References: 45]

First, we examined the decrease of the survival rate and molecular weight of DNA purified from this cell by acid heat treatment. These decreases were recognized by heating at 55 degrees C below pH 5.0. Then, we assumed that the decrease in survival of D. radiodurans in vivo and damage to its DNA in vitro by acid heating were due to the release of purine rings from the phosphodiester backbone of DNA molecules, i.e., depurination. Second, we investigated the relation between LET (linear energy transfer) and RBE (relative biological effectiveness) on D. radiodurans dry and wet cells using AVF cyclotron at the TIARA facility of JAERI-Takasaki, Japan. These cells were irradiated with carbon (12C5+) ion beam at LET of about 100 keV/microm, neon (20Ne8+) ion beam at LET of about 300 keV/microm and oxygen (16O6+) ion beam at LET of about 400 keV/microm. The peak in the figure of the relation between LET and RBE value was found to increase according to the increase of LET value from 100 keV/microm. Third, we conducted combination treatment with 4.8 kGy of alpha-particles, i.e., boron 10 neutron captured beam induced by Kyoto University Research Nuclear Reactor operated at 5 MW, and hyperthermia at 52 degrees C, which caused the synergistic killing effect on D. radiodurans wet cells. However, being dissimilar to the case of gamma-irradiation, the interval incubation at 30 degrees C in the medium between both treatments could inhibit the recovery of survival. [References: 38]

Eight years of data have been analyzed for two ion chambers (and their associated electrometers) irradiated at fixed geometry in such a device. These dosimetry systems have also been calibrated every 2 years at a single Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory. Our analysis suggests that when a check source is used, and the results are consistent, the interval between formal calibrations can be lengthened	
1664	The overshoot phenomenon in step-and-shoot IMRT delivery	Computer Simulation, Dose Fractionation, Film Dosimetry, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Medical Errors, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation]	The control loop in the Varian DMLC system (V4.8) requires approximately 65 msec to monitor and halt the irradiation of a segment, causing an "overshoot" effect: the segment ends on a fractional monitor unit larger than that planned. As a result, the actual MU delivered may differ from that planned. In general, for step-and-shoot treatments, the first segment receives more, the last receives less, and intermediate segments vary. The overshoot for each segment (DeltaMU) is small, approximately 0.6 MU at 600 MU/min. Our IMRT planning system (Corvus) produces plans often having more than 20% of the segments with less than 1 MU/segment. Such segments may be skipped if the DeltaMU exceeds the segments' planned MU. Furthermore, QA filming often requires reducing the total MU by a factor of 4-6, increasing the potential for dosimetric error. This study measured DeltaMU over a range of MU/min and MU/segment. At >5 MU/segment, the DeltaMU was stable, corresponding to a delay of 62 msec. DeltaMU became larger and more variable at <1 MU/segment. The behavior was modeled in a computer program that predicted the change in delivered MU/segment and total change in delivered MU to each beamlet. Beams were analyzed for patients receiving 5 field prostate or 9 field head and neck treatments. At 400 MU/min, 28% and 16%, respectively, of the planned segments were skipped. For QA filming, up to 75% of the segments were skipped. The cumulative error averaged <0.1 MU/beamlet, but individual beamlets had errors exceeding 200%. The effect is most significant for low dose regions. Recommendations are given for deciding when to treat or do QA studies with lower MU/min. In general, treatments are not significantly affected, but QA films taken at reduced MU may be improved if irradiated at lowered MU/min

METHODS: The analysis is based on the demographic data concerning these patients, clinical data concerning the tumor, the treatment applied, the outcome, and the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation of intraocular and orbital metastasis, interval between primary tumor and ocular metastasis, survival of the patients, evaluation of various therapeutic protocols. RESULTS: Intraocular metastases (14 cases, 15 eyes) were situated in the choroid in 11 cases (isolated lesion, 6 cases; multiple lesions, 3 cases; diffuse involvement, 2 cases), in the iris and ciliary body in 2 cases, and in the retina and vitreous in 2 other cases. The primary tumor was a cutaneous melanoma in 8 cases, a melanoma of the contralateral eye in 3 cases, a mucosal melanoma in 1 case, and was unknown in 2 cases. The mean interval between the diagnosis of ocular metastases and the patient's death was 8.8 months (range, 1-48 months). The primary tumor in the 7 cases of orbital metastases was a cutaneous melanoma in 5 cases, a uveal melanoma in the contralateral eye in 1 case, and was unknown in 1 case. The mean interval between the diagnosis of orbital metastases and death was 19.7 months (range, 5-48 months). The patients were treated by various protocols. The best results, in terms of both local tumor control and preservation of visual function, were obtained with circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or external beam irradiation, depending on the site and extent of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic melanomas to the eye and orbit are rare and generally occur in patients with disseminated metastases during the terminal stages of the disease, with a short life expectancy. Treatment is palliative and, among the various possible treatment options, circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or global photon beam radiotherapy, at relatively high irradiation doses, seems to achieve the most favorable results	
65	Whole-body dose from tomotherapy delivery	Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Dosage, Scattering,Radiation, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Whole-Body Counting	PURPOSE: To measure whole-body dose in tomotherapy of the head and neck region resulting from internal patient scatter and linear accelerator leakage. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatments are performed using a commercial computer-controlled intensity modulated radiation therapy planning and delivery system (Peacock, NOMOS Corp.) and a 6-MV linear accelerator (Clinac 6/100, Varian Corp.). The patient dose outside the treatment field is measured in a water-equivalent phantom using thermoluminescent dosimetry. The whole-body dose components from internal scatter and leakage are separately determined. The use of fixed-portal leakage and scattered radiation measurements to estimate the whole-body dose from tomotherapy is evaluated. RESULTS: The internally scattered dose is significant near the target, but becomes negligible relative to the leakage dose beyond 15 cm from the target. Dose at 10 cm from the target volume, due to internal scatter and leakage, is approximately 2.5% of the total target dose, reducing to 0.5% at 30 cm. The measured dose is relatively uniform throughout the phantom. CONCLUSION: The whole-body dose equivalent from a tomotherapy treatment is greater than that from conventional radiation therapy. Further studies are required to assess the trade-off between improved dose distribution conformality and a possible slight increase in radiation-induced fatal malignancies. The accuracy of using fixed-portal leakage and scattered dose measurements to estimate the whole-body dose from tomotherapy treatments is adequate, if the appropriate fixed-portal field size equivalent is used	
1517	Do low dose-rate bystander effects influence domestic radon risks?	Air Pollution,Indoor/ae [Adverse Effects], Alpha Particles, Bystander Effect, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Biological, Radiation, Radon, Radon/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Time	PURPOSE: Radon risks derive from exposure of bronchio-epithelial cells to high-linear energy transfer (LET) alpha-particles. alpha-particle exposure can result in bystander effects, where irradiated cells emit signals resulting in damage to nearby unirradiated bystander cells. This can result in non-linear dose-response relations, and inverse dose-rate effects. Domestic radon risk estimates are currently extrapolated from miner data, which are at both higher doses and higher dose-rates, so bystander effects on unhit cells could play a large role in the extrapolation of risks from mines to homes. Therefore, we extend an earlier quantitative mechanistic model of bystander effects to include protracted exposure, with the aim of quantifying the significance of the bystander effect for very prolonged exposures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model of high-LET bystander effects, originally developed to analyse oncogenic transformation in vitro, is extended to low dose-rates. The model considers radiation response as a superposition of bystander and linear direct e It attributes bystander effects to a small subpopulation of hypersensitive cells, with the bystander contribution dominating the direct contribution at very low acute doses but saturating as the dose increases. Inverse dose-rate effects are attributed to the replenishment of the hypersensitive subpopulation during prolonged irradiation. RESULTS: The model was fitted to dose- and dose-rate-dependent radon-exposed miner data, suggesting that one directly hit target bronchio-epithelial cell can send bystander signals to about 50 neighbouring target cells. The model suggests that a naive linear extrapolation of radon miner data to low doses, without accounting for dose-rate, would result in an underestimation of domestic radon risks by about a factor of 4, a value comparable with the empirical estimate applied in the recent BEIR-VI report on radon risk estimation. CONCLUSIONS: Bystander effects represent a plausible quantitative and mechanistic explanation of inverse dose-rate effects by high-LET radiation, resulting in non-linear dose-response relations and a complex interplay between the effects of dose and exposure time. The model presented provides a potential mechanistic underpinning for the empirical exposure-time correction factors applied in the recent BEIR-VI for domestic radon risk estimation	
596	Neutron scattered dose equivalent to a fetus from proton radiotherapy of the mother	Air, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Maternal Exposure, Mental Retardation/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neutrons, Phantoms,Imaging, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Trimester,Second, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Risk, Survivors	Scattered neutron dose equivalent to a representative point for a fetus is evaluated in an anthropomorphic phantom of the mother undergoing proton radiotherapy. The effect on scattered neutron dose equivalent to the fetus of changing the incident proton beam energy, aperture size, beam location, and air gap between the beam delivery snout and skin was studied for both a small field snout and a large field snout. Measurements of the fetus scattered neutron dose equivalent were made by placing a neutron bubble detector 10 cm below the umbilicus of an anthropomorphic Rando phantom enhanced by a wax bolus to simulate a second trimester pregnancy. The neutron dose equivalent in milliSieverts (mSv) per proton treatment Gray increased with incident proton energy and decreased with aperture size, distance of the fetus representative point from the field edge, and increasing air gap. Neutron dose equivalent to the fetus varied from 0.025 to 0.450 mSv per proton Gray for the small field snout and from 0.097 to 0.871 mSv per proton Gray for the large field snout. There is likely to be no excess risk to the fetus of severe mental retardation for a typical proton treatment of 80 Gray to the mother since the scattered neutron dose to the fetus of 69.7 mSv is well below the lower confidence limit for the threshold of 300 mGy observed for the occurrence of severe mental retardation in prenatally exposed Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, based on the linear no threshold hypothesis, and this same typical treatment for the mother, the excess risk to the fetus of radiation induced cancer death in the first 10 years of life is 17.4 per 10,000 children	
3752	Water calorimetry and ionization chamber dosimetry in an 85-MeV clinical proton beam	Air, Belgium, Calorimetry, Calorimetry/is [Instrumentation], Calorimetry/mt [Methods], Heat, Humans, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Universities, Water	In recent years, the increased use of proton beams for clinical purposes has enhanced the demand for accurate absolute dosimetry for protons. As calorimetry is the most direct way to establish the absorbed dose and because water has recently been accepted as standard material for this type of beam, the importance of water calorimetry is obvious. In this work we report water calorimeter operation in an 85-MeV proton beam and a comparison of the absorbed dose to water measured by ionometry with the dose resulting from water calorimetric measurements. To ensure a proper understanding of the heat defect for defined impurities in water for this type of radiation, a relative response study was first done in comparison with theoretical calculations of the heat defect. The results showed that pure hypoxic water and hydrogen-saturated water yielded the same response with practically zero heat defect, in agreement with the model calculations. The absorbed dose inferred from these measurements was then compared with the dose derived from ionometry by applying the European Charged Heavy Particle Dosimetry (ECHED) protocol. Restricting the comparison to chambers recommended in the protocol, the calorimeter dose was found to be 2.6% +/- 0.9% lower than the average ionometry dose. In order to estimate the significance of chamber-dependent effects in this deviation, measurements were performed using a set of ten ionization chambers of five different types. The maximum internal deviation in the ionometry results amounted to 1.1%. We detected no systematic chamber volume dependence, but observed a small but systematic effect of the chamber wall thickness. The observed deviation between calorimetry and ionometry can be attributed to a combination of the value of (Wair/e)p for protons, adopted in the ECHED protocol, the mass stopping power ratios of water to air for protons, and possibly small ionization chamber wall effects	
3458	Accelerated helium-ion beams for radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery	California, Californium, Helium, Humans, Ions, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities	A new beam line for radiotherapy and radiosurgery with accelerated helium-ion beams has been set up at the Bevalac. The new treatment room has been equipped with a very precise patient positioner in order to utilize the superior dose localization properties of light-ion beams. The beam spreading and shaping system is described, the trade-offs involved in positioning the beam modifying devices are discussed, and the physical properties of the generated radiation fields are reported. The Bragg peak modulation by axial beam stacking employing a variable range shifter is explained and the control system including beam monitoring and dosimetry is presented

The article discusses: dose distributions in tissue, which are markedly different for particles than for high energy photons and so may be clinically advantageous for the former; differences in radiobiologic responses, which could lead to increased tumor cell killing and a possible increase in the therapeutic ratio for particles; clinical experience to date; directions for and impediments to future research	
2946	Evaluation of pre-irradiation on monoclonal antibody localization in colon tumor xenografts expressing a cell-associated antigen	Adenocarcinoma/me [Metabolism], Animals, Antibodies,Monoclonal/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Antigens,Neoplasm/im [Immunology], Carcinoembryonic Antigen/im [Immunology], Cell Line, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Colon, Colonic Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Mice, Mice,Nude, Protons, Radiation, Radioisotopes, Research, Time, Tissue Distribution, Transplantation,Heterologous, Tumor Cells,Cultured, Universities	We have previously demonstrated that external beam irradiation can increase radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) targeting of tumors expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a secreted glycoprotein. Increased tumor uptake was seen with both protons and gamma radiation (60Co). However, although pre-irradiation with protons resulted in greater activity within tumors than conventional radiation, normal tissues also exhibited increased uptake. This suggested that proton beam irradiation allowed more CEA to escape and bind to radiolabeled MAb in sites other than tumor. The purpose of the present study was to determine if a similar effect could be achieved, but without an increase in normal tissue activity, with a MAb directed against a cell-bound antigen. T380 and LS174T human colon tumors were implanted s.c. into athymic nude mice and irradiated with 10 Gy 60Co or proton beam. 111In-CYT-103 MAb (anti-TAG-72) was injected i.p. 2 hr later and the biodistribution of activity was determined 2 days thereafter. Tumor size at the time of external beam irradiation and biodistribution studies was similar among the groups within each tumor type. Increased targeting of radiolabeled MAb within tumors was not observed in either model after external beam irradiation compared to their respective nonirradiated controls, although some differences were observed in normal tissue uptake. These findings demonstrate that preirradiation for the purpose of enhancing MAb delivery to the tumor site is not a universal phenomenon and may be successful only with certain antibody/tumor antigen systems

2760	An investigation into the comparison between different dosimetric methods of measuring profiles and depth doses for dynamic wedges on a Varian 600C linear accelerator	Film Dosimetry, Humans, Methods, Models,Structural, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time	Three dosimetric methods for commissioning the dynamic wedges on a Varian 600C linear accelerator operating at 4.7 MV were compared. The techniques involved the use of ionization chambers, x-ray verification film and solid state detectors. Ionization chambers gave the most accurate results, as expected, but data acquisition was very time consuming. Film dosimetry was found to have good spatial resolution for beam profiles, but problems were encountered with the acquisition of depth doses. Solid state detectors generally showed reasonable agreement with the ionization chambers	
3990	Local temperature and pressure variations and its effects on daily ionometric measurements of radiation beam outputs from linear accelerators	Hospitals, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Physics, Pressure, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Science, Temperature, Universities	As part of the quality assurance protocol for linear accelerators at West Virginia University Hospitals, the local temperature and pressure are recorded on a daily basis by the radiation therapists. These temperature and pressure values are not used for temperature and pressure correction unless the ionometric measurements of radiation beam outputs from linear accelerators are outside the established tolerance levels. This paper presents a study on the variation of temperature and pressure over the past two years. Analysis of the data showed that the variation of pressure is within +/- 1.5% of the average value. Likewise, the variation of temperature is within +/- 1.5% of the average value. the worst possible effects of temperature and pressure on ionometric measurements would be within +/- 3%, which is at the tolerance levels recommended by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group No. 13. By maintaining machine output fluctuation to within +/- 2%, the maximum deviation of uncorrected ionometric measurements would be within +/- 5%. This study collaborates with the tolerance levels suggested by the AAPM Task Group No. 40	
2917	Metastasis from uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Humans, Incidence, Liver, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Time, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The incidence of metastasis and prognostic factors for metastasis in 780 consecutive patients with uveal melanomas treated with proton beam irradiation were evaluated. Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis	
4566	Evaluation of precalibrated implantable MOSFET radiation dosimeters for megavoltage photon beams	Algorithms, Calibration, Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Software, Temperature, Texas, Universities	We have studied the response of factory calibrated implantable MOSFET detectors to absorbed doses from 100 to 400 cGy. The average measured dose is quite close to the true delivered dose, with the standard deviation falling between 1.4 and 3.6%. The measured dose tends to be slightly underestimated for smaller doses, while it tends to be slightly overestimated for larger doses. Thus, although the calibration of the detector is most accurate for doses close to the calibration dose of 200 cGy, it may be used over the range of commonly used doses in fractionated radiotherapy	
621	An examination of the number of required apertures for step-and-shoot IMRT	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Software, Time Factors	We have examined the degree to which step-and-shoot IMRT treatment plans can be simplified (using a small number of apertures) without sacrificing the dosimetric quality of the plans. A key element of this study was the use of direct aperture optimization (DAO), an inverse planning technique where all of the multi-leaf collimator constraints are incorporated into the optimization. For seven cases (1 phantom, 1 prostate, 3 head-and-neck and 2 lung), DAO was used to perform a series of optimizations where the number of apertures per beam direction varied from 1 to 15. In this work, we attempt to provide general guidelines for how many apertures per beam direction are sufficient for various clinical cases using DAO. Analysis of the optimized treatment plans reveals that for most cases, only modest improvements in the objective function and the corresponding DVHs are seen beyond 5 apertures per beam direction. However, for more complex cases, some dosimetric gain can be achieved by increasing the number of apertures per beam direction beyond 5. Even in these cases, however, only modest improvements are observed beyond 9 apertures per beam direction. In our clinical experience, 38 out of the first 40 patients treated using IMRT plans produced using DAO were treated with 9 or fewer apertures per beam direction. The results indicate that many step-and-shoot IMRT treatment plans delivered today are more complex than necessary and can be simplified without sacrificing plan quality	
150	New horizons for therapy based on the boron neutron capture reaction. [Review] [29 refs]	Animals, Arthritis,Rheumatoid/rt [Radiotherapy], Boron Compounds/ad [Administration & Dosage], Boron Compounds/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/td [Trends], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Clinical Trials as Topic, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Mice, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Netherlands, Research, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is currently undergoing clinical trials in the USA, Japan and The Netherlands with patients afflicted with deadly brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme) or melanoma. This therapy relies on a binary process in which the capture of a slow neutron by a 10B nucleus leads to an energetic nuclear fission reaction, with the formation of 7Li3+ and 4He2+ and accompanied by about 2.4 MeV of energy. The fleeting 7Li3+ and 4He2+ travel a distance of only about the diameter of one cell, and they are deadly to any cell in which they have been produced. Research in progress is concerned with the development of advanced boron agents and neutron sources, other than nuclear reactors, for the treatment of a variety of cancer types using novel 10B delivery methods. Non-malignant diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis offer additional opportunities for BNCT. The entire BNCT area awaits commercialization. [References: 29]	
2921	Cataract extraction after proton beam irradiation for malignant melanoma of the eye.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Cataract Extraction, Cataract/pp [Physiopathology], Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Postoperative Complications, Risk, Risk Factors, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	We evaluated visual outcome and risk of metastases in patients who underwent cataract extraction after protonbeam irradiation of a uveal melanoma. A total of 84 patients underwent cataract extraction between 2 months and 11 years after irradiation. One year after cataract extraction, approximately half of the patients had visual acuity of 20/100 or better, and approximately one third had an acuity of 20/40 or better. Larger tumor size was highly correlated with poor visual outcome 1 year after extraction. Six patients underwent enucleation after cataract removal, five due to blind, painful eyes and one due to continued growth of a previously undiagnosed ring melanoma. The rate of metastases was not higher among patients who underwent cataract extraction (adjusted rate ratio, 0.83). Results suggest that cataract extraction offers improvement of vision in selected eyes previously irradiated for a uveal melanoma, without adding to the risk of metastases among patients undergoing the procedure

The mean age of patients was 37 years, the male/female ratio 1:1.1. The most frequent complaints were diplopia with oculomotor disorders (51%), headache (31%), and decreased hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus with statoacusticus dysfunction (21%). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 27 months. The chondrosarcomas were located in the petrosal bone in 37% (47 cases), in the occipital bone and clivus in 23% (30 cases), in the sphenoid bone in 20% (25 cases) and to a lesser extent in frontal, ethmoidal, and parietal bones (14%). In 6% (eight cases) the primary location was in dural tissue. Radiological examinations showed bone destruction and variable calcification (CT), involvement of neuronal and vascular structures (MRI), and mostly hypovascularity on angiography. On histological examination 51% of tumours were classified as grade I, 11% grade II, 30% mesenchymal, and 8% myxoid. The mesenchymal type was the most malignant as illustrated by a strong tendency to intradural and cerebral growth and possibly occurrence in younger age groups. The treatment of choice until recently was surgery because of the critical location and local aggressive nature. Regrowth of tumour after surgery occurred in 53% of the patients (average after 32 months). Charged particle irradiation gave a five year survival of 83-94% and a local control rate of 78%-91%. Both in surgery and radiotherapy there is treatment related morbidity and mortality that should be considered when offering these therapies. Recent promising results imply that charged particle radiotherapy, in combination with surgery, may be the therapeutical choice of the future. [References: 46]

DSB yields were measured by calibrated Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis in the DNA fragment size range 0.023-5.7 Mbp. The DSB yields show little LET dependence, in spite of the large variation of the latter among the beams, and are slightly higher than that obtained using gamma rays. The highest yield was found for the 5 GeV u(-1) iron beam, that gave a value 30% higher than the 1 GeV u(-1) iron beam. A phenomenological method is used to parametrise deviation from randomness in fragment size spectra

590	Experimental determination of particle range and dose distribution in thick targets through fragmentation reactions of stable heavy ions	Algorithms, Carbon, Carbon/ch [Chemistry], Computer Simulation, Gamma Cameras, Gamma Rays, Heavy Ions, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Neon, Neon/ch [Chemistry], Nitrogen, Nitrogen/ch [Chemistry], Oxygen/ch [Chemistry], Particle Accelerators, Polyethylene/ch [Chemistry], Polymethyl Methacrylate, Polymethyl Methacrylate/ch [Chemistry], Radiation, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Water, Water/ch [Chemistry]	In radiation therapy with highly energetic heavy ions, the conformal irradiation of a tumour can be achieved by using their advantageous features such as the good dose localization and the high relative biological effectiveness around their mean range. For effective utilization of such properties, it is necessary to evaluate the range of incident ions and the deposited dose distribution in a patient's body. Several methods have been proposed to derive such physical quantities; one of them uses positron emitters generated through projectile fragmentation reactions of incident ions with target nuclei. We have proposed the application of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to a detected annihilation gamma-ray distribution for determination of the range of incident ions in a target and we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method with computer simulations. In this paper, a water, a polyethylene and a polymethyl methacrylate target were each irradiated with stable (12)C, (14)N, (16)O and (20)Ne beams. Except for a few combinations of incident beams and targets, the MLE method could determine the range of incident ions R(MLE) with a difference between R(MLE) and the experimental range of less than 2.0 mm under the circumstance that the measurement of annihilation gamma rays was started just after the irradiation of 61.4 s and lasted for 500 s. In the process of evaluating the range of incident ions with the MLE method, we must calculate many physical quantities such as the fluence and the energy of both primary ions and fragments as a function of depth in a target. Consequently, by using them we can obtain the dose distribution. Thus, when the mean range of incident ions is determined with the MLE method, the annihilation gamma-ray distribution and the deposited dose distribution can be derived simultaneously. The derived dose distributions in water for the mono-energetic heavy-ion beams of four species were compared with those measured with an ionization chamber. The good agreement between the derived and the measured distributions implies that the deposited dose distribution in a target can be estimated from the detected annihilation gamma-ray distribution with a positron camera	
1743	Development and calculation of an energy dependent normal brain tissue neutron RBE for evaluating neutron fields for BNCT	Absorption, Adult, Animals, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Cell Line, Dogs, Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Theoretical, Neutrons, Ohio, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Dosage, Reference Values, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities	In Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) of malignant brain tumors, the energy dependence of a clinically relevant Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for epithermal neutrons, RBE(En), is important in neutron field design. In the first half of this paper, we present the development of an expression for the energy dependent normal-tissue RBE, RBE(En). We then calculate a reasonable estimate for RBE(En) for adult brain tissue. In the second half of the paper, two separate RBE expressions are developed, one for the RBE of the neutrons that interact in tissue via the 14N(n,p)14C reaction, denoted RBE(N), and one for the RBE of the neutrons which interact in tissue via the 1H(n,n')1H reaction, denoted RBE(H). The absorbed-dose-averaged values of these expressions are calculated for the neutron flux spectrum in phantom for the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) epithermal neutron beam. The calculated values, [RBE(norm)N] = 3.4 and [RBE(norm)H] = 3.2, are within 6% of being equal, and support the use of equal values for RBEN and RBE(H) by researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Finally, values of [RBE(norm)N] and [RBE(norm)H], along with the absorbed-dose-averaged RBE for brain, [RBE(norm)b], were calculated as a function of depth along the centerline of an ellipsoidal head phantom using flux spectra calculated for our Accelerator-Based Neutron Source (ABNS). These values remained essentially constant with depth, supporting the use of constant values for RBE, as is done at BNL

The developing brain is particularly susceptible to production of deleterious effects, with decreased brain size, behavioural alterations, and mental retardation having been documented. Supplementing the limited human data, rodent models have been extensively used to investigate the specific processes by which relatively low doses, with correspondingly minor cellular damage to the developing neocortex, can produce dramatic postnatal consequences in brain structure and function. The effects of a variety of physical (dose, linear energy transfer, dose rate, fractionation) and biological (species, strain, gestational age, time course post-irradiation) parameters have been examined in an attempt to provide much needed information on such critical aspects as dose response, threshold doses for effect, and extrapolation to human risk estimates. Various acute cellular responses (e.g. appearance of pyknotic cells and macrophages) observed in the developing neocortex 0-24 h after in utero irradiation can be associated with postnatal effects. Moreover, it is possible to correlate thinning of specific layers of the cerebral cortex with specific behavioural aberrations, allowing prediction of brain structural changes from functional alterations, and vice versa. Thus, it is possible to speculate as to the mechanisms and targets for extremely sensitive, radiation-induced cellular damage in the developing foetal brain, that will interfere with the orderly and precisely programmed development of the mammalian brain, leading finally to postnatal expression as delays in growth and development, perturbations in behaviour, and alterations in brain structure	
21	Clinical commissioning of Laitinen Stereoadapter for fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy	Dose Fractionation, Head/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Head/ra [Radiography], Head/su [Surgery], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	The Laitinen Stereoadapter 5000 from Sandstroem Trade and Technology was acceptance tested and commissioned for clinical use in a Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy Program at our facility. The frame was implemented to function as a localization device for target delineation rather than as an immobilization device. The frame is of non-invasive nature utilizing ear plugs and a nasion bridge adapter as the connecting points with the patient's head. The reproducibility of the head frame position with respect to external skull reference points was tested. CT and MRI imaging studies were performed on a patient phantom with the stereoadapter in place. The target was delineated and target coordinates were calculated for two implanted targets. The phantom was positioned according to the target coordinates on a Siemens MXE Linear Accelerator by aid of the target positioning lasers. Radiographic port film images were taken with the circular fields typically used in stereotactic radiosurgery. A complete treatment isodose plan was performed and dosimetric accuracy was tested by positioning a small volume ionization chamber at the center of the target volume in the head phantom. The results of these tests were found to be clinically acceptable

The absorbed dose standard for ocular proton therapy beams at HCL was based on a fluence measurement with a Faraday cup (FC). A majority of proton therapy centers worldwide, however, use an absorbed dose standard that is based on an ionization chamber (IC) technique. The ion chamber calibration is deduced from a measurement in a reference 60Co photon field together with a calculated correction factor that takes into account differences in a chamber's response in 60Co and proton fields. In this work, we implemented an ionization chamber-based absolute dosimetry system for the HCL ocular beamline based on the recommendations given in Report 59 by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements. Comparative measurements revealed that the FC system yields an absorbed dose to water value that is 1.1% higher than was obtained with the IC system. That difference is small compared with the experimental uncertainties and is clinically insignificant. In June of 1998, we adopted the IC-based method as our standard practice for the ocular beam

4168	Optimisation of dose distribution for linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery	Algorithms, Computer-Aided Design, Humans, Korea, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Therapy,Computer-Assisted, Time, Universities	The work presented in the paper addresses a method for obtaining the optimal dose distribution for LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery. As many targets have nonspherical or irregular shapes and three-dimensional dose calculations included in dose optimisation, long computation times are required to determine the optimum isocentre separation and collimator sizes to shape the irregular target using the multiple-isocentre approach, by trial-and-error types of method. The simple approach, using a computer-aided design optimisation technique and a fast approximate dose model, has been developed to find the optimum isocentre positions and collimator sizes quickly and automatically. A spherical dose model has been developed to represent the dose for a standard arc system with a single isocentre. The implementation of computer-aided design algorithms with the spherical dose model and their application to several cases are discussed. It is shown that the spherical dose model gives dose distribution similar to that of the exact dose model, which makes this simple dose model more efficient, with computer-aided design optimisation, in finding optimum isocentre positions and collimator sizes used in stereotactic radiosurgery

Some adverse effects such as optic neuropathy can compromise the visual outcome. We were interested in determining the risk factors for radiation papillopathy. Since there is currently no effective therapy, this is an interesting way to improve prevention of optic neuropathy. Six hundred sixty-two eyes had more than 24 month follow-up after proton-beam irradiation for uveal melanoma. In five hundred twenty-two cases, the clinical examination of the optic nerve head by ophthalmoscopy was possible. One-hundred eleven optic discs were pathologic, whereas 411 remained disease-free. Retrospective study of these two groups allowed to quantify the risk factors for optic neuropathy. The irradiation of more than 2mm of optic nerve at 30 Grays-equivalents appeared to be the major risk factor for optic neuropathy. For a given irradiation dose, the observed pattern of clinical responses was heterogeneous. These results are discussed and compared to the previous published reports. Visual results and life prognosis are also discussed, considering the optic nerve head status. Proton-beam therapy can preserve the optic nerve when the tumor location allows to keep it away from the irradiation-field. Patients must be informed about the risk of optic neuropathy after proton-beam irradiation	
936	Time course of serum cytokines in patients receiving proton or combined photon/proton beam radiation for resectable but medically inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer	Adenocarcinoma/bl [Blood], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Biological Markers, Biological Markers/bl [Blood], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/bl [Blood], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/bl [Blood], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Collagen Type III/bl [Blood], Female, Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/bl [Blood], Fibrosis, Humans, Incidence, Interleukins/bl [Blood], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Pneumonitis/bl [Blood], Radiotherapy, Research, Time, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/an [Analysis]	PURPOSE: We prospectively measured the levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and procollagen III peptide (P III P) in serum from non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with photons combined with protons or protons alone. These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome	
3305	19F-[1H] nuclear Overhauser effect and proton decoupling of 5-fluorouracil and alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine	beta-Alanine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], beta-Alanine/ch [Chemistry], beta-Alanine/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Fluorine, Fluorouracil/ch [Chemistry], Fluorouracil/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Germany, Humans, Liver, Liver/me [Metabolism], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Solutions	19F-[1H] magnetic double-resonance experiments were performed on model solutions of the antitumor drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) in order to improve 19F NMR sensitivity for the application in pharmacokinetic studies in vivo. Upon driving the proton spins into saturation, a fluorine signal enhancement (nuclear Overhauser effect) was observed on the order of the theoretical NOE maximum gamma H/2 gamma F = 53% for purely dipolar coupled 19F-1H spin systems in extreme narrowing. The dependence of the effect on proton excitation frequency and temporal parameters was measured and cross-relaxation rate constants of 0.07 s-1 (5-FU) and 0.19 s-1 (FBAL) were determined. Irradiation of the proton spin system by a broad pulse during the 19F signal detection period removed FBAL multiplet splittings completely and narrowed the linewidth of this resonance band by a factor of six. Application of proton presaturation in the 19F NMR examination of a patient undergoing 5-FU chemotherapy enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio of the major 5-FU catabolite FBAL detected noninvasively in the liver

Photofrin-mediated photosensitization resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent induction of IL-6 mRNA production. Maximal levels were reached after 4 h and had decreased to baseline levels after 24 h. This photochemical induction of IL-6 transcription was followed by a strong secretion of IL-6 protein. In comparison to stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the kinetics of IL-6 mRNA and protein synthesis after PDT were delayed, although the maximal amounts of secreted IL-6 protein were comparable. As compared to UV irradiation, on the other hand, PDT-induced IL-6 protein levels were 2- to 10-fold higher and were detectable 4 h earlier. Several potentially relevant regulatory DNA elements of the IL-6 promoter were analyzed by gel retardation assays for PDT-induced protein binding. Interestingly, increased AP-1 DNA binding was detected only at the distal AP-1-specific motif and not at the proximal site, differing in 1 bp. Binding of c-Fos-containing AP-1 heterodimers to the specific motif was up-regulated 30 min after PDT, reaching maximal activity at 4 h. This PDT-induced AP-1 activation was independent from protein kinase C activity. Photosensitization did not induce increased binding at the well-characterized NF-kappa B element, nor at the multiple cytokine- and second messenger-responsive element of the IL-6 promoter. By analyzing the molecular mechanisms of IL-6 up-regulation upon PDT, we provide evidence for regulatory differences compared to UV light, ionizing irradiation, or stimulation by phorbol ester. Furthermore, this study suggests that the "proinflammatory" cytokine IL-6 might be involved in the inflammatory reaction and subsequent immunological antitumor responses	
425	IMRT treatment planning based on prioritizing prescription goals	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Research, Software, Treatment Outcome	Determining the 'best' optimization parameters in IMRT planning is typically a time-consuming trial-and-error process with no unambiguous termination point. Recently we and others proposed a goal-programming approach which better captures the desired prioritization of dosimetric goals. Here, individual prescription goals are addressed stepwise in their order of priority. In the first step, only the highest order goals are considered (target coverage and dose-limiting normal structures). In subsequent steps, the achievements of the previous steps are turned into hard constraints and lower priority goals are optimized, in turn, subject to higher priority constraints. So-called 'slip' factors were introduced to allow for slight, clinically acceptable violations of the constraints. Focusing on head and neck cases, we present several examples for this planning technique. The main advantages of the new optimization method are (i) its ability to generate plans that meet the clinical goals, as well as possible, without tuning any weighting factors or dose-volume constraints, and (ii) the ability to conveniently include more terms such as fluence map smoothness. Lower level goals can be optimized to the achievable limit without compromising higher order goals. The prioritized prescription-goal planning method allows for a more intuitive and human-time-efficient way of dealing with conflicting goals compared to the conventional trial-and-error method of varying weighting factors and dose-volume constraints

This total is made of 20 men and 17 women aged between 19 and 81 years with a mean age of 54.7 years. Tumors were localized in the bulbar conjunctival in 27 cases, in the palpebral conjunctival in 2 cases and were diffuse in 8 cases. Cornea was infiltrated in 19 cases. In 21 cases, the first treatment was made in our service and 16 cases were recurrences following a treatment made elsewhere. The mortality rate to 5 years was 20%. In a multivariant analysis using the COX Model, the height of the tumor was the only significant parameter (p = 0.035) for life expectancy. Recurrence of the tumor (p = 0.060) and presence of a PAM (p = 0.652) were not significant parameters. Benefits of cryocoagulation and indications for a proton beam irradiation are discussed

4199	Hypertension does not cause spontaneous hemorrhage of intracranial arteriovenous malformations	Adult, Boston, Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Female, Humans, Hypertension/co [Complications], Injections, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Male, Massachusetts, Pressure, Rupture,Spontaneous, Skull	The authors measured blood pressure changes non-invasively in 56 conscious, unpremedicated patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) during preparation for proton beam therapy. The procedure requires six injections of local anesthetic and application of a stereotactic frame by fixation into the outer table of the skull, and has been used during the past 20 yr to treat over 1,000 patients with cerebral AVMs. No effort was made to control blood pressure. Blood pressure increased during administration of the local anesthetic and application of the frame. Maximum systolic and mean arterial pressures averaged 160 +/- 17 and 118 +/- 7 mmHg (mean +/- SD), respectively. This represented an average increase of 44 mmHg (38%) in systolic pressure and 32 mmHg (37%) in mean blood pressure at some point during the procedure (P less than 0.01 compared with pretreatment control pressures). Systolic pressure increased more than 60 mmHg in 21% of patients. Nevertheless, none of these 56 patients nor any of the more than 1,000 patients treated in similar fashion suffered a clinically evident AVM hemorrhage during the procedure. Since the treatment protocol has not changed materially during the past 20 yr, the authors assume that most patients treated in this fashion developed a similar degree of hypertension and conclude from this large clinical experience that moderate arterial hypertension does not precipitate spontaneous hemorrhage of intracranial AVMs	
1210	Optimization of physical dose distributions with hadron beams: comparing photon IMRT with IMPT	Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Carbon/ch [Chemistry], Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Germany, Humans, Ions, Ions/ch [Chemistry], Lead, Light, Male, Movement, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Oncology/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Risk, Time	Intensity modulated radiotherapy with high enery photons (IMRT) and with charged particles (IMPT) refer to the most advanced development in conformal radiation therapy. Their general aim is to increase local tumor control rates while keeping the radiation induced complications below desired thresholds. IMRT is currently widely introduced in clinical practice. However, the more complicated IMPT is still under development. Especially, spot- scanning techniques integrated in rotating gantries that can deliver proton or light ion-beams to a radiation target from any direction will be available in the near future. We describe the basic concepts of intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT). Starting from the potential advantages of hadron therapy inverse treatment planning strategies are discussed for various dose delivery techniques of IMPT. Of special interest are the techniques of distal edge tracking (DET) and 3D-scanning. After the introduction of these concepts a study of comparative inverse treatment planning is presented. The study aims to identify the potential advantages of achievable physical dose distributions with proton and carbon beams, if different dose delivery techniques are employed. Moreover, a comparison to standard photon IMRT is performed. The results of the study are summarized as: i) IMRT with photon beams is a strong competitor to intensity modulated radiotherapy with charged particles. The most obvious benefit observed for charged particles is the reduction of medium and low doses in organs at risk. ii) The 3D-scanning technique could not improve the dosimetric results achieved with DET, although 10-15 times more beam spots were employed for 3D-scanning than for DET. However, concerns may arise about the application of DET, if positioning errors of the patient or organ movements have to be accounted for. iii) Replacing protons with carbon ions leads to further improvements of the physical dose distributions. However, the additional degree of improvement due to carbon ions is modest. The main clinical potential of heavy ion beams is probably related to their radiobiological properties

4189	An analytical solution for the dynamic control of multileaf collimators	Acceleration, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Structural, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Sweden, Time	All current optimization techniques in radiation therapy benefit from the use of strongly non-uniform radiation beams. The most flexible way of generating these fields under real time control is by elementary beam scanning and/or dynamic multileaf collimation. In this work general analytical expressions are derived for the required motion of the collimator leaves to achieve a desired energy fluence distribution or collimator opening density in the patient in the shortest possible time. By simplification of the general expressions the equations of motion have been derived for both the shrinking field and the curtain shutter techniques with the associated approximations clearly quantified. The mechanical limitations on leaf motion, caused by the finite velocity and acceleration, are taken into account. It is shown that almost any desired energy fluence distribution can be created even when the limitations on velocity and acceleration are considered. The basic rule with the curtain shutter technique is that when the energy fluence gradient along the direction of motion of the leaves is positive, the leading leaf should move at maximum speed and the lagging leaf should modulate the field. In regions where the gradient is negative the lagging leaf should instead move at full speed and the leading leaf should modulate the field. The overall treatment time is then proportional to the total increment in energy fluence or opening density between consecutive minima and maxima. For energy fluence profiles with numerous high peaks the treatment time may therefore increase considerably over that for conventional uniform dose delivery. However, in general the treatment time is prolonged by a factor of about two compared to a traditional uniform treatment. Obviously the method developed here for multileaf collimators is also suitable for simple block collimators since it can be used to deliver arbitrary regular or irregular 'dynamic wedge' profiles along the direction of motion of the collimator blocks

Furthermore, for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), respiratory gating will minimize the hot and cold spot artifacts in dose distributions that may occur as a result of interplay between respiratory motion and leaf motion. Most implementations of respiration gating rely on the real time knowledge of the relative position of the internal anatomy being treated with respect to that of an external marker. A method to determine the amplitude of motion and account for any difference in phase between the internal tumor motion and external marker motion has been developed. Treating patients using gating requires several clinical decisions, such as whether to gate during inhale or exhale, whether to use phase or amplitude tracking of the respiratory signal, and by how much the intrafraction tumor motion can be decreased at the cost of increased delivery time. These parameters may change from patient to patient. A method has been developed to provide the data necessary to make decisions as to the CTV to PTV margins to apply to a gated treatment plan

METHODS: A patient experienced persistent unilateral panuveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. Inflammation and pressure worsened after cataract extraction and lens implantation. Diagnostic vitrectomy was non-revealing. RESULTS: Repeat vitrectomy and lens implant removal revealed a ciliary body mass, suggestive of melanoma. Ultrasonography and clinical evaluation by the retinal oncologists supported this diagnosis. The uveitis persisted despite aggressive medical treatments, including methotrexate. Proton beam irradiation of the melanoma led to resolution of uveitis and restoration of normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Ciliary body melanoma can present as chronic uveitis and refractory glaucoma	
1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results	
988	Efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Cranial Nerve Diseases/et [Etiology], Cranial Nerve Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Cranial Nerve Injuries/et [Etiology], Databases,Factual, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glomus Jugulare Tumor/co [Complications], Glomus Jugulare Tumor/su [Surgery], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Multiple Primary/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Complications/ep [Epidemiology], Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Safety	OBJECT: Since the mid-1990s the use of radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors has grown in popularity. Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings continue to support radiosurgery as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors that results in low rates of morbidity	
2395	The Clatterbridge high-energy neutron facility: dosimetry intercomparisons	Belgium, Calibration, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Manikins, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Universities, Washington	Dosimetry intercomparisons have been performed between the Clatterbridge high-energy neutron facility and the following institutions, all employing beams with similar neutron energies: Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium; University of Washington, Seattle, USA; MD Anderson Hospital, Houston, USA; and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, USA. The purpose of the intercomparison was to provide a basis for the exchange of dose-response data and to facilitate the involvement of Clatterbridge in collaborative clinical trials. Tissue-equivalent ionization chambers were used by the participants in each intercomparison to compare measurements of total (neutron plus gamma) absorbed dose in the host institution's neutron beam, following calibration of the chambers in a reference photon beam. The effects of differences in exposure standards, chamber responses in the neutron beams and protocol-dependent dosimetry factors were all investigated. It was concluded that the overall difference in the measurement of absorbed dose relative to that determined by the Clatterbridge group was less than 2%

This article reviews the use of a commercial system, the Peacock system, which uses a special multileaf collimator (MIMiC) to deliver the dose distribution using arc therapy and segmented fields, similar to a moving strip. Although initially designed for stereotactic radiosurgery, this system has been employed to treat various body sites. More than 300 patients have been treated at our institution in the past 4 years, mainly for cranial, head-and-neck, and prostate tumors. Presently, we treat 40 to 45 patients per day with this technology using two linear accelerators operating with 10 MV and 15 MV x-rays, as Peacock has become a standard therapy procedure. Cases are presented that show the unique ability of IMRT to deliver conformal dose distributions. Why this type of technology can become a standard procedure and why it is cost-effective therapy for both the institution and the patient are discussed. [References: 17]	
4589	Proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanoma: results of Curie Institut-Orsay proton therapy center (ICPO)	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation/ut [Utilization], Female, France, Humans, Incidence, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Patients, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: This study reports the results of proton beam radiotherapy based on a retrospective series of patients treated for uveal melanoma at the Orsay Center. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications	
3322	Monte Carlo and convolution dosimetry for stereotactic radiosurgery	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities, Water	The dosimetry of small photon beams used for stereotactic radiosurgery was investigated using Monte Carlo simulation, convolution calculations, and measurements. A Monte Carlo code was used to simulate radiation transport through a linear accelerator to produce and score energy spectrum and angular distribution of 6 MV bremsstrahlung photons exiting from the accelerator treatment head. These photons were then transported through a stereotactic collimator system and into a water phantom placed at isocenter. The energy spectrum was also used as input for the convolution method of photon dose calculation. Monte Carlo and convolution results were compared with the measured data obtained using an ionization chamber, a diode, and film

3436	The potential role of proton beams in radiation oncology. [Review] [12 refs]	Boston, Clinical Trials as Topic, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Massachusetts, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Universities, X-Rays	Historically, major gains in the local control of large, deep-seated tumors treated with radiation have occurred whenever dose distributions have become more localized to the tumor. Better dose localization permits the delivery of higher tumor doses while delivering less dose to dose-limiting normal tissues. High-energy protons, because they stop abruptly in tissue at the end of their range and deposit most of their energy there, provide dose distributions that are superior to x-rays when used in comparable beam configurations. The installation of a hospital-based proton therapy facility at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, and the existing facility at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA, provide a potential for achieving higher rates of local control in tumors throughout the body.

2891	A versatile plutonium-238 irradiator for radiobiological studies with alpha-particles	Alpha Particles, Animals, Humans, Plutonium, Plutonium/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radiobiology, Radiobiology/is [Instrumentation], Radon, Research, Suspensions	A versatile irradiator has been constructed for in vitro irradiation of mammalian cells with alpha-particles of well-defined energy, LET, direction, dose and dose rate. It is based on approximately 1.2 x 10(9) Bq of 238Pu (on a platinum disc) contained in a He-filled chamber. In a standard configuration, monolayers of cells grown in 10 Hostaphan-based dishes are irradiated with 3.26 +/- 0.22 MeV alpha-particles (LET 121 keV microns-1) at selectable dose rates from approximately 2 Gy min-1 down to less than 10(-4) Gy min-1 (i.e. fluence rates of 1 x 10(7) cm-2 min-1 to 3 x 10(2) cm-2 min-1). Single dishes can be irradiated at dose rates up to 24 Gy min-1 (fluence rate 1 x 10(8) cm-2 min-1). Incident energy and LET can be varied from 0.8 to 4.2 MeV and 266 to 102 keV microns-1, respectively. The irradiator has full incubation and gassing facilities for protracted irradiations. The irradiator is particularly suitable for in vitro analytical studies of the biological effects of alpha-particles of energies and LETs similar to those which cells may receive in vivo from radionuclides such as radon and the actinides. It has been used successfully for investigations of a variety of alpha-particle-induced effects in different cell types irradiated either as attached monolayers or as very thin suspensions	
601	The potential of proton beam radiation therapy in gastrointestinal cancer	Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Models,Biological, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sweden, Uncertainty	A group of Swedish oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In gastrointestinal cancers, it is assessed that at least 345 patients, mainly non-resectable rectal cancers, oesophageal and liver cancers, are eligible. Great uncertainties do however exist both in the number of patients with gastrointestinal cancers suitable for radiation therapy, and in the proportion of those where proton beams may give sufficiently better results	
1596	Radiation safety systems for accelerator facilities. [Review] [10 refs]	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Safety	The radiation safety system RSS) of an accelerator facility is used to protect people from prompt radiation hazards associated with accelerator operation. The RSS is a fully interlocked, engineered system with a combination of passive and active elements that are reliable, redundant and fail-safe. The RSS consists of the access control system (ACS) and the radiation containment system (RCS). The ACS is to keep people away from the dangerous radiation inside the shielding enclosure. The RCS limits and contains the beam/radiation conditions to protect people from the prompt radiation hazards outside the shielding enclosure in both normal and abnormal operations. The complexity of an RSS depends on the accelerator and its operation. as well as associated hazard conditions. The approaches of RSS among different facilities can be different. This report gives a review of the RSS for accelerator facilities. [References: 10]

To design a new protocol that employs epithermal neutron beams in the treatment of glioma patients, we examined the relationship between the radiation dose, histological tumor grade, and clinical outcome. Since 1968, 183 patients with different kinds of brain tumors were treated by BNCT; for this retrospective study, we selected 105 patients with glial tumors who were treated in Japan between 1978 and 1997. In the analysis of side effects due to radiation, we included all the 159 patients treated between 1977 and 2001. With respect to the radiation dose (i.e. physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction), the new protocol prescribes a minimum tumor volume dose of 15 Gy or, alternatively, a minimum target volume dose of 18 Gy. The maximum vascular dose should not exceed 15 Gy (physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction) and the total amount of gamma rays should remain below 10 Gy, including core gamma rays from the reactor and capture gamma in brain tissue. The outcomes for 10 patients who were treated by the new protocol using a new mode composed of thermal and epithermal neutrons are reported

3467	Output factor constituents of a high-energy photon beam	Air, California, Californium, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Universities, Water	Measurements designed to separate primary and various scatter components of central axis dose of the highest energy photon beam of the CGR Saturne 25 linear accelerator are described. This beam has an unusually large output variation with field size. The measurements are performed both in air and in a water phantom, with and without an aperture external to the collimator system. Results are presented in the form of relative output factors for different field sizes due to (i) flattening filter scatter, (ii) water phantom scatter, (iii) collimator backscatter into the monitor chamber, and (iv) collimator forward scatter onto the central axis. It is found that the flattening filter is the single largest scatter component, but that each of the other factors is significant in determining the output dose per monitor unit as a function of field size	
4041	Hereditary damage	Animals, Chromosome Aberrations, Chromosomes/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Male, Mice, Mutation, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Risk, Risk Assessment	For the purposes of radiation protection, risk estimates should be based on effects of irradiation at low doses and low dose-rates. Although few genetic studies have been made on effects at low doses those carried out at low dose-rates suggest that the response is generally linear for induction of both gene mutations and chromosomes aberrations. For obtaining an overall genetic risk assessment under these conditions a doubling dose of 100 rem (1 Sv) has been used by the ICRP and other bodies, with respect to radiation of low LET. In addition, it is necessary to know frequencies of human hereditary conditions, the extent to which these frequencies are maintained by recurrent mutation and the average number of generations the different categories of hereditary damage persist in the population. By the use of this information, as well as some data on translocation induction obtained directly from human exposures, an estimate of the risk of serious hereditary ill health in the first two generations after low-level radiation exposure was obtained for the Commission by one of its task groups. Thus the estimate of 10-2 Sv-1 used in ICRP 26 has a factual basis, although a number of far-reaching assumptions have still to be made when any risk estimation of this nature is attempted

A particularly interesting approach is in radioimmunotherapy. However, alpha-emitting antibody conjugates have been difficult to exploit clinically due to the short half-life of the radionuclides, low production capability, or limited source materials. We have developed a novel technology based on the low-dose rate alpha-particle-emitting nuclide (227)Th, exemplified here using the monoclonal antibody rituximab. In vitro, this radioimmunoconjugate killed lymphoma cells at Becquerel per milliliter (Bq/mL) levels. A single injection of (227)Th-rituximab induced complete tumor regression in up to 60% of nude mice bearing macroscopic (32-256 mm(3)) human B-lymphoma xenografts at Becquerel per gram (Bq/g) levels without apparent toxicity. Therapy with (227)Th-rituximab was significantly more effective than the control radioimmunoconjugate (227)Th-trastuzumab and the standard beta-emitting radioimmunoconjugate for CD20(+) lymphoma(90)Y-tiuxetan-ibritumomab. Thorium-227 based constructs may provide a novel approach for targeted therapy against a wide variety of cancers

Tumor risk assessments for cosmonauts over lifetime after flights are also given. Dependences of the delayed radiation consequences mentioned above on flight duration, spacecraft shielding thicknesses, solar activity and cosmonauts' age are analyzed. c2002 COSPAR.

2557	Unexpectedly large dose rate dependent output from a linear accelerator	Biophysics, Calibration, Electronics, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation]	During our routine calibration of a Varian Clinac-20 linear accelerator, the absorbed dose for a fixed monitor unit (mu) was found to decrease with increasing dose rate. Between dose rates of 100 and 500 mu/min, there was up to 20% difference in absorbed dose for a 20-MeV electron beam. The cause of this problem was a failure in the electronics circuit of an integrating board. This paper presents our analysis of the problem and suggests a possible means of isolating such a failure to warn technologists, physicists, and engineers

The measurements were performed in an ovarian cancer cell line (NIH:OVCAR 3) growing intraperitoneally in nude mice. Two weeks after the intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 x 10(7) cells of the human ovarian cancer cell line NIH:OVCAR-3 twenty mice were treated intraperitoneally with the specific monoclonal antibody MOv-18 labelled with either 211At (310-400 kBq) or 131I (5100-6200 kBq). The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of labelled antibody in tumour-free animals were studied and the resulting bone marrow dose was estimated. When the mice were treated with 211At-labelled antibody 9 out of 10 mice were free of macro- and microscopic tumour compared to 3 out of 10 when Iodine-131 was used. The equivalent dose to the bone marrow was 2.4-3.1 Sv from 211At- and 3.4-4.1 Sv from 131I-irradiation. The therapeutic efficacy of 211At-labelled specific antibody is very good and, at approximately equivalent bone marrow doses, better than that of 131I

The performance of such detectors in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is discussed. This work provides the first reported measurements using boron-coated silicon diode arrays as microdosimeters in BNCT. Results are in good agreement with measurements with gas proportional counters. Various boron-coating options are investigated along with device orientation effects. Finally, a 235U coating is tested to simulate the behavior of the device in a heavy-ion therapy beam

Open questions still remain concerning magnitude, persistence and control of the cell cycle inhibition after high-LET exposure. The intention of this review is to focus on the cell cycle distribution of the irradiated populations and the cell systems used (normal vs. mutant and tumor cells). The relevant published data are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing isodoses, high-LET irradiation is a more potent inducer of cell cycle delays than low-LET irradiation. Generally, more pronounced delays in S- and G2-phase have been observed with increasing LET. The role of TP53 in relation to these effects is still controversial. A dose- and LET- dependent increase in cells arrested in G1-phase has as well been observed. Studies are presented indicating that a large fraction of normal fibroblasts irradiated in G1-phase and reseeded after exposure, did not re-enter the cell cycle but remained permanently arrested. The expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in this case appeared more pronounced at high LET, but no fundamental differences were observed between low- and high-LET irradiation	
2445	Geometric parameters of clinical electron beams	Computers, Electrons, Head, Humans, Mathematics, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Vacuum	The influence of different components in the treatment head of a therapy accelerator on the geometric properties of the delivered electron beams have been analysed based on the theory of small angle multiple scattering. The analyses show that it is possible to define and compute the properties of an effective electron source which, when placed in vacuum at some distance from the patient, produces exactly the same electron fluence at the patient as the real beam. The effective source is fully described by three parameters: its angular spread, its radial width and the distance from the patient. A numerical example indicates that the half width of the effective source could be considerable, often as large as 10 cm or more at low energies

The collimator replaces the conventional treatment head of a Philips SL series linear accelerator and comprises 80 tungsten leaves and two orthogonal pairs of back-up collimators. Each leaf projects a width of 1 cm in the isocentric plane, allowing shaped photon treatment beams of up to 40 cm square. The performance of the prototype and first production model have been thoroughly tested against the design specifications and the requirements of IEC standards. Radiation attenuation by the collimator components has been measured and substantially exceeds those requirements. The irregular portion of a field (shielded by the leaves only) receives, on average, a dose of less than 2% of the tumour dose. The effect on the penumbra of using leaves which translate linearly and have curved faces has been assessed and found not to degrade the sharpness of the beam fall-off significantly. The reproducibility of the video system used in positioning the leaves has been measured and gave a root mean square deviation of less than 0.3 mm in repeat setting of a 10 cm square field, and an accuracy always within 1 mm. The rationale for clinical use of the device is discussed and its effect on treatment quality control and reliability, is considered	
2141	Successful conversion from a linear accelerator-based program to a Gamma Knife radiosurgery program: the Cleveland Clinic experience	Brain Neoplasms/cl [Classification], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Ohio, Oncology Service,Hospital/og [Organization & Administration], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology/og [Organization & Administration], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies, Surgery Department,Hospital/og [Organization & Administration]	From August 1989 to January 1997, 307 treatments in 293 patients were performed with a linear accelerator-based (LINAC) stereotactic radiosurgery system. Because of the program s success, the need for a dedicated radiosurgery unit in Ohio and the desire to treat functional disorders, the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) obtained the first Gamma Knife in the state of Ohio. Based on the previous volume of patients for radiosurgery, it was estimated that 75-100 patients would be treated during the first year of operation. However, during the first calendar year, 214 treatments were performed on 205 patients, which far exceeded expectations. The success of the CCHS Gamma Knife Center can be attributed to an increase in a number of factors. These included marketing efforts, patient awareness, increased use for functional disorders, physician understanding of radiosurgery, use by qualified nonaffiliated radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons, and outpatient delivery (95% with the Gamma Knife vs <5% with the LINAC). With proper planning, education, and awareness, the opening of a Gamma Knife Center can greatly increase the volume of radiosurgery performed when compared with a LINAC-based program

Different approaches of RIT such as injection of a stable radioimmunoconjugate or the use of pretargeting are available. The choice of the radionuclide used for RIT depends on its radiation characteristics with respect to the malignancy or cells targeted. beta-Emitters with their lower energy and longer path length are more suitable for targeting bulky, solid tumors, whereas alpha-emitters with their high linear energy transfer and short path length are better suited to target cells or tumors of the hematologic system. Encouraging results have been obtained using these approaches treating patients with hematologic malignancies. While the results in solid tumors are somewhat less favorable, new strategies for patients with minimal residual disease (MRD), using adjuvant and locoregional treatment, are currently being investigated. In this report, we outline basic principles of RIT, give an overview of available radioimmunoconjugates and their clinical applications with special emphasis on their use in hematologic malignancies, including use in conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation (SCT).

The median follow-up was 5.4 years, and no patient was lost to follow-up. All tumors showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 35% and 20/100 or better in 58%. Eight eyes were enucleated because of complications. Metastasis developed in 26 patients (20.5%) from 3 months to 7 years after treatment. Results indicate that proton irradiation is quite successful for achieving local control of uveal melanomas. A large proportion of the treated eyes maintained useful vision. Five-year follow-up data indicate that proton irradiation has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastasis	
531	[Prostate localization systems for prostate radiotherapy]. [Review] [69 refs] [French]	Humans, Male, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostate/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Urinary Bladder/ah [Anatomy & Histology]	The development of sophisticated conformal radiation therapy techniques for prostate cancer, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, implies precise and accurate targeting. Inter- and intrafraction prostate motion can be significant and should be characterized, unless the target volume may occasionally be missed. Indeed, bony landmark-based portal imaging does not provide the positional information for soft-tissue targets (prostate and seminal vesicles) or critical organs (rectum and bladder). In this article, we describe various prostate localization systems used before or during the fraction: rectal balloon, intraprostatic fiducials, ultrasound-based localization, integrated CT/linear accelerator system, megavoltage or kilovoltage cone-beam CT, Calypso 4D localization system tomotherapy, Cyberknife and Exactrac X-Ray 6D. The clinical benefit in using such prostate localization tools is not proven by randomized studies and the feasibility has just been established for some of these techniques. Nevertheless, these systems should improve local control by a more accurate delivery of an increased prescribed dose in a reduced planning target volume. [References: 69]

2128	Kinetics of formation of exchanges and rejoining of breaks in human G0 and G2 lymphocytes after low-LET radiation	Adult, Animals, CHO Cells, Chromosome Aberrations, Cricetinae, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, G0 Phase/re [Radiation Effects], G2 Phase/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Humans, Interphase, Kinetics, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/me [Metabolism], Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Metaphase, Radiation, Research, Safety, Sister Chromatid Exchange/re [Radiation Effects], Time	PURPOSE: To study the kinetics of chromosomal break rejoining and exchange formation in human G0 and G2 lymphocytes after low-LET irradiation using the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique. METHODS: For the G0 experiments, isolated human lymphocytes were irradiated (1, 3 and 8 Gy) and immediate and delayed fusions (1, 3, 5, 8 and 24 h) were performed with CHO-cells, and 48-h cultures were set up simultaneously. Interphase and metaphase human chromosomes were hybridized with dual colour combination probes for chromosomes 2 and 4. For the G2 experiments, isolated lymphocytes from the same donor were cultured for 69 h, irradiated with 3 Gy 60Co gamma rays and fused with CHO cells immediately and after 1, 2 and 3 h. Chromatid breaks and exchanges were scored after Giemsa staining. RESULTS: In both G0 and G2 cells, exchanges were already observed at the first fusion and, at lower doses, their frequencies remained relatively stable over time. The exchange-type aberrations seen in G0 cells were mostly incomplete, especially in the first fusions, while the exchanges seen in metaphase were mostly complete. The frequency of complete exchanges increased by time during incubation, while the frequency of incomplete exchanges showed more variation and a general decline by time in the G0-PCC experiment. The number of breaks declined rapidly by time both in G0 and G2. The break rejoining rate was higher at 8 Gy than in the two lower doses in the G0-PCC. The overall aberration frequencies in G0 and G2 cells studied by PCC were higher than in the corresponding metaphase. The initial number of breaks in G2 was higher than in G0 and the break rejoining rate in the G2 was two-fold. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of complete exchanges in G0 is a delayed process. The incomplete exchanges appear unstable in G0. The decreasing proportion of incomplete exchanges and simultaneous increase in complete exchanges in G0-PCC indicates that formation of exchanges is not coordinated in time

447	Effect of anatomic motion on proton therapy dose distributions in prostate cancer treatment	Calibration, Femur Head/ra [Radiography], Humans, Male, Motion, Movement, Physics, Prostate, Prostate/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Rectum/ra [Radiography], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Urinary Bladder/ra [Radiography]	PURPOSE: To determine the dosimetric impact of interfraction anatomic movements in prostate cancer patients receiving proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities

Based upon data showing that the vast majority of the recurrences occur within and surrounding the original tumor site and in order to reduce the morbidity of whole breast radiotherapy and to give the treatment in a shorter time, partial breast irradiation has been developed by several institutions. Partial breast radiotherapy is given by intraoperative radiotherapy (photons or electrons), or brachytherapy (low dose rate or high dose rate) or external radiotherapy using 3D conformal radiation therapy. This is a review of the literature data on this topic. [References: 33]

Two phase I/II clinical studies on the carbon beam radiation treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were carried out in our institution from October 1996 to February 1999. The dose-limiting toxicity was found to be radiation pneumonia. In the first protocol, 47 patients received 18 fractions of increasing doses from 59.4 GyE by 10% over 6 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was found to be 95.4 GyE, while the complete tumor control dose was 85.6 GyE. In the second protocol, 34 patients received 9 fractions of in creasing doses from 68.4 GyE by 5% over 3 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was 79.2 GyE, and the complete tumor control dose was > 68.9 GyE. The 4-year survival rate estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 56% for patients receiving the first protocol. Because a higher local control rate was achieved in the second protocol, the 5-year survival rate is estimated to be higher and similar to that achieved after surgery. Another phase II clinical study in patients with stage INSCLC is ongoing. Heavy-particle radiotherapy is a new modality for the treatment of lung cancer which holds promise for the 21st century.

1113	The EORTC ophthalmic oncology quality of life questionnaire module (EORTC QLQ-OPT30). Development and pre-testing (Phase I-III)	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Automobile Driving, Brachytherapy, Eye Diseases/co [Complications], Female, Headache/co [Complications], Humans, Knowledge, Male, Melanoma/co [Complications], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Quality of Life, Questionnaires, Radiotherapy, Reading, Recurrence, Research, Sweden, Uveal Neoplasms/co [Complications], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision Disorders/co [Complications]	AIMS: The research objective was to develop a questionnaire module to be used, in addition to the European Organisation into Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, for measurement of quality of life (QL) among patients with uveal melanoma treated with methods such as transpupillary thermotherapy, plaque radiotherapy, proton beam radiotherapy, local resection, and enucleation. The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. METHODS: Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. RESULTS: The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research	
321	Reduced neutron production through use of a flattening-filter-free accelerator	Filtration/is [Instrumentation], Gold, Humans, Male, Neutrons, Occupational Exposure/pc [Prevention & Control], Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Research, Risk	PURPOSE: To measure and compare neutron fluence around an accelerator operating at 18 MV, both with the flattening filter present (FF mode) and absent (flattening-filter-free [FFF] mode). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The neutron fluence was measured at several locations in the patient plane using gold foil activation in neutron moderators. Differences in neutron fluence between the FF and FFF mode were assessed in three frameworks: (1) measured per monitor unit of machine-on time, (2) determined per dose on the central axis, and (3) determined for a complete course of prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy. RESULTS: Neutron fluence per monitor unit was approximately 20% lower when the accelerator was operated in the FFF mode than when it was in FF mode. The total amount of neutron fluence that would be obtained during the entire course of prostate intensity-modulate radiotherapy was 69% lower when the accelerator was operated in the FFF mode than when it was in the FF mode. This reduction in neutron fluence would correspond to a drastic reduction in the neutron dose equivalent received by the patient as a byproduct of high-energy radiotherapy. It would also correspond to a reduction in activation within the treatment vault and subsequent exposure to radiation therapists. CONCLUSION: When feasible, operating the accelerator without a FF will benefit both patients and radiation therapists by reducing the number of unwanted neutrons and resultant exposure. This reduces the risk of negative effects from such exposure (e.g., second cancers)	
3934	A technique for treating local breast cancer using a single set-up point and asymmetric collimation	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Jaw, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	Using both pairs of asymmetric jaws of a linear accelerator local-regional breast cancer may be treated from a single set-up point. This point is placed at the abutment of the supraclavicular fields with the medial and lateral tangential fields. Positioning the jaws to create a half-beam superiorly permits treatment of the supraclavicular field. Positioning both jaws asymmetrically at midline to define a single beam in the inferoanterior quadrant permits treatment of the breast from medial and lateral tangents. The highest possible matching accuracy between the supraclavicular and tangential fields is inherently provided by this technique. For treatment of all fields at 100 cm source to axis distance (SAD) the lateral placement and depth of the set-up point may be determined by simulation and simple trigonometry. We elaborate on the clinical procedure. For the technologists treatment of all fields from a single set-up point is simple and efficient. Since the tissue at the superior border of the tangential fields is generally firmer than in mid-breast, greater accuracy in day-to-day set-up is permitted. This technique eliminates the need for table angles even when tangential fields only are planned. Because of half-beam collimation the limit to the tangential field length is 20 cm. Means will be suggested to overcome this limitation in the few cases where it occurs. Another modification is suggested for linear accelerators with only one independent pair of jaws	
597	A Monte Carlo based three-dimensional dose reconstruction method derived from portal dose images	Algorithms, Film Dosimetry, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional/mt [Methods], Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods]	The verification of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is necessary for adequate quality control of the treatment. Pretreatment verification may trace the possible differences between the planned dose and the actual dose delivered to the patient. To estimate the impact of differences between planned and delivered photon beams, a three-dimensional (3-D) dose verification method has been developed that reconstructs the dose inside a phantom. The pretreatment procedure is based on portal dose images measured with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) of the separate beams, without the phantom in the beam and a 3-D dose calculation engine based on the Monte Carlo calculation. Measured gray scale portal images are converted into portal dose images. From these images the lateral scattered dose in the EPID is subtracted and the image is converted into energy fluence. Subsequently, a phase-space distribution is sampled from the energy fluence and a 3-D dose calculation in a phantom is started based on a Monte Carlo dose engine. The reconstruction model is compared to film and ionization chamber measurements for various field sizes. The reconstruction algorithm is also tested for an IMRT plan using 10 MV photons delivered to a phantom and measured using films at several depths in the phantom. Depth dose curves for both 6 and 10 MV photons are reconstructed with a maximum error generally smaller than 1% at depths larger than the buildup region, and smaller than 2% for the off-axis profiles, excluding the penumbra region. The absolute dose values are reconstructed to within 1.5% for square field sizes ranging from 5 to 20 cm width. For the IMRT plan, the dose was reconstructed and compared to the dose distribution with film using the gamma evaluation, with a 3% and 3 mm criterion. 99% of the pixels inside the irradiated field had a gamma value smaller than one. The absolute dose at the isocenter agreed to within 1% with the dose measured with an ionization chamber. It can be concluded that our new dose reconstruction algorithm is able to reconstruct the 3-D dose distribution in phantoms with a high accuracy. This result is obtained by combining portal dose images measured prior to treatment with an accurate dose calculation engine	
800	Biological weighted effective dose in 205 MeV clinical proton beam	Animals, Body Burden, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Biological, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research	The contribution of high linear energy transfer (L) charged particles to dosimetric and microdosimetric characteristics in a clinical proton beam was experimentally studied using an ionization chamber and track etched detectors. The particles mentioned are produced by proton nuclear interactions; at the Bragg peak region slowed down protons also contribute in the L region above several keV microm(-1). Due to these particles the biological weighted effective dose (BWED) of the beam changes with depth. The spectra of particles with L above 7 keV microm(-1) were established by means of track etched detectors, which permitted us to determine their contribution to dosimetric and microdosimetric characteristics of clinical proton beams. The studies were realized in the clinical proton beam of the JINR Dubna Phasotron, with a primary energy of 205 MeV. The relative contribution to the absorbed dose of the particles with L above 7 keV microm(-1) increases from several per cent at the beam entrance to several tens of per cent at the Bragg peak region. The relative biological weighted efficiency (RBWE) for radiotherapy has been calculated using a biological weighting function. It increases with depth from 1.02 at the beam entrance to about 1.25 at the Bragg peak region	
455	The influence of metal artefacts on the range of ion beams	Artifacts, Biophysics, Dental Implants, Germany, Gold, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Metals, Pelvic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Prostheses and Implants, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]	The influence of artefacts due to metal implants on the range of ion beams is investigated, using a geometrically well-defined head and pelvic phantom together with inserts from steel, titanium and tungsten. The ranges along various beam paths including artefacts were calculated from the TPS and compared to known calculations for phantoms without any insert. In the head phantom, beams intersecting the streak artefacts lead to errors in the range of around or below 1%, which is mainly due to a cancellation of various effects. Beams through the metal or close to it show an underestimation of 3.5% of the range for tungsten. For the pelvic phantom, a large underestimation of the range is observed for a lateral path through the metal insert. In the case of tungsten and steel, range errors of -5% and -18% are observed, respectively. Such beam paths are typically used for pelvic tumours in radiotherapy with ion beams. For beams in the anterior-posterior direction through the inserts, an overestimation of ion ranges of up to 3% for titanium and 8% for steel is expected, respectively. Beam paths outside the metal insert show a large cancellation for the lateral beams (leading to errors of around 1% only) and somewhat higher errors for anterior-posterior beams (around 3% for titanium and 6% for steel). The analysis of CT data of patients with dental implants of gold as compared to patients with healthy teeth also showed a significant effect of the artefacts on the distribution of HU in the data, namely a redistribution of HU to higher and lower values as compared to patients with healthy teeth. The corresponding mean range variation was a 2.5% reduction in the data with artefacts as compared to the data without artefacts. It is concluded that beam paths through metal implants should generally be avoided in proton and ion therapy. In this case, the underestimation of ion range due to artefacts alone may amount to 3% for dental fillings and up to 5% and 18% for hip prosthesis made of titanium and steel, respectively. It is important to note that the size of the metal inserts cannot be determined correctly from the images, so that a correction of the ranges in metal also leads to large uncertainties. Finally, it should be stressed that the stated relative deviations are strictly valid only for the investigated phantoms and can only give a rough estimate on the size of range uncertainties that may appear in real patients

Gamma-beam therapy was of one type. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival rates in patients treated by combined radiotherapy including intracavitary gamma-beam therapy based on the principle of successive administration of low or high activity radionuclides. However, the survival rate in them as compared to that in patients treated by intracavitary irradiation of common type, was much higher. Rectal complications were most frequent in patients treated by routine radiotherapy, bladder complications were noted in patients treated by successive administration of high activity radionuclide sources	
2861	Characteristics of an MM 22 medical microtron 6-MV photon beam	Acceleration, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic	Instrument AB Scanditronix offers a 6-MV therapeutic photon beam as an option with the 22-MeV medical microtron (MM 22). The method of acceleration, target assembly, and use of two flattening filters produce beams having several characteristics (e.g., field flatness, penetration, and intensity) that are superior to many 6-MV Linac beams.

1032	The design, construction and performance of a variable collimator for epithermal neutron capture therapy beams	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Humans, Lead, Lithium, Massachusetts, Monte Carlo Method, Neutrons, Optics, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Research, Software	A patient collimator for the fission converter based epithermal neutron beam (FCB) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor (MITR-II) was built for clinical trials of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). A design was optimized by Monte Carlo simulations of the entire beam line and incorporates a modular construction for easy modifications in the future. The device was formed in-house by casting a mixture of lead spheres (7.6 mm diameter) in epoxy resin loaded with either 140 mg cm(-3) of boron carbide or 210 mg cm(-3) of lithium fluoride (95% enriched in 6Li). The cone shaped collimator allows easy field placement anywhere on the patient and is equipped with a laser indicator of central axis, beam's eye view optics and circular apertures of 80, 100, 120 and 160 mm diameter. Beam profiles and the collateral dose in a half-body phantom were measured for the 160 mm field using fission counters, activation foils as well as tissue equivalent (A-150) and graphite walled ionization chambers. Leakage radiation through the collimator contributes less than 10% to the total collateral dose up to 0.15 m beyond the edge of the aperture and becomes relatively more prominent with lateral displacement. The measured whole body dose equivalent of 24 +/- 2 mSv per Gy of therapeutic dose is comparable to doses received during conventional therapy and is due principally (60-80%) to thermal neutron capture reactions with boron. These findings, together with the dose distributions for the primary beam, demonstrate the suitability of this patient collimator for BNCT	
2446	Radiotherapeutic computed tomography with scanned photon beams	Acceleration, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Thorax, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], X-Rays	Radiotherapeutic computed tomography is a powerful technique to generate anatomical transversal tomograms of the patient in treatment position by using the therapy beam from the treatment unit. For this purpose the treatment unit has to be equipped with a detector array that can detect the beam transmitted through the patient and a computer that analyzes the data and performs the back projection. When the treatment unit uses scanned elementary photon beams, the only practical technique available for generating high quality high energy photon beams, the operation principle and, to some extent, the image quality is similar to that of a 3rd generation CT-scanner. The optimum choice of detection geometry and type of radiation detectors for radiotherapeutic computed tomography particularly at high photon energies are discussed indicating the merits of BGO (bismuthgermanate) or CWO (cadmiumtungstate) photodiod arrays. The first tomographic images of a thorax phantom at an acceleration potential of 50 MV using such detectors are presented. The image contrast is similar to that for 300 kV X rays mainly because the considerable influence of pair production at 50 MV. Line spread and modulation transfer functions are presented indicating a resolution of the order of two millimeters using a crystal thickness of 5 mm. The advantages with radiotherapeutic computed tomography, beside forming a new general communication channel between different diagnostic techniques, dose planning, and radiation delivery, are the elimination of position errors and the provision of exact attenuation data for dose planning

Among the 4 eligible randomized studies including non-small-cell lung cancer patients in complete remission of stage II (N1) disease, none demonstrated a significant advantage on survival. In addition, some of these studies disclosed an apparently deleterious effect after postoperative radiotherpy. Although the modalities and the technical quality of radiotherapy and surgical resection were different for the different studies or within a given study, or in some of the older studies even obsolete, and although the precision of the outcome evaluation can be criticized, there is currently no argument for proposing postoperative radiotherapy as a routine systematic practice with conventional methods of bidimensional dosimetric planification after complete surgical resection with good quality mediastinal node dissection for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with stage II (N1) disease. However, the contribution of postoperative radiotherpy with sufficient means for performing tridimensional conformational radiotherapy with individual optimization of computerized dosimetric planification taking into account the residual respiratory function after surgery remains to be evaluated in randomized prospective studies with rigorous control of the technical quality of the surgical resection and the radiotherapy and a precise statistical analysis of the locoregional and distant events in case of incomplete surgical resection and in more advanced stage disease (parietal T3, N0, stage III N2)

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 426 ciliochoroidal melanomas that met COMS inclusion criteria for randomisation to enucleation versus radioactive plaque but were treated with either helium ions or 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: At 3 years 36.0% of eyes had 6/12 or better visual acuity. The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision

Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable

For the applicators 6 X 6 to 25 X 25 cm size, the leakage was measured in the plane of the patient and on the sides of the applicators with the available electron energies of 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 MeV. The levels were significant. The highest leakage on the side was for the combination of 6 X 6-cm applicator and 9-MeV electrons (32%) and in the plane of the patient for 25 X 25-cm applicator with 18 MeV (10%) relative to the peak dose. Adding lead 1-2 mm, at appropriate locations inside the applicators has reduced the leakages to acceptable levels without affecting the beam parameters

We described in this study the first case of petrousal bone apex chondroblastoma. METHODS: The tumor occurred in a 12-year-old girl and was revealed by left hypoacusis, vertigo, and walking instability. Computerized tomography scan depicted well-demarcated and osteolytic lesion of the left petrousal bone just before the internal acoustic meatus. The tumor was operated on by a subtemporal approach with a subtotal resection. Lesion recurred and was operated a second time by a combined approach subtemporal and translabyrinthine. This treatment was completed by radiotherapy. We used a combination of photon therapy and proton therapy. Outcome was good and free of recurrence 36 months after the second operation. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy can be particularly useful for skull base tumors frequently radioresistant and near very important structures. This case is the first one of a successful treatment by proton therapy for chondroblastoma recurrence	
1494	Optimized treatment planning for prostate cancer comparing IMPT, VHEET and 15 MV IMXT	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality Control, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	The merits of intensity-modulated very-high energy electron therapy (VHEET) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in relation to intensity-modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT) with respect to the treatment of the prostate have been quantified. Optimized dose distributions were designed for 5-11 beams of 250 MeV VHEET and 15 MV IMXT as well as 1-9 beam ports of IMPT. In the case of the comparison between 250 MeV VHEET and 15 MV IMXT, it was found that the quality of target coverage achievable with VHEET was comparable to or sometimes better than that provided by IMXT. However, VHEET provided an improvement over IMXT in the dose sparing of the sensitive structures and normal tissues. Compared to IMXT, VHEET decreased the mean rectal dose and bladder dose by up to 10% of the prescribed target dose, while reducing by up to 12% of the prescribed target dose the integral dose to normal tissues. In quantifying the merits of IMPT relative to IMXT, it was found that using intensity-modulated proton beams for inverse planning instead of intensity-modulated photon beams improved target dose homogeneity by up to 1.3% of the prescribed target dose, while reducing the mean rectal dose, bladder dose, and normal tissue integral dose by up to 27%, 30% and 28% of the prescribed target dose respectively. The comparison of optimized planning for IMPT and VHEET showed that the quality of target coverage achievable with IMPT is comparable to or better (by up to 1.3% of the prescribed target dose) than that provided by VHEET. Compared to VHEET, IMPT delivered a mean rectal dose and a bladder dose that was lower by up to 17% and 23% of prescribed target dose respectively, and also reduced the integral dose to normal tissues by up to 17% of the prescribed target dose. These results indicate that of the three modalities the greatest dose escalation will be possible with IMPT, then VHEET, and then IMXT. It follows that IMPT will result in the highest probability of complication-free tumour control, while IMXT will provide the lowest probability	
4404	RBE in fast neutron therapy and in boron neutron capture therapy. A useful concept or a misuse?	Alpha Particles, Belgium, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Neutron Capture Therapy, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Relative Biological Effectiveness	In high-LET radiation therapy, radiation quality and radiation quality differences have to be taken into account and specified. In fast neutron therapy, an operational approach has been adopted which is based on the concept of "clinical RBE". The paper discusses the quantities of RBE (relative biological effectiveness), reference RBE and clinical RBE and their relationship and significance in radiation therapy. In particular, the difference between the well defined RBE in radiation biology and the clinical RBE which is based on the judgement of radiotherapists is elucidated and emphasized. The clinical RBE is based on the reference RBE and implicitly includes differences in physical selectivity of the irradiation beams and clinical experience. The particular aspects of radiation quality in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) are due to the poor penetration of the primary beam, the inhomogeneity of the spatial distribution of 10B nuclides in the irradiated tissue and the short range of the alpha-particles emitted after neutron capture in 10B. The related problems in accounting for radiation quality in BNCT and in the applicability of the clinical RBE concept are discussed

The effect on these parameters of filtering the beams with either pure polyethylene, polyethylene loaded with 5% boron, or polyethylene loaded with 10% lithium was studied. A 4-cm, 10% lithiated filter used with a 26-MeV proton beam was selected for therapeutic use. Buildup curves, beam profiles at several transverse planes for different field sizes, and comparison of beam profiles with 60Co are given	
2831	Brachytherapy in primary ocular tumors.[erratum appears in Semin Surg Oncol 1997 Nov-Dec;13(6):466]. [Review] [47 refs]	Adult, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Eye, Eye Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Eye Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Incidence, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pennsylvania, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Recurrence, Retinoblastoma/mo [Mortality], Retinoblastoma/pa [Pathology], Retinoblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Visual Acuity	Patients with primary ocular tumors are seen infrequently in the medical profession, and most of these patients are referred to specialty centers which has resulted in a good study population. In the past, ocular tumors were treated with enucleation, but the current emphasis is now on organ preservation with sparing of all or partial visual acuity. In the management of these tumors, plaque brachytherapy and particle beam therapy have been used more frequently as an alternative to enucleation. A multi-institutional study, the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), is currently underway, organized by the National Eye Institute. The COMS isotope of choice is Iodine-125 (I-125). Recurrence after plaque therapy is approximately 15%, although it may be as high as 37% at 15 years for metastatic disease. In one study, nondiffuse iris melanoma has been controlled in 93% of patients by custom plaques utilizing I-125. Plaque brachytherapy also utilizes I-125 for the treatment of retinoblastoma tumors either as primary therapy or following external beam radiation. Currently, through the utilization of plaque radiation therapy, enucleation may be avoided in the majority of patients, and many patients may retrieve some visual acuity. We will review plaque brachytherapy techniques, diagnosis, staging, and some of the pertinent literature of the two most frequently encountered primary ocular tumors: choroidal melanoma, sometimes referred to as uveal melanoma, with an incidence of approximately 1,500 new cases per year in the adult population; and retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular primary malignancy found in childhood, with a frequency of approximately 250 [corrected] new cases per year.

1457	Two-dimensional pencil beam scaling: an improved proton dose algorithm for heterogeneous media	Air, Algorithms, Anatomy, Germany, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Protons, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time, Time Factors, Water	New dose delivery techniques with proton beams, such as beam spot scanning or raster scanning, require fast and accurate dose algorithms which can be applied for treatment plan optimization in clinically acceptable timescales. The clinically required accuracy is particularly difficult to achieve for the irradiation of complex, heterogeneous regions of the patient's anatomy. Currently applied fast pencil beam dose calculations based on the standard inhomogeneity correction of pathlength scaling often cannot provide the accuracy required for clinically acceptable dose distributions. This could be achieved with sophisticated Monte Carlo simulations which are still unacceptably time consuming for use as dose engines in optimization calculations. We therefore present a new algorithm for proton dose calculations which aims to resolve the inherent problem between calculation speed and required clinical accuracy. First, a detailed derivation of the new concept, which is based on an additional scaling of the lateral proton fluence is provided. Then, the newly devised two-dimensional (2D) scaling method is tested for various geometries of different phantom materials. These include standard biological tissues such as bone, muscle and fat as well as air. A detailed comparison of the new 2D pencil beam scaling with the current standard pencil beam approach and Monte Carlo simulations, performed with GEANT, is presented. It was found that the new concept proposed allows calculation of absorbed dose with an accuracy almost equal to that achievable with Monte Carlo simulations while requiring only modestly increased calculation times in comparison to the standard pencil beam approach. It is believed that this new proton dose algorithm has the potential to significantly improve the treatment planning outcome for many clinical cases encountered in highly conformal proton therapy	
2783	Study on the repair of the radioinduced lesions involved in the formation of chromosomal aberrations in G0 human lymphocytes after exposure to gamma-rays and fast neutrons	Cell Cycle, Chromosome Aberrations, Cytarabine/pd [Pharmacology], DNA, DNA Repair, DNA Repair/de [Drug Effects], DNA Repair/re [Radiation Effects], Fast Neutrons, Gamma Rays, Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Neutrons, Radiation, Research, Time	Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), an inhibitor of DNA synthesis and repair, has been used to study the mechanisms of formation of chromosomal aberrations after exposure to low- and high-LET radiation. When G0 human lymphocytes were exposed either to gamma-rays or to d(50 MeV)-Be neutrons and immediately treated with ara-C for increasing periods of time, the frequency of aberrations (dicentrics) increased sharply. For gamma-rays, the enhancement increased with the duration of the treatment up to 5 h, whereas for neutrons, an ara-C treatment lasting for 5 h was no more effective than treatment for 3 h. These results were confirmed by the second experiment in which ara-C was administered for 3 h with an increasing time delay following irradiation. Since no increase in the dicentric frequency was observed when ara-C was administered 5 h after gamma-irradiation, it is suggested that the induced breaks rejoined within that time. For neutrons, the data were conflicting since the repair was completed within 3 h after a dose of 0.5 Gy, and in approximately 5 h after a dose of 2.0 Gy. From both experiments, it appears that gamma-rays and fast neutrons produce similar types of lesions, as ara-C increased the frequencies of aberrations induced by both types of radiation. However, the ara-C treatment resulted in a smaller increase in aberrations following neutron irradiation. According to the enzymatic nature of break formation and the mode of action of ara-C on the polymerase activity, it is suggested that, in addition to double-strand breaks, single-strand breaks could be the lesions involved in the repair processes inhibited by ara-C. Single-strand breaks formed directly or by secondary reactions would, therefore, be one of the major lesions responsible for the aberrations produced by gamma and neutron radiations	
211	High-dose external beam radiation for localized prostate cancer: current status and future challenges. [Review] [42 refs]	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Treatment Failure	Since the 1960s, external beam radiation has been one of the major curative treatment options for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Efforts to improve the efficacy of this modality have focused on delivering a higher dose, and several recent randomized trials have confirmed that this higher dose results in improved oncological outcomes, particularly for patients with intermediate-risk disease. Technological advancements over the past 2 decades have allowed highly conformal treatments that spare more normal tissue and reduce early and long-term treatment side effects. In a complementary fashion, methods have been developed for better real-time localization of the prostate such that radiation fields can be shifted before each treatment to match the daily shifts in the position of the target, leading to greater accuracy and allowing for smaller treatment margins that in turn will overlap with less normal tissue. With newer and more expensive technologies such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy and protons being used with increasing frequency for the treatment of prostate cancer, it becomes imperative to study the risks and benefits of each new modality so that informed cost-benefit decisions can be made. Similarly, there has been a growing interest in hypofractionation as a means of exploiting the supposed low alpha/beta ratio of prostate cancer to shorten overall treatment time and thereby improve convenience and lower costs. However, as with any new technology, it is necessary to proceed with caution in the arena of hypofractionation while we await the results of trials that will help us to determine the long-term risks and benefits of hypofractionation and whether biological assumptions about the underlying alpha/beta ratio can translate into a true clinical advantage.

849	Cellular parameters and RBE-LET dependences for modelling heavy-ion radiotherapy	Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Helium, Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Models,Theoretical, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Relative Biological Effectiveness	Sets of four parameters (m, E0, sigma0 and kappa) of the cellular track structure model of Katz have been fitted to recently published data concerning human melanoma (AA) and mammalian (V79) cells exposed to a variety of lighter ions and to mixed ion-Co60 and ion-ion irradiation. Using these parameters, model predictions of V79 survival were verified against experimental data. RBE-LET dependences were calculated and compared with experimental data obtained for V79 cells after exposure to 3He, 12C and 20Ne ion beams. The presented track-segment approach used in track structure calculations, while satisfactory for heavier ions, may be of limited value for predicting the RBE-LET dependence of proton and helium radiotherapy beams in regions close to the distal range of these particles. We discuss the predictive capability of this model and propose standards in reporting cellular radiobiology data for application in modelling heavy ion beam radiotherapy

[Russian]	Adult, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Chemical Industry, Chromosome Aberrations/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Gamma Rays, Gamma Rays/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], Male, Middle Aged, Plutonium, Radiation	The origin of multiaberrant cells (MACs) was studied by comparing the structure and intensity of chromosome damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of two groups of people: workers of Siberian Chemical Plant differing in the content of plutonium-239 in their bodies, and inhabitants of a non-polluted settlement (control group). Plutonium-239 is known to be a long-lived densely-ionizing source of alpha-radiation with high linear energy delivery; therefore, it has a stronger effect on cell hereditary structures than gamma-rays. In persons with the content of plutonium-239 higher than 13 nCu, the frequency of MAC was 0.105% which at least tenfold exceeds the spontaneous level. The chromosome-type aberrations that are usually induced by ionizing radiation predominated in MACs. Our results suggest that MAC formation may be caused by internal body irradiation with the incorporated sources of densely-ionizing radiation

The c-kit protein is found in normal cutaneous and choroidal melanocytes, and there is evidence that expression is lost in melanoma. Expression of c-kit was analysed in 57 paraffin-embedded sections of choroidal melanoma specimens and three choroidal melanoma cell lines using immunochemistry and Western blotting. Of the tumour specimens, 75% stained positively for c-kit with a membrane pattern of reactivity. Of the six patients who underwent proton beam therapy before enucleation, five tumours exhibited no c-kit immunoreactivity and the other tumour demonstrated weak staining. Of the three melanoma cell lines used, c-kit expression was observed in only one. No correlations between c-kit positivity and parameters such as cell type, largest macroscopic tumour dimension, scleral invasion or pigmentation were observed. In contrast, a significant positive association was found between c-kit staining and mitotic activity (P = 0.02). However, c-kit expression did not significantly influence survival when evaluated by univariate analysis. In conclusion, c-kit is expressed in most choroidal melanoma tumours. Further analysis should provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the molecular and cellular changes in choroidal melanomas

Hence, an improved clinical benefit is to be expected predominantly in large, hypoxic and slowly growing tumors. Since a short course of radiotherapy is required for clinical reasons, it prompted the authors to initiate a randomly controlled trial on locally advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 1999, 27 patients with locally advanced breast cancer were irradiated with photons (60 Gy, 30 fractions; 8 MV, (60)Co) or neutrons (18 Gy, twelve fractions; 66 MeV(p-->Be)). The mean tumor diameters were 699 +/- 399 ml for the photon group and 1,097 +/- 831 ml in the neutron group. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 21.5 months tumor involution was evaluated in 22 patients. Partial and complete remissions were registered in 6/10 patients of the photon group and 5/12 patients of the neutron group. Late grade 3-4 morbidity according to RTOG definition was scored in 5/10 patients in the photon group and in 6/12 patients in the neutron group. With regard to tumor control and late radiation morbidity no differences between the two treatment arms were observed. CONCLUSION: The underlying data indicate that no benefit is to be expected from neutron therapy in breast cancer	
2104	Dose calculation models for proton treatment planning using a dynamic beam delivery system: an attempt to include density heterogeneity effects in the analytical dose calculation	Algorithms, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Switzerland, Time	The gantry for proton radiotherapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is designed specifically for the spot-scanning technique. Use of this technique to its full potential requires dose calculation algorithms which are capable of precisely simulating each scanned beam individually. Different specialized analytical dose calculations have been developed, which attempt to model the effects of density heterogeneities in the patient's body on the dose. Their accuracy has been evaluated by a comparison with Monte Carlo calculated dose distributions in the case of a simple geometrical density interface parallel to the beam and typical anatomical situations. A specialized ray casting model which takes range dilution effects (broadening of the spectrum of proton ranges) into account has been found to produce results of good accuracy. This algorithm can easily be implemented in the iterative optimization procedure used for the calculation of the optimal contribution of each individual scanned pencil beam. In most cases an elemental pencil beam dose calculation has been found to be most accurate. Due to the long computing time, this model is currently used only after the optimization procedure as an alternative method of calculating the dose

Three ways of solving the clinical problems of anoxic tumor cells are today being tried. Hyperbaric oxygen breathing before and during irradiation; using fast neutrons and thirdly the use of improved treatment schemes with low LET (i.e. low alpha-value) radiation. The various methods are described and critically evaluated. Calculations are made with the two-component model of radiation. The improved treatment schemes seem in most cases to work well and to solve the problem. If necessary, for certain radio-resistant tumors the normal treatment might also be supplemented by other methods. [References: 35]

The cells were irradiated with either intermediate linear energy transfer (LET approximately 55 keV/microns) He ions or with 60Co photons and showed cell type-specific variations in their survival curves. The induction of dsb, per DNA unit, increased linearly with dose for both radiation qualities, and there were no cell type-dependent differences. However, the dsb induction frequency increased for all three cell lines with an RBE of 1.31 +/- 0.08 (SD) after He ion irradiation. All three cell lines showed biphasic dsb rejoining patterns with cell type-specific differences. The differences between the cell lines were somewhat smaller after irradiation with He ions, although the patterns were very similar to those seen after photon irradiation. The shoulders in the survival curves disappeared after He ion irradiations, however the cells retained the capacity to rejoin dsb. After 8-h rejoining the increase of LET to intermediate values did not give a higher fraction of residual dsb	
1293	A semiempirical method for the description of off-center ratios at depth from linear accelerators	Algorithms, Empirical Research, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Quality Control, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Reproducibility of Results, Scattering,Radiation	A semiempirical method for the description of the off-center ratios (OCR) at depth from linear accelerators is presented, which is based on a method originally developed for cobalt-60 (60)Co units. The OCR profile is obtained as the sum of 2 components: the first describes an OCR similar to that from a (60)Co unit, which approximates that resulting from the modification of the original x-ray intensity distribution by the flattening filter; the second takes into account the variable effect of the flattening filter on dose profile for different depths and field sizes, by considering the existence of a block and employing the negative field concept. The above method is formulated in a mathematical expression, where the parameters involved are obtained by fitting to the measured OCRs. Using this method, OCRs for various depths and field sizes, from a Philips SL-20 for the 6 MV x-ray beam and a Siemens Primus 23, for both the 6-MV and 23-MV x-ray beams, were reproduced with good accuracy. Furthermore, OCRs for other fields and depths that were not included in the fitting procedure were calculated using linear interpolation to estimate the values of the parameters. The results indicate that this method can be used to calculate OCR profiles for a wide range of depths and field sizes from a measured set of data and may be used for monitor unit calculations for off-axis points using a standard geometry. It may also be useful as a quality control tool to verify the accuracy of lacking profiles calculated by a treatment planning system

The simplicity of the cyclotron control system is discussed. The physical characteristics of the neutron beam are described. The central axis percent depth dose curve is equivalent to that of a 4 MV x-ray beam. The depth of maximum dose occurs at approximately 9 mm depth and the surface dose is between 40% and 45%. The multirod collimator allows for the production of irregularly shaped fields of size up to 26.5 x 30 cm, without excessive exposure to operating personnel

The calculation represents a single-fraction ion exposure (roughly corresponding to a 2 Gy fraction of megavolt X rays) and exploits concepts used in clinical radiotherapy, such as entrance, or 'skin' ion dose. The depth distribution of cells surviving their irradiation by a beam of 385 MeV amu(-1) carbon ions is calculated over the range of the stopping ions, as a sequence of track-segments, in the continuous slowing-down approximation. An interpretation of the 'clinical relative biological effectiveness' concept is suggested

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed gate pulse controller that starts and stops irradiation at a chosen phase of the respiratory cycle by controlling a linear accelerator was used in six patients with lung cancer. A laser displacement sensor was used for the detection of respiratory motion. Three patients underwent radiation therapy during the cycles between 50% expiration and 50% inspiration (step 1), and three patients underwent radiation therapy during the cycles between 70% expiration and 30% inspiration (step 2). RESULTS: The system functioned well; irradiation was verified with portal verification radiography in all six patients. The range of the tumor position during synchronized irradiation was detectable with fast portal localization radiography. The treatment times for steps 1 and 2 were 1.38-1.71 and 2.03-2.18 times longer, respectively, than those for conventional irradiation. CONCLUSION: Synchronized irradiation with the authors' system allowed convenient and reliable reduction of the target volume. Further study is needed to standardize the system for clinical use

Method. The technique was elaborated by O. Betti in the early 80. He used several coronal arcs to irradiate the center of the target with X rays circular minibeams. Their diameter (6 to 20 mm) is chosen according to the size of the nidus. The patient is seated in a specially built armchair. His head is immobilized with the Talairach frame afixed in the calvarium by 4 special screws: they allow to remove the frame after stereotactic angiography and/or CTscan and to replace it to perform the stereotactic irradiation. The frame and the head rotate around an horizontal axis passing by the linac isocenter ie the center of the target volume. The combination of both movements: rotation of the Linac and rotation of the stereotactic frame covers a spherical sector representing the surface of portals of entry of the minibeams. The frame can slide on a plate allowing access to the entire brain. Results.The special seat and the frame are movable on curved rails allowing to avoid or reduce irradiation of the body of the patient. CONCLUSION: We have been using this system of irradiation in the seated position since 1986 to treat more than 900 patients

This retrospective study compares the results of treatment using hemibody irradiation (HBI) at the Royal Marsden Hospital (27 cases) with isotope therapy using the bone-seeking isotope strontium-89 (89Sr) at Southampton General Hospital (51 cases). Prior to analysis patients were matched for potential prognostic factors (performance status, bone scan extent of disease, age, histology and duration of hormone response) to minimize the effect of treatment selection bias. Pain control assessed at 3 months was similar for HBI and matched 89Sr cases, with 63% and 52% respectively showing some benefit. Median survival was similar for these groups at 20 and 21 weeks respectively. The unmatched 89Sr group, which had more favourable prognostic factors, had a better outcome with 96% showing improvement in pain and with a median survival of 59 weeks. Subsequent univariate analysis demonstrated that performance status and extent of disease on bone scan were of overriding importance in determining outcome. Transfusion requirements were higher for the HBI group than for the matched 89Sr group (50% and 25% respectively) but other bone marrow toxicity was similar. Despite routine anti-emetic therapy 37% of patients treated with HBI had some nausea or vomiting. Although expensive, 89Sr appears as effective a treatment option as HBI. Response is most likely with either approach when patients have a good performance status and a limited extent of disease. [References: 32]

We measured chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes before, during, and after radiotherapy, using the techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chemically induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC). Twenty-two lung cancer patients treated at HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) entered the study and signed an informed consent. Frequencies of lymphocytes with chromosomal aberrations at the end of carbon-ion therapy varied among the patients. This frequency was significantly correlated to the radiation field size and weakly correlated to the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes during the treatment. As a result, we have found that chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients treated for lung cancer by carbon-ions were dependent on target volume, possibly reflecting the increased involvement of lymph nodes in the target field	
2824	The eighteenth Douglas Lea lecture. 40 years of radiobiology: its impact on radiotherapy	Animals, Cell Division, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Hodgkin Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Methods, Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oxygen, Radiation, Radiobiology, Radiobiology/td [Trends], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/td [Trends]	The contributions of radiobiology to radiotherapy in the past 40 years are reviewed, taking the work of Gray and Read on bean roots with high LET radiation as the starting point. The main impact has been strategic and didactic because methods of measuring parameters in patients so as to affect individual treatments have not yet been developed. Many patients are now being treated with radiotherapy who would have been considered unsuitable 40 years ago and the radiobiological reasons for these changes are discussed. Improvements that have occurred in radiotherapy are reviewed and some projections about future potential improvements are made

The local control rate, cause-specific and overall survival rates of 146 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC were 82.0%, 59.0% and 59.0%, respectively. Radiation pneumonia was not serious and infrequent (2.1%). In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate of 50 patients was 100% without radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 74.0% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beams, excellent local control as in stage I NSCLC has been demonstrated, providing hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer

We examined the potential of computed radiography with a storage phosphor system (FCR-901/Siemens Digiscan) to overcome these drawbacks. Port films of various treatment sites were obtained for both, conventional films and digital storage phosphor screens with a DuPont cassette and steel intensifier screens under identical exposure settings. We examined port films from a linear accelerator and from a 60Co source. We found a superior contrast in the digital images and an almost total elimination of exposure errors. The differences between digital and conventional images, however, were less pronounced with films from the 60Co source. Unsharp mask filtering (medium kernel size, moderate enhancement) further improved image quality. Several sources of artefacts in the digital images could be described	
692	Modelling the expected increase in demand for particle radiotherapy: implications for the UK	Carbon, Great Britain, Humans, Ions, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators/sd [Supply & Distribution], Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization], Research, Time	The present rapid worldwide expansion of particle radiotherapy services will inevitably have an impact on clinical practice within the UK. The most recent results of developmental trials using protons and carbon ions are impressive, with high cure rates and little or no functional normal tissue changes and a very low level of serious treatment-related morbidity. The potential numbers of patients that will demand or are referred for treatment abroad are estimated, assuming different rates of change and treatment capacities with time. Even if the maximum demand were to be under 10% of all patients presently treated by radiotherapy, significant numbers (amounting to several thousand patients per year) may be advised to seek treatment abroad between 5 and 10 years from now. The gap between overall demand and the estimated numbers could be partly, although substantially, filled by the establishment of a single large UK facility. Should demand increase beyond the estimated level, for example due to improved screening of cancer, then a network of UK particle radiotherapy centres will be required

941	A small-body portable graphite calorimeter for dosimetry in low-energy clinical proton beams	Calibration, Calorimetry/is [Instrumentation], Calorimetry/mt [Methods], Graphite/tu [Therapeutic Use], Heat, Humans, Ions, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Time, Uncertainty, Water	Calorimetry has been recommended and performed in proton beams for some time, but never has graphite calorimetry been used as a reference dosimeter in clinical proton beams. Furthermore, only a few calorimetry measurements have been reported in ocular proton beams. In this paper we describe the construction and performance of a small-body portable graphite calorimeter for clinical low-energy proton beams. Perturbation correction factors for the gap effect, volume averaging effect, heat transfer phenomena and impurity effect are calculated and applied in a comparison with ionization chamber dosimetry following IAEA TRS-398. The ratio of absorbed dose to water obtained from the calorimeter measurements and from the ionization measurements varied between 0.983 and 1.019, depending on the beam type and the ionization chamber calibration modality. Standard uncertainties on these values varied between 1.9% and 2.5% including a substantial contribution from the kQ values in IAEA TRS-398. The (Wair/e)p values inferred from these measurements varied between 33.6 J C(-1) and 34.9 J C(-1) with similar standard uncertainties. A number of improvements for the small-body portable graphite calorimeter and the experimental set-up are suggested for potential reduction of the uncertainties

Exponentially growing cultures of early passaged fibroblasts were grown as monolayers on thin mylar sheets and were irradiated with accelerated protons, deuterons or helium-3 ions. The mutation rates were compared with those generated by 137Cs gamma-rays. LET values for charged particles accelerated at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, using the track segment mode, ranged from 10 to 150 keV/micron. After irradiation, cells were trypsinized, subcultured and assayed for both cytotoxicity and 6-thioguanine resistance. For gamma-rays, and for the charged particles of lower LET, the dose-response curves for cell survival were characterized by a marked initial shoulder, but approximated to an exponential function of dose for higher LETs. Mutation frequencies, likewise, showed a direct correlation to LET over the dose range examined. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for mutagenesis, based on the initial slopes of the dose-response curves, ranged from 1.30 for 10 keV/micron protons to 9.40 for 150 keV/micron helium-3 ions. Results of the present studies indicate that high-LET radiations, apart from being efficient inducers of cell lethality, are even more efficient in mutation induction as compared to low-LET ionizing radiation. These data are consistent with results previously obtained with both rodent and human fibroblast cell lines

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia	
4135	Surface dose for megavoltage photon beams outside the treatment field	Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Gamma Rays, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radioisotope Teletherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Skin	Measurements made on photon beams from four different radiotherapy machines have demonstrated that skin dose several centimeters outside the boundary of a treatment field may be as much as 20% of the central axis maximum dose. This surface dose has been measured for an AECL Theratron 80, Siemens Mevatron VI, Varian Clinac 20, and CGR Sagittaire for distances up to 12 cm outside the field boundary and for depths up to the depth of maximum central axis dose. This dose has also been measured as a function of field size and of source-to-skin distance. For the lower energy photon beams, this radiation is significantly attenuated in the first 2-3 mm of tissue, while for higher energy beams, a buildup phenomenon with a dmax of 2-3 mm is observed. The magnitude of this radiation is approximately linearly dependent upon field dimension for all energies

Computer-simulated tracks of energy deposition events from protons and their secondary electrons were superimposed on a higher-order DNA target model describing the spatial coordinates of the whole genome inside a human cell. Induction of DNA double-strand breaks was simulated for proton irradiation with LET values between 1.6 and 70 keV/microm and various reference radiation qualities. The yield of DSBs after proton irradiation was found to rise continuously with increasing LET up to about 20 DSBs per Gbp and Gy, corresponding to an RBE up to 2.2. About half of this increase resulted from a higher yield of DSB clusters associated with small fragments below 10 kbp. Exclusion of experimentally unresolved multiple DSBs reduced the maximum DSB yield by 30% and shifted it to an LET of about 40 keV/microm. Simulated fragment size distributions deviated significantly from random breakage distributions over the whole size range after irradiation with protons with an LET above 10 keV/microm. Determination of DSB yields using equations derived for random breakage resulted in an underestimation by up to 20%. The inclusion of background fragments had only a minor influence on the distribution of the DNA fragments induced by radiation. Despite limited numerical agreement, the simulations reproduced the trends in proton-induced DNA DSBs and fragment induction found in recent experiments. Copyright 2003 by Radiation Research Society

PATIENTS: and method. From January 1984 to December 1998, 705 patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, radiophysicians and radiotherapists. Age of revelation of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations ranged between birth to 73 years (mean 27, median 25). Age at time of radiosurgery ranged between 7 and 75 years (mean 33, median 31). There were 410 males for 295 females (sex- ratio 1.4). Symptoms of revelation were hemorrhage for 59%, seizures for 23%, headaches for 14% and progressive deficits for 4%. Discovery of cerebral arteriovenous malformation was fortuitous in 4% of cases. Repartition following Spetzler's grading was 12% in grade I, 36% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 12% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. Maximal size ranged between 4 and 60 mm (mean 23, median 20). Volume ranged between 0.2 and 24.3 cc (mean 3.8, median 2.8). Majority of cerebral arteriovenous malformations were large size (42% with size higher than 25 mm) and large volume (54% higher than 10 cc. 54% of patients had treatment prior radiosurgery: 38% had embolization, 10% were operated, 4% were treated by radiosurgery (reirradiation) and 3% were operated and embolized. RESULTS: Overall complete obliteration rate was 55%. The obliteration rate was correlated with size (77% for cAVMs lower than 15 mm, 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations between 15 and 25 mm, and 44% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 25 mm), with volume (94% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations lower than 1 cc, 64% between 1 and 4 cc, 48% between 4 and 10 cc, and 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 10 cc), dose at reference isodose, minimal dose, morphological parameters (presence of dural components, arteriolovenous fistula, plexiform angioarchitecture, arterial steal, arterial recruitment, deep exclusive drainage, venous plicature, venous confluence, venous ectasia, venous reflux), sectional topography and good recovery of the target. Embolization was a confusion factor not associated with obliteration rate. After multivariate analysis, only Dmin and complete coverage of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations were correlated with obliteration rate. Delay of obliteration was significantly correlated after multivariate analysis with Dmin, complete coverage, arteriolovenulary angioarchitecture (positive correlation) and venous ectasia (negative correlation). CONCLUSION: Overall complete obliteration rate is unreliable data to assess efficacy of radiosurgical method in the tretment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The obliteration rate must be interpretated after stratification on several morphological and dosimetric parameters

Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been recognized as a clinicopathologic entity distinct from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapy, and prognosis of ESCC. METHODS: The medical records, from Jan. 1985 to Dec. 2005, of 53 patients with pathologically proved ESCC were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 39 were men and 14 were women, with the median age of 53 years (range, 27-76 years). Of the 53 cases of ESCC, 33 (62.3%) were detected in the esophagus, 5 in the cervix, 4 in the larynx, 3 in the pharynx, 2 in the upper sinus, 2 in the rectum and sublingual gland, 1 in the thyroid gland, 1 in the pleura, and 1 in the liver. Forty patients (75.5%) had limited disease (LD) and 13 (24.5%) had extensive disease (ED). Patients with ED mostly received platinum-based chemotherapy, for which the response rate was 69.2%. Patients with LD were treated with a variety of therapeutic modalities: 7 were treated with surgery plus radiochemotherapy, 3 with surgery plus radiotherapy, 18 with surgery plus chemotherapy, 6 with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, 4 with radiotherapy alone, and 2 with chemotherapy alone. The median survival time (MST) was 20 months for all patients, and the 1-and 3-year survival rates were 41.3% and 31.4%. MST for patients with ED and LD were 15 months and 26 months, respectively, and 1-and 3-year survival rates were 51.1% vs. 14.4%, and 42.5% vs. 0% (P=0.017 ). CONCLUSIONS: ESCC is identified in various sites, with the most common primary site being the esophagus. Multimodality therapy has become increasingly used for the majority of patients with LD-ESCC. Combination chemotherapy has been a major treatment for patients with ED-ESCC. Generally, the prognosis of LD-ESCC is significantly superior to ED-ESCC	
2593	Radiosurgery using a 4MV linear accelerator. Technique and radiobiologic implications	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Child, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation Dosage, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time	In the authors' technique, the stereotactically localized target is fixed to the isocenter of a 4 MV linear accelerator. The irradiation is carried out along 9-17 non-coplanar arcs distributed on a 160 degrees cylindrical sector. High doses (10-50 Gy) are delivered in one or two sessions. From 1982, 65 patients have been treated (shortest follow-up 6 months). The dose was chosen according to the pathology and to the volume of the lesion. Good clinical results have been obtained in low-grade gliomas, acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and other selected types of intracranial lesions. Therapeutic effects in terms of clinical condition and size of the lesions have been plotted in relation to time elapsed and dose employed	
2592	External stereotactic irradiation by linear accelerator	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Head, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Skull, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	Stereotactic radiotherapy has two advantages: (a) the possibility of giving high radiation doses to small but spatially well-defined target volumes and (b) the presence of a stepped dose gradient between the target volume and the surrounding healthy tissues. To utilize these advantages, the authors built a new stereotactic head frame by which the intracranial target is fixed to the rotational isocenter of a 4-MV linear accelerator. The collimator openings are selected according to the volume and the three-dimensional configuration of the target, and the radiation dose is based on the radiosensitivity of the lesion. After the patient is fixed to the frame, the radiation source and the patient are rotated so that the target is irradiated through infinite portals distributed over the convexity of the skull. It is thereby possible to obtain very high radiation doses centered into the target with a stepped dose gradient. The preliminary radiodosimetric tests and the operative technique are described. The advantages of this technique compared to interstitial radiotherapy and Leksell's radiosurgery are emphasized. This noninvasive procedure has been used to treat a series of intracranial tumors	
2115	[Usefulness of visualized highly sensitive new chemical dosimeter: application to blood irradiation]. [Japanese]	Absorption, Blood Transfusion, Blood/re [Radiation Effects], Gamma Rays, Graft vs Host Disease/pc [Prevention & Control], Humans, Protons, Radiometry, Sensitivity and Specificity, Universities	In the prophylaxis of post-transfusion GVHD, it is recommended to irradiate blood components with an absorbed dose ranging from 15 Gy to 50 Gy. We applied a new chemical dosimeter to measure absorbed dose for blood irradiation. This system is composed of diphenyliodoniumchloride (DICI) as an oxidizer and crystal violet lactone as a pH indicator. Protons are released from DICI after irradiation. The maximum absorption wavelength of this indicator is 610 nm, and absorbance is linearly related with a given dose from 1 to 50 Gy. Coloration is stable for at least 2 weeks when stored in the dark at 4 degrees C. This system may be used as a chemical dosimeter for blood irradiation

4380	The PIOTRON: initial performance, preparation and experience with pion therapy	Beryllium, Elementary Particles, Humans, Immobilization, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Skin, Water	The PIOTRON is a large solid angle superconducting channel built for the use of negative pi-mesons in radiotherapy. The pions are produced by protons of 590 MeV striking a target of molybdenum or beryllium. The pions are divided into 60 channels and deflected twice to enter the treatment volume radially. The momentum and the momentum band for all 60 channels can be chosen and the beam spot of Bragg peak pions at the isocenter of the applicator is a few centimeters in each direction. Dynamic scanning can thus achieve 3-dimensionally shaped treatment volumes. Two different methods are available: the ring scan, using changes of pion range; and the spot scan, involving translation of the patient through the fixed beam spot. Dose distributions of individual and multiple beams were plotted in a cylindrical water phantom. Radiobiological experiments with mammalian cells in gel and with mouse feet were performed. A special beam geometry using a sector of 15 beams was selected for the first treatments of patients with metastatic skin nodules. Six patients were treated. Acute skin reactions were scored and compared with those from orthovoltage therapy with comparable beam geometry. The RBE for 10 fractions is between 1.4 and 1.5. The next step involved treatment of patients inside water-bolus rings in preparation for dynamic therapy. Patients were then treated with the spot scan dynamic mode in the water bolus. The initial responses and reactions are favorable and confirm the feasibility and accuracy of dynamic pion therapy	
4164	Stereotactic percutaneous single dose irradiation of brain metastases with a linear accelerator	Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Female, Hospitalization, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques, Time	The effectivity of stereotactic percutaneous single dose irradiations in the treatment of solitary brain metastases has been assessed in a series of 12 consecutive patients. Only radioresistant deeply localized metastases have been treated. Photon-irradiation was carried out with the convergent beam technique using stereotactic localization methods, in a linear accelerator facility. In 11 of the 12 patients no side effects occurred. The first 7 patients, who could be observed 3 months or longer, have been studied in detail. In each of these cases single dose irradiation with 20-30 Gy yielded arrest of tumor growth. In one case a marked decrease in contrast enhancement and in four cases shrinkage of the metastasis as well as a marked decrease of the edema occurred. In every patient a marked, sometimes dramatic improvement of the clinical condition was achieved, beginning a few days after irradiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a valuable tool in the treatment of inoperable, radioresistant brain metastases, the major advantage being high efficacy and smoothness of the procedure, as well as extremely short hospitalization times (2-3 days)	
1058	Delivery time comparison for intensity-modulated radiation therapy with/without flattening filter: a planning study	Algorithms, Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Head, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiobiology, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sensitivity and Specificity, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, X-Rays	The treatment delivery time of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a multileaf collimator (MLC) is generally longer than that of conventional radiotherapy. In theory, removing the flattening filter from the treatment head may reduce the beam-on time by enhancing the output dose rate, and then reduce the treatment delivery time. And in practice, there is a possibility of delivering the required fluence distribution by modulating the unflattened non-uniform fluence distribution. However, the reduction of beam-on time may be discounted by the increase of leaf-travel time and (or) verification-and-recording (V&R) time. Here we investigate the overall effect of flattening filter on the treatment delivery time of IMRT with MLCs implemented in the step and shoot method, as well as with compensators on six hybrid machines. We compared the treatment delivery time with/without flattening filter for ten nasopharynx cases and ten prostate cases by observing the variations of the ratio of the beam-on time, segment number, leaf-travel time and the treatment delivery time with dose rate, leaf speed and V&R time. The results show that, without the flattening filter, the beam-on time reduces for both static MLC and compensator-based techniques: the number of segments and the leaf-travel time increase slightly for the static MLC technique; the relative IMRT treatment delivery time decreases more with lower dose rate, higher leaf speed and shorter V&R overhead time. The absolute treatment delivery time reduction depends on the fraction dose. It is not clinically significant at a fraction dose of 2 Gy for the technique of removing the flattening filter, but becomes significant when the fraction dose is as high as that for radiosurgery	
3796	A measurement of w for 150 MeV protons in nitrogen and argon	Argon, Computers, Humans, Nitrogen, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	Ionisation chamber dosimetry for proton radiation therapy requires accurate measurements of w, the average energy necessary to produce an ion pair for protons in the therapeutic energy range of 30-240 MeV. In this investigation, such measurements were made at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory for 150 MeV protons in nitrogen and argon with an accuracy of 2%. Ionisation and energy loss were measured simultaneously in a gas cell 1 m in length. A parallel plate ionisation chamber situated inside the gas cell was used to measure ionisation, and the energy loss was determined from time-of-flight and range measurements. The data indicate that w is 26.5 +/- 0.6 eV/(ion pair) for argon and 36.3 +/- 0.8 eV/(ion pair) for nitrogen. These results are consistent with measurements at lower energies	
369	Effectiveness of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of skull-base chordomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Child, Child,Preschool, Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm,Residual, Probability, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Skull Base Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival Analysis, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of carbon ion radiotherapy in chordomas of the skull base. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability	
2972	Radiation maculopathy after proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Color, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Photography, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Research, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Retinal Vessels/re [Radiation Effects], Vision, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: Radiation maculopathy is a microangiopathy of the retina, which is often observed after irradiation of the eye. To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes	
2193	Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with linear accelerator for uveal melanoma--preliminary Vienna results	Austria, Ciliary Body, Dose Fractionation, Eye, Fixation,Ocular, Follow-Up Studies, France, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Melanoma, Melanoma/pp [Physiopathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Safety, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Video Recording	PURPOSE: To study local tumor control and radiogenic side-effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and February 1998, 21 patients suffering from uveal melanomas have been treated with stereotactic 6 MeV LINAC (Saturne 43, General Electric, France) in conjunction with a stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB, Germany). Immobilization of the eye was ensured with an optical fixation system which was proven reliable. During radiotherapy, movements of the irradiated eye were controlled on a monitor and documented by video recording. All patients co-operated very well with the optical fixation system. In 1164 measurements, the median value of horizontal deviation of the diseased eye during treatment was 0.3 mm (range: 0 to 1.3 mm). Median vertical deviation was 0.2 mm (range: 0 to 1.2 mm). For all patients, mean tumor prominence before treatment was 6.0 +/- 2.2 mm. In 20 patients, the total dose of 70 Gy (at 80%) was delivered in 5 fractions within 10 days. In one patient with a ciliary body tumor, the total dose of 70 Gy was divided into 7 fractions for better sparing of the anterior eye segment. RESULTS: After a follow-up of at least 6 months, local tumor control was seen in all eyes. Mean tumor thickness reduction after 3, 6 and 9 months was 7%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Up to now, only mild subacute side-effects located in the anterior eye segment have been noticed. CONCLUSION: Optical fixation of the eye allows high precision stereotactic radiotherapy with small safety margins. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and 70 Gy total dose delivered in 5 fractions seems to be appropriate for local tumor control in uveal melanoma. Further long-term studies with extended number of patients will be necessary to conclude on the use of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma

Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University, for a ten-year period from 1976-1986. The overall incidence was 1.3% of all gynecologic malignancies. Twenty-four patients (83%) had squamous cell carcinoma and five (17%) had adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly located in the upper anterior and lateral vaginal vaults, whereas adenocarcinoma was found more often in the lower anterior and lateral vaginal vaults. The majority of the patients (96%) were managed by a combination of whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients had a recurrence in the vagina only, indicating the need for better local control. The overall survival rate was 48%. Patients with previous hysterectomy were more likely to develop serious treatment-related complications	
3894	A proton nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) study of human plasma prealbumin, including the development and application to spectral assignment of a combined ring current shift and NOE prediction program	Chemistry, Great Britain, Histidine, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Models,Molecular, Prealbumin, Protein Conformation, Protons, Research, Temperature	Human prealbumin, a homotetrameric protein with an Mr of approximately 55,000 has been characterised by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The pH dependences of the chemical shifts of the 4 histidine residues/subunit are unremarkable; variable temperature studies show that the protein tertiary and quaternary structure is stable to at least 80 degrees C. Assignment of a number of residues was aided by the development of a computer program, PARSNIP (Programme to Analyse Ring current Shifts and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) In Proteins), which employs high resolution x-ray crystal structure atomic co-ordinates (Blake, C.F., and Oatley, S.J. (1977) Nature 268, 115-120, in the case of prealbumin) and several different predictive formalisms to calculate structure-dependent ring current-induced shifts of aromatic and methyl group protons. The program combines these with distance measurements to give plots of expected NOE difference profiles resulting from irradiation at a discrete frequency. The routine should prove applicable to many proteins whose structures have been determined but which are too large for the application of sequential residue assignment techniques. Three well resolved high field shifted methyl groups resonating at 0.18, 0.28, and 0.34 ppm are assigned to Ala-120, Leu-111, and Val-122, respectively. NOEs between these signals and the aromatics, interaromatic effects, and effects involving some of the considerable number of downfield shifted alpha-protons, have been used to identify substituents on several other residues

995	A shielding design for an accelerator-based neutron source for boron neutron capture therapy	Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/is [Instrumentation], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Equipment Design, Facility Design and Construction, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Heat, Humans, Ohio, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Radiation, Radiation Protection/is [Instrumentation], Research	Research in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) at The Ohio State University Nuclear Engineering Department has been primarily focused on delivering a high quality neutron field for use in BNCT using an accelerator-based neutron source (ABNS). An ABNS for BNCT is composed of a proton accelerator, a high-energy beam transport system, a (7)Li target, a target heat removal system (HRS), a moderator assembly, and a treatment room. The intent of this paper is to demonstrate the advantages of a shielded moderator assembly design, in terms of material requirements necessary to adequately protect radiation personnel located outside a treatment room for BNCT, over an unshielded moderator assembly design	
4593	Microdosimetric evaluation of the 400 MeV/nucleon carbon beam at HIMAC	Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Helium, Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiobiology, Radiometry/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities	Microdosimetric single event spectra were determined as a function of depth in an acrylic phantom for the carbon beam at HIMAC using a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) coupled to a scintillation counter system. The fragments produced by the carbon beam were identified by the deltaE-time of flight distribution obtained from two scintillation counters which were positioned at the up- and down-stream of the TEPC. Lineal energy distribution for the carbon beam and its five fragments, namely, proton, helium, lithium, beryllium, and boron ions, were measured in the lineal-energy range of 5-1000 keV/microm at five phantom depths between 0 and 230 mm. The dose distribution for the carbon beam and its fragments were obtained separately. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the carbon beam in the phantom was calculated using a response function. The maximum RBE for the carbon beam was found to be about 5 near the Bragg peak. It was observed to rapidly decrease for Bragg peaks occurring at deeper positions in the phantom. The dose from the beam fragments accounted for about 30% to the total dose, however, its contribution to the RBE was less than 17%	
4188	Neutron therapy--the historical background	Cyclotrons/hi [History], Energy Transfer, History,20th Century, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Neutrons/hi [History], Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Oxygen, Physics, Radiation, Radiobiology, Sweden, Time, Universities, X-Rays	Neutron therapy was first introduced by Stone et al. in 1938, i.e. more than 10 years earlier than electron beam therapy and only 6 years after the discovery of neutrons. In spite of the impressive accomplishment in generating an adequate therapy beam, time was also found for careful radiobiological studies of neutron beams. However, it was not considered that for a certain early reaction the late effects were much greater with neutrons than with x-rays. The severe late sequelae in proportion to the few good results motivated the closure of this therapy. Neutron therapy was again introduced in Hammersmith hospital at the end of the 1960's. The major reason seems to have been to overcome the oxygen effect. Encouraging results were reported. It was argued that the very favourable statistics on local tumour control were obtained at the expense of more frequent and more severe complications. A clinical trial in Edinburgh seemed to indicate this, but it was not proved in the end as the two trials differed regarding fractionation. Today about 16,000 patients have been treated with neutrons. The neutron beams now used differ significantly, both regarding dose distributions and microdosimetrical properties, from those utilized earlier. The advantage of neutrons is still, however, controversial. There are indications that neutron treatment may be favourable for some tumours. A careful cost-benefit study ought to be performed before the creation of a neutron therapy centre in Sweden as the group of patients suitable for neutrons is limited, and there may be new possibilities for improvement of photon and electron treatment with much smaller resources	
2375	The 8 MeV linear accelerator at the MRC Cyclotron Unit, Hammersmith Hospital, London	Animals, Electrons, History,20th Century, Humans, London, Neoplasms/hi [History], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators/hi [History], Radiobiology/hi [History], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/hi [History], Research, Time	This machine was the first linear accelerator designed for medical use and the first to be installed in a hospital. The first patient was treated in 1953 and the last in 1969. During this period the machine was used for research during the evenings and latterly it was available for research all day long. It was switched off for the last time in February 1984. In addition to the X-ray beam, electrons were used for treatment and for research, where the high dose rate and large field size were particularly useful. An account is given of some of the highlights of the clinical and research programmes	
3221	The utility of the Philips SRI-100 Real Time Portal Imaging Device in a case of postoperative irradiation for prevention of heterotopic bone formation following total hip replacement	Adult, Australia, Hip Joint, Hip Joint/re [Radiation Effects], Hip Prosthesis/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Male, Ossification,Heterotopic/et [Etiology], Ossification,Heterotopic/pc [Prevention & Control], Pain, Particle Accelerators, Quality Control, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Risk, Time	The new Radiation Oncology Department at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne, Australia commenced operation in June 1992. As part of quality control the Philips SL-15 linear accelerator was fitted with the Philips SRI-100 Real Time Portal Imaging Device (RTPID), the first such apparatus in Australia. One of its major advantages over older systems is its ability to provide a permanent hard copy of the image of the field treated. The computer image can be immediately manipulated and enhanced on the screen (with respect to such qualities as brightness and contrast) prior to the printing of the hard copy. This is a significant improvement over the more cumbersome older port films that required developing time, without any pre-assessment of the image quality. The utility of the Philips SRI-100 RTPID is demonstrated in the case of a patient irradiated soon after total hip replacement, as prophylaxis against heterotopic bone formation (HBF). The rapidity and quality of image production is a major advantage in these patients where post-operative pain may result in positional change between film exposure and image production. Extremely accurate shielding block position is essential to shield the prosthesis (and allow bone ingrowth for fixation) whilst avoiding inadvertent shielding of the areas at risk for HBF. A review of the literature is provided

Alignment is achieved by acquiring images of the treatment room positioning laser cross-hairs superimposed on the radiosurgical circular field image. An alignment algorithm calculates the center of the radiosurgical field image as well as the intersection of the laser cross-hairs. This determines any alignment deviations and the information is then used to translate the radiosurgical collimator to its correct aligned position. Two detectors, each being sensitive to the lasers and ionizing radiation, were used to acquire the radiation/laser images. The first detector consists of a 0.3-mm-thick layer of photoconducting a-Se deposited on a 1.5-mm-thick copper plate and the second is film. The algorithm and detector system can detect deviations with a precision of approximately 0.04 mm. A device with gyroscopic degrees of freedom was built in order to firmly hold the detector at any orientation perpendicular to the radiosurgical beam axis. This device was used in conjunction with our alignment algorithm to quantify the isocentric sphere relative to the treatment room lasers over all gantry and couch angles used in dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery

Our initial experience was based on established studies showing the utility of protons for certain management problems, but since then we have engaged in a planned program to exploit the capabilities of proton radiation and expand its applications in accordance with progressively accumulating clinical data. Our cumulative experience has confirmed that protons are a superb tool for delivering conformal radiation treatments, enabling delivery of effective doses of radiation and sparing normal tissues from radiation exposure.

567	IMRT delivery to a moving target by dynamic MLC tracking: delivery for targets moving in two dimensions in the beam's eye view	Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Humans, Knowledge, Models,Statistical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Software, Time	A new modification of the dynamic multileaf collimator (dMLC) delivery technique for intensity-modulated therapy (IMRT) is outlined. This technique enables the tracking of a target moving through rigid-body translations in a 2D trajectory in the beam's eye view. The accuracy of the delivery versus that of deliveries with no tracking and of 1D tracking techniques is quantified with clinically derived intensity-modulated beams (IMBs). Leaf trajectories calculated in the target-reference frame were iteratively synchronized assuming regular target motion. This allowed the leaves defined in the lab-reference frame to simultaneously follow the target motion and to deliver the required IMB without violation of the leaf maximum-velocity constraint. The leaves are synchronized until the gradient of the leaf position at every instant is less than a calculated maximum. The delivered fluence in the target-reference frame was calculated with a simple primary-fluence model. The new 2D tracking technique was compared with the delivered fluence produced by no-tracking deliveries and by 1D tracking deliveries for 33 clinical IMBs. For the clinical IMBs normalized to a maximum fluence of 200 MUs, the rms difference between the desired and the delivered IMB was 15.6 +/- 3.3 MU for the case of a no-tracking delivery, 7.9 +/- 1.6 MU for the case where only the primary component of motion was corrected and 5.1 +/- 1.1 MU for the 2D tracking delivery. The residual error is due to interpolation and sampling effects. The 2D tracking delivery technique requires an increase in the delivery time evaluated as between 0 and 50% of the unsynchronized delivery time for each beam with a mean increase of 13% for the IMBs tested. The 2D tracking dMLC delivery technique allows an optimized IMB to be delivered to moving targets with increased accuracy and with acceptable increases in delivery time. When combined with real-time knowledge of the target motion at delivery time, this technique facilitates improved target conformality relative to no-tracking deliveries and allows PTV margin reduction

DESIGN: A retrospective, nonrandomized comparative study. METHODS: Charts of patients treated with 125I, 106Ru, and PBRT for choroidal melanoma between January 1988 and June 1996 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospitals were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Local control of choroidal melanomas after 125I, 106Ru, or PBRT. RESULTS: A total of 597 patients were identified (125I = 190, 106Ru = 140, PBRT = 267). Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did patients treated with either 125I (P = 0.0133; confidence interval [CI], 1.26-7.02; risk ratio, 2.97) or PBRT (P = 0.0097; CI, 1.30-6.66; risk ratio, 2.94). A stepwise Cox proportional hazard model found maximal basal diameter to be a significant covariate (P = 0.0033). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did those patients treated with either 125I or PBRT	
848	RBE and weighting of absorbed dose in ion-beam therapy	Animals, Brachytherapy, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time	Absorbed dose is the fundamental quantity used to quantify the exposure of any biological system to ionizing radiation. However, the relationship between dose and biological effect is not unique but varies with fractionation and time factor(s), radiation quality and irradiation conditions. In radiation therapy, weighting factors are used to correlate absorbed dose and clinical effects when altering irradiation conditions, or for combining or comparing different technical modalities. For some well established therapy modalities (e.g. fractionated photon beam therapy), a general agreement on weighting factors has been reached: it is based on the linear-quadratic model. For neutron, proton or ion therapy, the differences in radiation quality are currently accounted for using a diversity of methods (almost hospital specific). This paper reviews the current approaches used for evaluating or selecting the weighting factors and their application in clinical practice. The weighting factors take account of the RBE and other factors, such as fractionation when needed. Harmonization of these approaches will facilitate the exchange of information within the radiation oncology community and between centres using different technical modalities. In any case, when reporting the treatments, absorbed dose and irradiation conditions should always be specified in addition to the weighting factor and the weighted dose

Proton beam treatment of large numbers of uveal melanoma patients consistently achieves local control rates in excess of 95%, and eye retention rates of approximately 90%. Visual preservation is related to initial visual acuity, tumor size and location, and dose received by the macula, disc, and lens. The probability of distant metastasis is increased by larger tumor diameter, more anterior tumor location, and older patient age. Proton therapy is also effective treatment for patients with ocular angiomas, hemangiomas, metastatic tumors, and retinoblastomas, and may be beneficial for patients with exudative ("wet") age-related macular degeneration

Fragment distributions induced by low ion fuences were found to be much more shifted towards small fragment sizes than the distributions obtained after corresponding doses of X-rays. The average fragment length was found to be significantly smaller than the full plasmid length even for single ion traversals	
2258	Radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) of megavoltage X-ray and electron beams in radiotherapy	Cell Line, Cell Survival, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Colonic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Electrons, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Survival, X-Rays	Recent experiments indicate that significant differences exist in the microdosimetric properties (i.e., lineal energy distributions) of megavoltage X-ray and electron beams used in radiation therapy. In particular, dose averaged values of lineal energy for 18 MeV electrons are 10-30% lower than for 10 MeV bremsstrahlung X rays, which in turn are 30-60% lower than for 250 kVp X rays. Differences of this magnitude may manifest themselves in observable radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) differences between these radiations. Cell survival data have been obtained for line DLD-1 human tumor cells on all three of the above radiation sources. Results clearly demonstrate an RBE difference between orthovoltage and megavoltage radiation (P = 0.001). A small difference is also measured in RBE between megavoltage photons and megavoltage electrons, but the difference is not statistically significant (P = 0.25). All biological, dosimetric, and microdosimetric data were obtained under nearly identical geometric conditions. These data raise interesting questions vis a vis the applicability of microdosimetric theories in the interpretation of biological effects

[Russian]	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cavernous Sinus, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, USSR	The use of proton beam irradiation in neurosurgical clinical practice helps to find a solution to the problem of the treatment of inoperable malformations employing this method in some cases as an alternative to surgical intervention. Hypophyseal tumors, tumors of the cavernous sinus, arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area, and arteriovenous malformations are irradiated at the N. N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR, AMS using the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Methods of "piercing" irradiation and methods with the use of Bragg's peak are being developed. At present over 200 patients with hormonally active hypophyseal tumors, 30 patients with tumors of the cavernous sinus, 23 patients with deep seated arteriovenous malformations, and 10 patients with spontaneous arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area have been irradiated. This method seems to hold promise in neurosurgical practice. Extension of the range of clinical applications of proton beam therapy in neurosurgery requires the development of various techniques of irradiation, all possible approaches to various targets on the basis of contemporary methods of computerized diagnosis, topometry and irradiation design

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Circular fields, square fields, and 12 irregular fields for patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis were included in this study. All fields were shaped using the MLC and conventional blocks. A geometric criterion was defined as the amount of area discrepancy between the MLC and the prescription outline. The "least area discrepancy" (LAD) of the MLC conformation was searched by selecting the collimator angle, meanwhile keeping a preselected position along the width of the leaf into the prescribed field. Five LAD conventions were studied. These included the LAD-0, LAD-1/3, LAD-1/2, and LAD-2/3 that inserted the leaves at the 0, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of the leaf end into the prescription field, respectively. In addition, the LAD optimization was applied to the transecting (TRN) approach for leaf conformation that prescribed an equal area of overblocking and underblocking under each leaf. Film dosimetry was performed in a 20 cm polystyrene phantom at 10 cm depth 100 cm from source to axis distance (SAD) for both 6 and 18 MV photons with each of the above MLC conformations and conventional blocks. The field penumbra width, defined as the mean of the separation between the 20% and 80% isodose lines along the normal of the prescription field edge, was calculated using both the MLC and conventional block film dosimetry and compared. In a similar way, the d20 is defined as the mean separation between the 20% isodose line and the prescription field edge, and the d80 is defined as the mean separation between the 80% isodose line and the prescription field edge. RESULTS: The field penumbra width for all MLC conventions was approximately 2 mm larger than that of the conventional block. However, there was a larger variation of the separation distribution in the penumbra region of the irregular fields for the MLC, which had a standard deviation of 1 mm (a factor of 5 larger than the conventional block). The dosimetry for the circular fields showed that the LAD-TRN, LAD-1/2, and LAD-1/3 approximated the conventional blocking well in terms of d20 and d80; however, no single convention produced the best conformation for both measures. The dosimetric result of the patient treatment fields was similar for all sites. The LAD-1/3, LAD-1/2, and LAD-TRN strategies conformed to within 1 to 1.5 mm of the d80 of the conventional block for both 6 MV and 18 MV, respectively. The LAD-1/2 and LAD-TRN conformations were virtually identical, although it is proven analytically that the LAD-1/2 convention has the least overall area discrepancy of all conventions. CONCLUSIONS: The five MLC conformation conventions resulted in similar dosimetric penumbrae for all field shapes studied. The LAD-1/3, LAD-TRN, and LAD-1/2 produced the more favorable approximation to conventional block. The field penumbra width, although useful for evaluating irregular field shapes, could not describe the large local variations in the penumbra along the field edge for the MLC. These local variations could be of clinical concern when they appear near vital organs. However, the variation in a local region can potentially be reduced by minimizing the jaggedness of the leaf steps in that local region. The dosimetric results were useful as guidelines for the clinicians in the evaluation and adjustment of MLC leaf positions

Pre-treatment with a radioprotectant, adeturone (S-2-aminoethylisothiuronium adenosine-5'-triphosphate), allowed electrophoretic mobility to be maintained within normal limits, with more stable values in the case of alpha-irradiations. The experimental evidence is discussed in terms of the protectant's involvement in repair of radiation-induced conformational changes in surface membrane components

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of sequential CT images at every 0.2 s was reconstructed from continuous X-ray projection data accumulated by dynamic helical scanning. At the same time that CT data was acquired, the respiratory signal of the patient and the X-ray on/off signal on CT scanner were recorded. Each CT image was timed according to the phase of respiration waveform. Conversion of the CT number to the water equivalent path length (WEL) was performed with our treatment planning system that included a conversion table. As an illustration, the CT images of a patient with liver cancer at the right upper lobe were analyzed. The geometric size of the liver and WELs from body surface to isocenter were measured in each CT image. RESULTS: Variations of WEL from body surface to isocenter at the anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior direction were 6.2 mm and 18.9 mm, respectively. Liver size changed by 35.2 mm. However, these variations were shown to be considerably reduced by gated irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: A method using sequential CT images with respiration waveform was proposed. It appeared to be useful in evaluating the uncertainties of the range calculation associated with patient breathing
