The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

This institutional phase II study was designed to assess whether dose escalation to 90 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) with conformal protons and photons in accelerated fractionation would improve local tumor control and patient survival. METHODS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, Karnofsky Performance Scale score of greater than or equal to 70, residual tumor volume of less than 60 ml, and a supratentorial, unilateral tumor. Actuarial survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 34% and 18%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months, with four patients alive 22 to 60 months postdiagnosis. Analysis by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prognostic criteria or Medical Research Council indices showed a 5- to 11-month increase in median survival time over those of comparable conventionally treated patients. All patients developed new areas of gadolinium enhancement during the follow-up period. Histological examination of tissues obtained at biopsy, resection, or autopsy was conducted in 15 of 23 patients. Radiation necrosis only was demonstrated in seven patients, and their survival was significantly longer than that of patients with recurrent tumor (p = 0.01). Tumor regrowth occurred most commonly in areas that received doses of 60 to 70 CGE or less; recurrent tumor was found in only one case in the 90-CGE volume. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 90 CGE in accelerated fractionation prevented central recurrence in almost all cases. The median survival time was extended to 20 months, likely as a result of central control. Tumors will usually recur in areas immediately peripheral to this 90-CGE volume, but attempts to extend local control by enlarging the central volume are likely to be limited by difficulties with radiation necrosis

Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned

1	4684	Monte Carlo calculations for absolute dosimetry to determine machine outputs for proton therapy fields	Algorithms, Boston, Calibration, Head, Humans, Massachusetts, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Patients, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Reading, Research, Uncertainty	The prescribed dose in radiation therapy has to be converted into machine monitor units for patient treatment. This is done routinely for each spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) field either by calibration measurements, by using analytical algorithms or by relying on empirical data. At the Northeast Proton Therapy Center, a monitor unit corresponds to a fixed amount of charge collected in a segmented transmission ionization chamber inside the treatment head. The goal of this work was to use a detailed Monte Carlo model of the treatment head to calculate the dose delivered to the patient as a function of ionization chamber reading, i.e. to yield absolute dose in patients in terms of machine monitor units. The results show excellent agreement with measurements. For 50 SOBP fields considered in this study, the mean absolute difference between the experimental and the calculated value is 1.5%, where approximately 50% of the fields agree within 1%. This is within the uncertainties of the data. The Monte Carlo method has advantages over analytical algorithms because it takes into account scattered and secondary radiation, does not rely on empirical parameters, and provides a tool to study the influence of parts of the treatment head on the ionization chamber reading. Compared to experimental methods the Monte Carlo method has the advantage of being able to verify the dose in the patient geometry

With few exceptions, previous studies have combined results for clival and sacral chordomas, or for chordomas and other similar tumours such as chondrosarcoma, and thus it is difficult to be specific about effects of therapy. This study included histological review using immunohistochemistry to confirm diagnosis. Analysis of the survival data for our patients suggests that there are two subgroups with distinct survival patterns: one group with high mortality within the first 5 years, and a second group with an indolent disease process and near normal life expectancy. The age of the patients at presentation ranged from 7 to 78 years, with a mean of 44.3 years. Male: female distribution was 6:5. The commonest presentation was with cranial nerve palsy (94%) or with headache (60%). The most frequently involved cranial nerve was the VIth (60%), followed by the IXth and Xth (40% each). Comparing our results with those of 50 years ago, there was little improvement in the outlook for these patients, despite improvements in surgical approaches and the use of radiotherapy. The promising results in skull base tumours using proton therapy must be treated with caution until definite criteria for diagnosis and outcome have been established. There is a case for a multicentre prospective study of this disease

The commonest presentation was with cranial nerve palsy (94%) or with headache (60%). The most frequently involved cranial nerve was the VIth (60%), followed by the IXth and Xth (40% each). Comparing our results with those of 50 years ago, there was little improvement in the outlook for these patients, despite improvements in surgical approaches and the use of radiotherapy. The promising results in skull base tumours using proton therapy must be treated with caution until definite criteria for diagnosis and outcome have been established. There is a case for a multicentre prospective study of this disease

METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients with cervical carcinoma stages IIB-IVA who were treated with primary irradiation between the years 1985 and 1988 comprised the study group. The median survival of patients treated with 60cobalt units and linear accelerators was calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared using the log-rank test. Recurrence patterns were compared using chi-square analysis; p < .05 was considered significant for all tests. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five patients were treated with 60cobalt units (Group 1) and 53 patients were treated with a linear accelerator (Group 2). Group 1 and 2 were similar with regard to mean age and weight, stage distribution, and mean dose to point A. The rate of recurrence was comparable between Group 1 and 2 (65.6% vs. 64.2%) and no significant difference was found in overall survival between the groups (20 months vs. 21 months. p = 81). There was a trend toward increasing pelvic recurrence in Group 1 (50.8%) compared to Group 2 (35.8%, p = .08). CONCLUSIONS: 60Cobalt units and linear accelerators offer comparable rates of overall survival in patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells.

Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the "stable" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness

Stereotactic heavy-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery, using narrow beams of heavy ions (helium), demonstrates superior biological and physical characteristics in brain over X and gamma rays and protons, viz., improved dose distribution in the Bragg peak, sharp lateral and distal borders, and less multiple scattering and range straggling for the same residual range in CNS tissue. Examination of CNS tissue response and alteration of cerebral blood-flow dynamics related to heavy-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery is being undertaken using three-dimensional treatment planning and quantitative imaging utilizing cerebral angiography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cine-CT, xenon X-ray CT, and positron emission tomography (PET). Also under examination are the physical properties of narrow heavy-ion beams for improving methods of dose delivery and dose distribution and for establishing clinical RBE/LET and dose-response relationships for human CNS tissues. Based on the evaluation and treatment with stereotactically directed narrow beams of heavy ions of over 130 patients, with cerebral angiography and CT scanning, and with MRI and radioisotope scanning of selected patients, plus extensive clinical and neuroradiological follow-up, it appears that heavy-ion radiosurgery obliterates intracranial arteriovenous malformations or protects against rebleeding with reduced morbidity and mortality

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%).

A description of the facility and details of the accident are reported in Schauer et al., 1993a). In brief, during maintenance on the lower window pressure plate of a 3 MV potential drop accelerator, an operator placed his hands, head, and feet in the radiation beam. The filament voltage of the electron source was turned 'off', but the full accelerating potential was on the high voltage terminal. The operator's body, especially his extremities and head, were exposed to electron dark current. At approx. 3 months post-irradiation, the four digits of the victim's right hand and most of the four digits of his left hand were amputated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry was used to estimate the radiation dose to the victim's extremities. Extremity dose estimates ranged from 55.0 Gy (+/- 4.7 Gy) to 108 Gy (+/- 24.1 Gy)

A Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic system and a 6 MV linear accelerator have been modified for these treatments. By using multiple isocentric rotational fields, radiation doses from 1500 to 2500 cGy can be safely prescribed to the AVM in efforts to occlude the blood vessels without risking damage to nearby radiosensitive structures. Sixteen patients have been treated from February 1986 to July 1988 using the technique described

PBT has a half-century history, and more than 35,000 patients have been reported as having had treatments with proton beams worldwide. The historic change to this therapy occurred in the 1990s, when the Loma Linda University Medical Center began clinical activity as the first hospital in the world to utilize a medically dedicated proton therapy facility. Since then, similar hospital-based medically dedicated facilities have been constructed. Results from around the world have shown the therapeutic superiority of PBT over alternative treatment options for ocular melanoma, skull base sarcoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer. PBT is expected to achieve further advancement both clinically and technologically. [References: 15]

This is so as the smaller treatment volume has permitted a higher dose to the target (hence a high tumor control probability) and a lesser volume of non-target tissues being irradiated (consequently a reduced frequency and severity of treatment related morbidity). There are in place several important means for further improvements in dose distributions. These include: (a) 3D graphic reconstruction of the affected part with definition of the position of the tumor vis-a-vis the adjacent normal structures; (b) explicit inclusion in the treatment plan of the uncertainty band around each isodose contour; (c) on-line contrast enhanced visual monitoring of the target tissue during the individual treatment session; (d) gating of treatment so as to reduce the impact of patient motion on the needed treatment volume; (e) use of computer control systems to execute the treatment; and (f) use of treatment methods which achieve a reduced treatment volume. In an examination for sites for which treatment volumes might be decreased by a substantial factor we have compared treatment volumes for radical surgical and radiation therapy. Results are presented for carcinomas of the cervix (Stage IB), breast (Stage II), floor of mouth (Stage II). We describe a system developed here for on-line visual monitoring of the tissues covered by the treatment field. Brief descriptions are given of results of low LET charged particle radiation therapy and of intraoperative electron beam therapy. Also, the program developed here to use computer graphic techniques to display tumor and normal structures and isodose countours with uncertainty bands around each contour is mentioned

We have treated such patients with stereotactic Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy and report the follow-up of 74 of the first 75, 2 to 16 years after treatment. Proton-beam therapy is intended to induce subendothelial deposition of collagen and hyaline substance, which narrows the lumens of small vessels and thickens the walls of the malformation during the first 12 to 24 months after the procedure. Two deaths from hemorrhage occurred in the first 12 months after treatment, but no lethal or disabling hemorrhages occurred after this interval.

Brain tumors of this type were not induced by protons of other energies (32-2,300 MeV). Induction of HGA has been identified in human patients who have had radiation therapy to the head. We believe that the induction of HGA in the monkey is a consequence of dose distribution, not some unique "toxic" property of protons. Comparison of the human experience with the monkey data indicates the RBE for induction of brain tumors to be about one. It is unlikely that protons cause an unusual change in oncogenic expression, as compared to conventional electromagnetic radiation

A progressive reduction in glandular volume (of low, medium, and high grade) was observed in 48/50 patients respectively within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and 6-9 months after treatment. After 9 months only lesser modifications were observed. A statistically significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between volume decrease percentage and histologic grading of the tumor, but not with its stage. Within the groups of patients affected with similar-grade neoplasms, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) was observed, relative to the decrease rate of prostatic volume, between the patients with complete response and those with partial or no response. US monitoring of prostatic volume after radiotherapy, if correlated with histologic grading, can yield early predictive elements as to treatment outcome, thus contributing to select non-responsive patients to submit to biopsy and, if necessary, to therapeutic alternatives or combinations.

Patients are treated in a standing position using dual angled fields at a source to skin distance of 3.6 m. Dosimetric characteristics of the dual field technique were investigated for the 6-MeV beam as well as for a lower energy beam produced by the introduction of an acrylic beam degrader. A treatment stand, which incorporates the degrader in addition to devices used for patient support and shielding, is described. Acceptable beam uniformity and depth dose have been achieved while maintaining a low level of x-ray contamination. Treatment times are reasonably short since the output of the machine in the high-dose-rate mode is 25 Gy/min at the isocenter. Beam uniformity, dose rate, and x-ray contamination are relatively unaffected by the presence of the beam degrader if it is positioned near the treatment plane. The high dose-rate electron option is a useful treatment mode that provides the advantage of reduced treatment times while retaining proper functioning of all accelerator dosimetry systems and interlocks. Use of a dual field technique permits TSET in a treatment room of standard dimensions. The machine is easily set up for treatment, and patient setup is simplified through use of a customized support system

Studies have shown that the scatter radiation to the contralateral breast may play a large part in the induction of secondary breast cancers. Factors that may contribute to the contralateral breast dose may include the use of blocks, the orientation of the field, and wedges. Reports have shown that the use of regular wedges, particularly for the medial tangential field, gives a significantly higher dose to the contralateral breast compared to an open field. This paper compares the peripheral dose outside the field using a regular wedge, a dynamic wedge, and an open field technique. The data collected consisted of measurements taken with patients, solid water and a Rando phantom using a Varian 2300CD linear accelerator. Ion chambers, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), diodes, and films were the primary means for collecting the data. The measurements show that the peripheral dose outside the field using a dynamic wedge is close to that of open fields, and significantly lower than that of regular wedges. This information indicates that when using a medial wedge, a dynamic wedge should be used

The treatment of these tumors at Curie Institute has been done with cobalt plaques since 1968. Indications were first monophthalmic patients but are now much wide. We have been treating since 1981 all patients with tumor diameter less than 17 mm and tumor height less than 12 mm. The technic includes general anesthesia to place the disc with localisation of the tumor by transillumination or by indirect ophthalmoscopy. A dose of 70 to 90 grays is delivered to the apex of the tumor. We report two cases of patients treated by cobalt 60 plaque for choroidal melanoma. The first patient has a 5 mm high choroidal melanoma temporal to the macula. After treatment by cobalt plaque, he showed no echographic changes but angiograms revealed an hypofluorescent zone in the central part of the tumor. The second patient has an 8 mm tumor that after plaque showed only angiographic changes. Evolution after treatment of choroidal melanoma by radioactive plaque is variable. Echographic changes are very low and it is frequent to observe no modification in the height of the tumor for a long time for this reason, repeated angiograms can be very useful in the follow up of these patients. They frequently show hypofluorescent spot in the central part of a tumor that was hyperfluorescent before treatment. Sometimes there is diffuse lowering of the fluorescence. We think that these modifications of fluorescence can be due to diminution of the vascularisation of the tumor or may be to central necrosis of the tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

Both helium ion irradiation and 125I brachytherapy have been used to treat this neoplasm. This investigation analyzed the control and complication rates of uveal melanomas treated with helium ions of 125I plaques. In both a retrospective and a prospective dynamically balanced study, the control rates appeared to be similar. There were more posterior segment complications after 125I plaques and more anterior segment complications, including neovascular glaucoma, after helium ion irradiation. The follow-up period is too short to draw definitive conclusions on the radiation complications. Overall, approximately 89% of eyes were retained and less than 4% of treated eyes were removed because of failure to control the tumor

The treatment planning for dynamic radiosurgery is a three-dimensional problem, since during treatment both the gantry and the couch rotate simultaneously, the gantry from 30 degrees to 330 degrees and the couch from 75 degrees to - 75 degrees. The patient surface and anatomical information is obtained from a family of computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans, and a stereotactic frame is used for target localization, treatment setup, and patient immobilization during the treatment. The dose calculational algorithm follows the gantry and couch rotation in an incremental fashion, and relies on measured stationary beam central axis percentage depth doses and dose profiles to calculate the normalized tissue-maximum-ratio distributions over a matrix of points defined on one of three orthogonal planes (transverse, sagittal, or coronal).

1	1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

METHODS: From 1970 to 2001, 40 patients with primary tracheal carcinoma treated in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight were male and 12 were female with median age of 47 years. The median interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 10 months (1 - 60 months). Fifteen patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma, 14 squamous cell carcinoma, 8 adenocarcinoma, 2 small-cell carcinoma and 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Thirty-two patients received operation plus adjuvant radiotherapy, 6 received radiotherapy alone and 2 received operation alone. RESULTS: The median survival time for all patients was 40 months. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate was 86%, 59% and 29%, respectively. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year local control rate was 84%, 60% and 50%, respectively. Distant metastasis rate in 1, 5, and 10 years was 17%, 51% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy is a reasonable mode of treatment. Despite late local recurrence after initial treatment, its intrinsic feature, excellent long-term palliation can be achieved after treatment

AOVMs were located in the brainstem (19), thalamus or internal capsule (9), basal ganglia (3), deep cerebral hemisphere and motor area (3), or cerebellopontine angle (1). All patients presented with clinical and radiological evidence of previous hemorrhage, usually with multiple episodes of hemorrhage. Treatment volumes ranged from 80 to 15,200 mm3 and treatment doses from 7.7 to 34.6 Gy. Mean follow-up was 40 months, with 31 patients followed for at least 2 years. Clinical outcome was excellent in 46%, good in 34% and poor in 14%; 6% died. Twenty-seven patients in excellent and good condition prior to treatment remained stable or improved neurologically. Two patients initially in poor condition, who had previously received conventional radiotherapy, died at 9 and 14 months after treatment, respectively. Six patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage 2-60 months following treatment. Three of these patients made a complete recovery. Although a larger number of treated patients must be followed over longer periods of time, stereotactic heavy-particle radiotherapy may be a valuable treatment modality for surgically inaccessible intracranial AOVMs

We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding

These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding

METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 2000, 90 patients (median age, 51.3 yr; range, 10-85 yr; male/female ratio, 3:2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. Sixty-four patients had a chordoma, and 26 had a chondrosarcoma. The proton component was delivered by the 201-MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay. The median total dose delivered to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 cobalt Gray equivalents (range, 22-70 cobalt Gray equivalents). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 3-74 mo), treatment of 25 tumors failed locally. The 3-year local control rates were 69.2% (+/-6.0%) and 91.6% (+/-8.4%) for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, a small tumor volume excluded from the 95% isodose line (P = 0.032; relative risk [RR], 0.098; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.81) and a controlled tumor (P = 0.049; RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.99) were independent favorable prognostic factors for overall survival. On multivariate analysis, a high minimum dose (P = 0.02; RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.6), a high tumor control probability (P = 0.02; RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.5), a high dose delivered to 95% of the GTV (P = 0.03; RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.15-10.2), a high GTV encompassed by the 90% isodose line (P = 0.01; RR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.29-8.44), and a small GTV excluded from the 90% isodose line (P = 0.036; RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9) were independent favorable prognostic factors for local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the cranial base and cervical spine treated by surgical resection and then by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose uniformity within the GTV. Special attention must be paid to minimize underdosed areas because of the close proximity of critical structures and to redefine and possibly escalate dose constraints to tumor targets in future studies in view of the low toxicity observed to date

Several authors have described mixed or transitional vascular malformations with pathological features of more than one type of malformation within the same lesion. We present a rare case of a venous malformation associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with a loss of consciousness. Computed tomography showed an enlarged vein running along the lateral wall of the right lateral ventricle. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated an AVM and a venous malformation in the right hemisphere; the AVM and the venous malformation were located in proximity to each other with the AVM using the venous malformation as its draining vein. In this case, where an AVM used the venous malformation as the draining vein, only the AVM was treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated complete obliteration of the AVM with the venous malformation remaining unchanged. CONCLUSION: Arteriovenous shunting would have disturbed venous drainage resulting in the development of the venous malformation. Thus, in addition to demonstrating a rare coexistence of AVM and venous malformation, this case also offers a new insight into the pathogenesis of these vascular malformations. [References: 19]

CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma

This study introduces a statistical method of aggregating and analyzing primary data from DVHs and associated outcomes. It explores the dose-volume relationship for NTCP of the rectum, using long-term data on rectal wall bleeding following prostatic irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Previously published data were reviewed and updated on 41 patients with Stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma treated with photons followed by perineal proton boost, including dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of each patient's anterior rectal wall and data on the occurrence of postirradiation rectal bleeding (minimum FU > 4 years). Logistic regression was used to test whether some individual combination of dose and volume irradiated might best separate the DVHs into categories of high or low risk for rectal bleeding. Further analysis explored whether a group of such dose-volume combinations might be superior in predicting complication risk. These results were compared with results of the "critical volume model," a mathematical model based on assumptions of underlying radiobiological interactions. RESULTS: Ten of the 128 tested dose-volume combinations proved to be "statistically significant combinations" (SSCs) distinguishing between bleeders (14 out of 41) and nonbleeders (27 out of 41), ranging contiguously between 60 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) to 70% of the anterior rectal wall and 75 CGE to 30%. Calculated odds ratios for each SSC were not significantly different across the individual SSCs; however, analysis combining SSCs allowed segregation of DVHs into three risk groups: low, moderate, and high. Estimates of probabilities of normal tissue complications (NTCPs) based on these risk groups correlated strongly with observed data (p = 0.003) and with biomathematical model-generated NTCPs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose-volume relationship for rectal mucosal bleeding in the region between 60 and 75 CGE; therefore, efforts to spare rectal wall volume using improved treatment planning and delivery techniques are important. Stratifying dose-volume histograms (DVHs) into risk groups, as done in this study, represents a useful means of analyzing empirical data as a function of hetereogeneous dose distributions. Modeling efforts may extend these results to more heterogeneous treatment techniques. Such analysis of DVH data may allow practicing clinicians to better assess the risk of various treatments, fields, or doses, when caring for an individual patient

1	208	The impact of advanced technologies on treatment deviations in radiation treatment delivery	Humans, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Particle Accelerators/st [Standards], Prospective Studies, Quality Assurance,Health Care/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Technology,Radiologic/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic/st [Standards]	PURPOSE: To assess the impact of new technologies on deviation rates in radiation therapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment delivery deviations in RT were prospectively monitored during a time of technology upgrade. In January 2003, our department had three accelerators, none with "modern" technologies (e.g., without multileaf collimators [MLC]). In 2003 to 2004, we upgraded to five new accelerators, four with MLC, and associated advanced capabilities. The deviation rates among patients treated on "high-technology" versus "low-technology" machines (defined as those with vs. without MLC) were compared over time using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In 2003, there was no significant difference between the deviation rate in the "high-technology" versus "low-technology" groups (0.16% vs. 0.11%, p = 0.45). In 2005 to 2006, the deviation rate for the "high-technology" groups was lower than the "low-technology" (0.083% vs. 0.21%, p = 0.009). This difference was caused by a decline in deviations on the "high-technology" machines over time (p = 0.053), as well as an unexpected trend toward an increase in deviations over time on the "low-technology" machines (p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Advances in RT delivery systems appear to reduce the rate of treatment deviations. Deviation rates on "high-technology" machines with MLC decline over time, suggesting a learning curve after the introduction of new technologies. Associated with the adoption of "high-technology" was an unexpected increase in the deviation rate with "low-technology" approaches, which may reflect an over-reliance on tools inherent to "high-technology" machines. With the introduction of new technologies, continued diligence is needed to ensure that staff remain proficient with "low-technology" approaches

This study was to observe the abrogation of radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest of p53 mutated human cancer cell lines by 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), and explore the mechanism. METHODS: Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-1 and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line 973, both with p53 mutation, were used in this study. Human fibroblastoma cell line HT-1080 was used as control. Flow cytometry was used to observe the effects of irradiation on cell cycle of these 3 cell lines, and abrogation effect of UCN-01 on radiation-induced G(2) phase arrest. Western blot was used to detect phosphorylated CDC2-Tyr15 during the abrogation process. RESULTS: Irradiation resulted in G(2) phase arrest in CNE-1 cells and 973 cells. Proportion of cells in G(2) phase increased from 18.4% to 43.6% in CNE-1 cell line, and from 14.8% to 42.8% in 973 cell line after 2 Gy of irradiation. G(1) phase arrests, measured by "S phase cells consumption", of CNE-1 cells and 973 cells were much lower than that of HT-1080 cells (14.8% and -1.2% vs. 57.0%). Radiation-induced G(2) phase arrests were abrogated by UCN-01 from 63.5% to 16.1% in CNE-1 cell line, and from 35.4% to 16.3% in 973 cell line. UCN-01 suppressed the expression of radiation-induced phosphorylation of CDC2-Tyr15, which was in accordance with the abrogation of radiation-induced G(2) phase delay. CONCLUSIONS: Main effect of irradiation on cell cycle of p53 mutated CNE-1 cells and 973 cells is G(2) phase arrest. UCN-01 is able to abrogate radiation-induced G(2) phase, which is associated with the reduction of phosphorylated CDC2-Tyr15

This last decade has seen a rapid proliferation in the development of the methodology which is certainly related in part to the simultaneous growth of high-resolution neuro-imaging techniques. By focusing the beams of 201 hemispherically arrayed cobalt 60 sources, the gamma-knife delivers a high dose of radiation to a small target. Another possibility proposed by several authors is the bragg peak cyclotron-generated irradiation with accelerated protons or helium ions. In Lille, since 1988, we have chosen to develop stereotactic radiosurgery, according to the system of Betti, by the association of Talairach's stereotactic methodology and external single-dose encephalic irradiation with high energy X-rays, delivered by means of a linear accelerator. The major indication for the use of this method is an arteriovenous malformation. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be proposed alone or in combination with surgery and embolisation. It has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment and an attractive alternative in carefully selected patients with intracranial tumours: slow-growing, well limited, deep-seated tumours, such as some gliomas, acoustic neurinomas, skull base meningiomas, pituitary adenomas. This treatment is also used to deliver a focal boost of radiation to previously administered fractionated radiotherapy in patients with small gliomas and solitary brain metastases

The aim was to provide maximal local tumor control while minimizing complications such as cranial nerve injuries. METHODS: Thirty-one acoustic neuromas in 30 patients were treated with proton beam therapy from March 1991 to June 1999. The mean tumor volume was 4.3 cm(3). All patients underwent pretreatment neurological evaluation, contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and audiometric evaluation. Standard fractionated proton radiotherapy was used at daily doses of 1.8 to 2.0 cobalt Gray equivalent: patients with useful hearing before treatment (Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II) received 54.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 fractions; patients without useful hearing received 60.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 to 33 fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 30 patients were assessable for tumor control and cranial nerve injury. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 98 months (mean, 34 mo), during which no patients demonstrated disease progression on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Eleven patients demonstrated radiographic regression. Of the 13 patients with pretreatment Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II hearing, 4 (31%) maintained useful hearing. No transient or permanent treatment-related trigeminal or facial nerve dysfunction was observed.

The aim was to provide maximal local tumor control while minimizing complications such as cranial nerve injuries. METHODS: Thirty-one acoustic neuromas in 30 patients were treated with proton beam therapy from March 1991 to June 1999. The mean tumor volume was 4.3 cm(3). All patients underwent pretreatment neurological evaluation, contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and audiometric evaluation. Standard fractionated proton radiotherapy was used at daily doses of 1.8 to 2.0 cobalt Gray equivalent: patients with useful hearing before treatment (Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II) received 54.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 fractions; patients without useful hearing received 60.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 to 33 fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 30 patients were assessable for tumor control and cranial nerve injury. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 98 months (mean, 34 mo), during which no patients demonstrated disease progression on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Eleven patients demonstrated radiographic regression. Of the 13 patients with pretreatment Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II hearing, 4 (31%) maintained useful hearing. No transient or permanent treatment-related trigeminal or facial nerve dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSION: Fractionated proton beam therapy provided excellent local control of acoustic neuromas when treatment was administered in moderate doses. No injuries to the Vth or VIIth cranial nerves were observed. A reduction in the tumor dose is being evaluated to increase the hearing preservation rate

The model illustrates the relationships among the relevant variables: the patient waiting time, the number on the waiting list, the rate at which requests for radiation therapy are received and the rate at which courses of treatment are commenced. In particular, the rate at which the waiting time increases is equal to the difference between the request rate and the start rate, expressed as a fraction of the start rate, and is therefore a measure of the deficiency in service capacity of a facility. A study of the records of patients treated on the linear accelerators of the Tom Baker Cancer Centre from January 1991 to June 1994 shows that this relationship holds to a high degree of accuracy for average values of the various parameters in spite of the considerable variation in these values, and particularly variation in the individual waiting times. This finding suggests that such an approach would be useful in assessing and comparing the performance of radiation therapy facilities

1	3414	Neon ion radiotherapy: results of the phase I/II clinical trial	California, Californium, Cell Cycle, Drug Evaluation, Head, Humans, Ions, Lung, Male, Neck, Neon, Neon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oxygen, Prostate, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Retrospective Studies, Sarcoma, Survival, Survivors, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	Neon ion radiotherapy possesses biologic and physical advantages over megavoltage X rays. Biologically, the neon beam reduces the oxygen enhancement ratio and increases relative biological effectiveness. Cells irradiated by neon ions show less variation in cell-cycle related radiosensitivity and decreased repair of radiation injury. The physical behavior of heavy charged particles allows precise delivery of high radiation doses to tumors while minimizing irradiation of normal tissues. In 1979 a Phase I-II clinical trial was started at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory using neon ions to irradiate patients for whom conventional treatment modalities were ineffective. By the end of 1988 a total of 239 patients had received a minimum neon physical dose of 1000 cGy (median follow-up for survivors 32 months). Compared with historical results, the 5-year actuarial disease-specific survival (DSS5) and local control (LC5) rates suggest that neon treatment improves outcome for several types of tumors: a) advanced or recurrent macroscopic salivary gland carcinomas (DSS5 59%; LC5 61%); b) paranasal sinus tumors (DSS5 69%; LC5 69% for macroscopic disease); c) advanced soft tissue sarcomas (DSS5 56%, LC5 56% for macroscopic disease); d) macroscopic sarcomas of bone (DSS5 45%; LC5 59%); e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas (DSS5 90%; LC5 75%); and f) biliary tract carcinomas (DSS5 28%; LC5 44%). Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, lung, and advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer has been less successful; results for these tumors appear no better than those achieved with conventional x-ray therapy. These findings suggest that Phase III trials using the neon beam should be implemented for selected malignancies

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

Some commonly used formulas for predicting risk are based on extrapolation from small numbers of animal experiments, pilot human treatment series, and theoretical radiobiological considerations. The authors studied the incidence of complications after AVM radiosurgery in relation to dose, volume, and other factors in a large patient series. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in 1329 patients with AVM treated by Dr. Raymond Kjellberg at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between 1965 and 1993. Dose and volume were obtained from HCL records, and information about patient follow up was derived from concurrent clinical records, questionnaires, and contact with referring physicians. Multivariate logistic regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals was used. Follow up was available in 1250 patients (94%); the median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. The median radiation dose was 10.5 Gy and the median treatment volume was 33.7 cm(3). Twenty-three percent of treated lesions were smaller than 10 cm(3). Fifty-one permanent radiation-related deficits occurred (4.1%). Of 1043 patients treated with a dose predicted by the Kjellberg isoeffective centile curve to have a less than 1% complication risk, 1.8% suffered radiation-related complications. Actual complication rates were 4.7% for 128 patients treated at Kjellberg risk centile doses of 1 to 1.8%, and 34% for 61 patients treated at risk centile doses of 2 to 2.5%. The fitted logistic model showed that complication risk was related to treatment dose and volume, thalamic or brainstem location, and patient age. CONCLUSIONS: The Kjellberg isoeffective risk centile curve significantly underpredicted actual risks of permanent complications after proton beam radiosurgery for AVMs. Actual risks were best predicted using a model that accounted for treatment dose and volume, lesion location, and patient age

Some commonly used formulas for predicting risk are based on extrapolation from small numbers of animal experiments, pilot human treatment series, and theoretical radiobiological considerations. The authors studied the incidence of complications after AVM radiosurgery in relation to dose, volume, and other factors in a large patient series. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in 1329 patients with AVM treated by Dr. Raymond Kjellberg at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between 1965 and 1993. Dose and volume were obtained from HCL records, and information about patient follow up was derived from concurrent clinical records, questionnaires, and contact with referring physicians. Multivariate logistic regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals was used. Follow up was available in 1250 patients (94%); the median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. The median radiation dose was 10.5 Gy and the median treatment volume was 33.7 cm(3). Twenty-three percent of treated lesions were smaller than 10 cm(3). Fifty-one permanent radiation-related deficits occurred (4.1%). Of 1043 patients treated with a dose predicted by the Kjellberg isoeffective centile curve to have a less than 1% complication risk, 1.8% suffered radiation-related complications. Actual complication rates were 4.7% for 128 patients treated at Kjellberg risk centile doses of 1 to 1.8%, and 34% for 61 patients treated at risk centile doses of 2 to 2.5%. The fitted logistic model showed that complication risk was related to treatment dose and volume, thalamic or brainstem location, and patient age.

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons

These were reviewed at a minimum follow-up of three years to determine the effect of irradiation on infection, the complications and the functional result. No bacteriological infection was seen in the 44 patients who had allografts for revision of joint arthroplasty or for a tumour with no adjuvant therapy. For the 83 patients who also had chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both for a bone tumour, the rate of infection was 13%. The major mechanical complications were nonunion in seven grafts (5.5%) and fracture in eight (6%). These rates do not differ greatly from those reported for non-irradiated grafts. Our results suggest that irradiation, which remains the most convenient and acceptable method of sterilisation, does not jeopardize the clinical results

The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described. [References: 15]	
0	427	4D MR imaging of respiratory organ motion and its variability	Algorithms, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional/mt [Methods], Liver/pa [Pathology], Lung/pa [Pathology], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Models,Statistical, Motion, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted, Research, Respiration, Retrospective Studies, Subtraction Technique, Switzerland	This paper describes a method for 4D imaging, which is used to study respiratory organ motion, a key problem in various treatments. Whilst the commonly used imaging methods rely on simplified breathing patterns to acquire one breathing cycle, the proposed method was developed to study irregularities in organ motion during free breathing over tens of minutes. The method does not assume a constant breathing depth or even strict periodicity and does not depend on an external respiratory signal. Time-resolved 3D image sequences were reconstructed by retrospective stacking of dynamic 2D images using internal image-based sorting. The generic method is demonstrated for the liver and for the lung. Quantitative evaluations of the volume consistency show the advantages over one-dimensional measurements for image sorting. Dense deformation fields describing the respiratory motion were estimated from the reconstructed volumes using non-rigid 3D registration. All obtained motion fields showed variations in the range of minutes such as drifts and deformations, which changed both the exhalation position of the liver and the breathing pattern. The obtained motion data are used in proton therapy planning to evaluate dose delivery methodologies with respect to their motion sensitivity. Besides this application, the new possibilities of studying respiratory motion are valuable for other applications such as the evaluation of gating techniques with respect to residual motion

PD measurements were also carried out under identical conditions for seven patients treated for head and neck and cervical cancer employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The measured PD from these patient-specific intensity-modulated beams (IMBs) were compared with the corresponding data from uniform DMLC fields having similar jaws setting. The measured PD per monitor unit (PD/MU) decreases almost exponentially with out-of-field distance for all uniform DMLC and static fields. For the same strip field width of 1.2 cm, uniform DMLC fields with a larger size of 14 x 22 cm2 deliver an average of 3.51 (SD = 0.51) times higher PD/MU at all out-of-field distances compared to 6 x 6 cm2. Similar to uniform DMLC fields, PD/MU measured from different patient-specific IMBs was found to decrease almost exponentially with out-of-field distance and increase with increase in field dimension. PD per MU from uniform DMLC fields and patient-specific IMBs having similar jaws setting shows good agreement (+/-7%) except at the most proximal distance, where a variation of more than 10% (maximum 15%) was observed. Our study shows that PD data generated from uniform DMLC fields can be used as baseline data to estimate out-of-field critical organ or whole-body dose in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT if an appropriate correction factor for field dimension is applied. The whole-body dose information can be used to estimate the possible increase in risk of fatal secondary malignancy in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT

1	3728	Radiation therapy for arteriovenous malformations: a review.[see comment]. [Review] [65 refs]	Boston, Brain, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Massachusetts, Mortality, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Recurrence, Research	There have been numerous case reports and series of patients treated with partial brain irradiation, linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and Bragg peak therapy for inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These cases are summarized and compared. There is convincing evidence that radiation therapy does have a role in obliterating carefully chosen inoperable lesions. The changes that occur in vessel walls after radiation are reviewed. Data about x-ray and gamma radiation are mostly historical and difficult to evaluate because of the techniques of partial brain irradiation. There is a lack of data about the volume of AVM treated and the minimum dose delivered to the AVM nidus. For gamma knife, heavy particle, and linear accelerator therapy, more complete data are available. The incidence of hemorrhage during the first 2 years after treatment, when radiation-induced vascular changes are proposed to occur, is approximately 2.6% per year for gamma knife therapy, 2% per year for proton beam therapy, 2.3% per year for helium beam therapy, and 2.3% per year for linear accelerator therapy. These rates are similar to the recurrence rate for hemorrhage of 2.2 to 3% per year expected based on the natural history of untreated AVMs. If AVM obliteration after therapy is not achieved, the incidence of recurrent hemorrhage remains between 2% per year after treatment with gamma knife therapy. The incidence of hemorrhage for all patients treated was reported as 0.15% per year in one study and 20% over 8 years in a follow-up study using proton beam therapy. Mortality from hemorrhage after treatment was 0.6% after gamma knife therapy, 2.3% after helium beam therapy, and 2 to 5% after proton beam therapy. These figures for mortality are all lower than the 11% observed for the natural history of untreated AVMs. Permanent neurological deficits experienced as a complication of radiation occurred in 2 to 3% of patients treated with gamma knife therapy, 4% of patients treated with helium beam therapy, 1.7% of patients treated with proton beam therapy, and 3% of patients treated with stereotactic linear accelerator therapy. Proton beam therapy has been used for both small and large lesions. The majority of lesions in patients treated with gamma knife, helium beam, and linear accelerator therapy have been small (usually less than 3.0 cm average diameter) lesions. In these patients with small inoperable lesions treated with accurately directed fields of isocentric radiation, the greatest incidence of AVM obliteration has been observed on follow-up angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 65]

In order to improve outcomes, we sought to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of sstr-targeted high-LET alpha-emitting (213)Bi to that of low-LET beta(-)-emitting (177)Lu by determining relative biological effectiveness (RBE) using the external gamma-beam of (137)Cs as reference radiation. METHODS: Sstr-expressing human pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-2 cells and A549 control cells were used for this study. The effects of different radiation doses of (213)Bi and (177)Lu labeled to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid and sstr-targeted DOTATOC were investigated with a clonogenic cell survival assay. Apoptosis was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISA(PLUS) 10x kit. RESULTS: Using equimolar DOTATOC treatment with concurrent irradiation with a (137)Cs source as reference radiation, the calculated RBE of [(213)Bi]DOTATOC was 3.4, as compared to 1.0 for [(177)Lu]DOTATOC. As measured in terms of absorbance units, [(213)Bi]DOTATOC caused a 2.3-fold-greater release of apoptosis-specific mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes than [(177)Lu]DOTATOC at the final treatment time of 96 h (P<.001) in sstr-expressing Capan-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, at the same absorbed dose, [(213)Bi]DOTATOC is therapeutically more effective in decreasing survival than is [(177)Lu]DOTATOC in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells due to its comparatively higher RBE

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 1997 to November 2000, 37 patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ions at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at GSI, Darmstadt. Tumor-conformal application of carbon beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning in combination with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. The treatment planning procedure included a biological plan optimization. We applied a cobalt-Gray equivalent dose of 60GyE. Acute toxicity was assessed according to the common toxicity criteria (CTC). RESULTS: Acute toxicity included skin reactions ( degrees I+ degrees II) in four patients, mucositis ( degrees I- degrees III) in eight patients, otitis and middle ear effusion in four, sinusitis in four, nausea/weight loss in one and edema of the temporal lobes in one patient. In two patients, preexisting neurological symptoms worsened. We did not observe acute morbidity > degrees III of normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Scanning beam delivery of heavy charged particles is safe and reliable. No unexpected acute dose limiting toxicity was observed. With regard to toxicity, a substantial improvement compared to passive beam shaping technology is achieved

We developed an efficient leaf sequencing method to eliminate leaf end abutment for segmental IMRT delivery. Our method uses simple matrix and sorting operations to obtain a solution that simultaneously minimizes total monitor units and number of segments without leaf end abutment between segments. We implemented and demonstrated our method for multiple clinical cases. We compared the results of our method with the results from exhaustive search method. We found that our solution without leaf end abutment produced equivalent results to the unconstrained solutions in terms of minimum total monitor units and minimum number of leaf segments. We conclude that the leaf end abutment fields can be avoided without affecting the efficiency of segmental IMRT delivery. The major strength of our method is its simplicity and high computing speed. This potentially provides a useful means for generating segmental IMRT fields that require high spatial resolution or complex intensity distributions

On the basis of this analysis, it is concluded that the induction of lens opacity should not be the factor limiting intake of any radioisotope of Pu or for 224Ra or 226Ra.

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

0	4126	Measurement of total body nitrogen and oxygen by irradiation with cyclotron neutrons and 'delayed' gamma ray counting	Body Composition, Gamma Rays, Half-Life, Humans, Methods, Neutrons, Nitrogen, Nitrogen/an [Analysis], Oxygen, Oxygen/an [Analysis], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation]	Measurement of total body nitrogen is assuming increasing importance in the nutritional evaluation of seriously ill patients. Nitrogen has been previously measured either by counting (i) the annihilation radiation from 13N immediately after neutron irradiation with 14 MeV neutrons or (ii) the 'prompt' gamma rays from thermal neutron capture by 14N during irradiation with 14 MeV neutrons or with those produced by isotopic sources or a cyclotron. The present work describes studies into the feasibility of measuring 13N produced by irradiation with a neutron beam from the MRC Cyclotron. A complication of this method is that 13N is also produced in a reaction with 16O. Direct measurement of oxygen by use of the reactions 16O(n, p)16N or 16O(n, 2n)15O enables this interference to be estimated. The former reaction is possible with both 14 meV and cyclotron-produced neutrons but the 7.1 s half-life of 16N requires detectors to be placed in or very close to the irradiation site. In our particular circumstances this is not possible but the more energetic cyclotron neutron spectrum allows the production of 15O which has a half-life of 2.05 min and can be measured in a remote whole-body counter. A disadvantage with the cyclotron beam, in comparison with 14 MeV neutrons, is that a higher dose is required for similar accuracy. A reproducibility of about 4% is obtained with a dose equivalent of 0.01 Sv

One objective of the measurements was to determine if the increases were related to changing from film dosimeters exchanged monthly to TLD-100 dosimeters exchanged quarterly. While small increases were observed in the dose equivalents of most employees, the dose equivalents of personnel operating medical electron linear accelerators with energies greater than 20 MV doubled coincidentally with the change in the personnel dosimeter program. The measurements indicated a small thermal neutron radiation component around the accelerators operated by these personnel. This component caused the doses measured with the TLD-100 dosimeters to be overstated. Therefore, the increase in these personnel dose equivalents was not due to changes in work habits or radiation environments. Either film or TLD-700 dosimeters would be suitable for personnel monitoring around high-energy linear accelerators. The final choice would depend on economics and personal preference

We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT

In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT	
1	2968	Verification of electron beam therapy with conventional and storage phosphor images: preliminary experience	Anatomy, Electrons, Humans, Luminescent Measurements, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Technology,Radiologic, Universities	Portal verification images were generated by the photon contamination in electron beams produced by a linear accelerator during treatment of patients receiving high-energy electron radiation therapy. Both conventional and storage phosphor methods yielded projection radiographs in which anatomy of the irradiated and surrounding tissue was demonstrated. Exposed phantoms were used to confirm that the images represent a true projection of the radiation field. A preliminary series of 22 cases was evaluated by two radiotherapists and judged subjectively to be of clinical value. Geometric error, or more importantly, the lack thereof, during high-energy electron treatments was easily confirmed with this method. In three cases, the treatment protocol was corrected based on the images obtained. Because the readout process of storage phosphor images allows for gain adjustments and post-processing, the images obtained with this method were found to delineate anatomy in the treated and surrounding tissues somewhat more consistently than could conventional images

Most published experience relates to the use of the gamma knife. In this report, the authors review the methods and results of linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery in 44 patients with acoustic neuromas who were treated between 1993 and 1997. METHODS: Computerized tomography scanning was selected as the stereotactic imaging modality for target definition. A single, conformally shaped isocenter was used in the treatment of 40 patients; two or three isocenters were used in four patients who harbored very irregular tumors. The radiation dose directed to the tumor border was the only parameter that changed during the study period: in the first 24 patients who were treated the dose was 15 to 20 Gy, whereas in the last 20 patients the dose was reduced to 11 to 14 Gy. After a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 12-60 months), 98% of the tumors were controlled. The actuarial hearing preservation rate was 71%. New transient facial neuropathy developed in 24% of the patients and persisted to a mild degree in 8%. Radiation dose correlated significantly with the incidence of cranial neuropathy, particularly in large tumors (> or = 4 cm3). CONCLUSIONS: Single-isocenter LINAC radiosurgery proved to be an effective treatment for acoustic neuromas in this series, with results that were comparable with those reported for gamma knife radiosurgery and multiple isocenters

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In June 1999, the Society ordered an analysis of the state of radiation oncology. It created a survey that was sent to all radiotherapy units in Spain. A database was created in which 230 variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-four centers were analyzed, and 157 external beam irradiation, megavoltage units were counted, of which 67 were cobalt units and 90 were linear accelerators. The cobalt units worked an average of 11.4 h daily and the linear accelerators 11.6 h. The number of patients/unit/y was 472 for the cobalt units and 442 for the linear accelerators. The number of patients by physician and year was 179. Each center received a mean of 958 new patients annually. The average between the reception and start of treatment was 25.52 days (maximum 60), and it was estimated that only 38.1% of cancers were irradiated. The number of radiation oncologists working was 392. Spain has a deficit of 297 radiation oncologists. CONCLUSION: There is a need for 44 MV units and for the replacement of 67 cobalt units. The present lack of units has had an impact on palliative treatment, which has resulted in pharmacy costs. As long as these instrumental deficiencies are not solved, waiting lists will continue to be inherent to the system. There are also important staff deficiencies, in that about 297 radiation oncologists would be needed to cover the needs

We call this system "three-dimensional conformal setup" (3D-CSU). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three 2.0-mm gold markers are inserted into or adjacent to the CTV. On the treatment couch, the actual positions of the three markers are calculated based on two orthogonal fluoroscopies crossing at the isocenter of the linear accelerator. Discrepancy of the actual coordinates of gravity center of three markers from its planned coordinates is calculated. Translational setup error is corrected by adjustment of the treatment couch. The rotation angles (alpha, beta, gamma) of the coordinates of the actual CTV relative to the planned CTV are calculated around the lateral (x), craniocaudal (y), and anteroposterior (z) axes of the planned CTV. The angles of the gantry head, collimator, and treatment couch of the linear accelerator are adjusted according to the rotation of the actual coordinates of the tumor in relation to the planned coordinates. We have measured the accuracy of 3D-CSU using a static cubic phantom. RESULTS: The gravity center of the phantom was corrected within 0.9 +/- 0.3 mm (mean +/- SD), 0.4 +/- 0.2 mm, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm for the rotation of the phantom from 0-30 degrees around the x, y, and z axes, respectively, every 5 degrees. Dose distribution was shown to be consistent with the planned dose distribution every 10 degrees of the rotation from 0-30 degrees. The mean rotational error after 3D-CSU was -0.4 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SD), -0.2 +/- 0.4, and 0.0 +/- 0.5 degrees around the x, y, and z axis, respectively, for the rotation from 0-90 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Phantom studies showed that 3D-CSU is useful for performing rotational correction of the target volume without correcting the position of the patient on the treatment couch. The 3D-CSU will be clinically useful for tumors in structures such as paraspinal diseases and prostate cancers not subject to large internal organ motion

IN TISSUES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT INHOMOGENETIES DUE TO BONE AND AIR SPACES WE HAVE DELIVEREDA WELL-DEFINED DOSE TO INVOLVED TISSUES WHILE SPARING DISTAL SENSITIVE STRUCTURES.

Conventional MR imaging, however, cannot always depict treatment-induced transient WM abnormalities. We investigated the ability of diffusion-tensor (DT) MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy to detect the treatment-induced transient changes within normal-appearing WM. METHODS: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed in 8 patients treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for brain tumors (17 examinations) and 11 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, fractional anisotropy (FA) value, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio were obtained from 27 hemispheres with normal-appearing WM in the patients. We divided the datasets of isotropic ADC, FA, and NAA/Cr, on the basis of the time period after completion of radiation therapy, into 4 groups: group 1 (0-2 months; n = 10), group 2 (3-5 months; n = 5), group 3 (6-9 months; n = 7), and group 4 (10-12 months; n = 5). We compared averages of mean isotropic ADC, mean FA, and NAA/Cr of each patient group with those of the control group by using a t test. RESULTS: In the group 2, averages of mean FA and NAA/Cr decreased and average of mean isotopic ADC increased in comparison with those of the control group (P = .004, .04, and .0085, respectively). There were no significant differences in the averages between the control group and patient groups 1, 3, and 4.

The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient).

[Review] [36 refs]	Bone Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Bone Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/su [Surgery], Germany, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Lead, Melanoma, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	BACKGROUND: In the treatment of brain metastases using a stereotactically modified linear accelerator it could be shown that a single dose between 15 and 25 Gy leads to partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from melanoma and hypernephroma. Radiosurgery of brain metastases then started in centers all over the world, however, experiences with brain metastases of renal cell carcinoma are yet limited. The aim of this analysis is therefore to present the treatment results of radiosurgery of brain metastases. Furthermore, in this paper prognostic subgroups shall be defined, in order to establish guidelines for an optimal therapy strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiosurgery means stereotactically guided high-precision irradiation methods by extremely focussing ionizing radiation within the target volume as a single dose application. The characteristic steep dose decrease allows the selective destruction of small intracranial lesions, while the surrounding brain tissue is optimally protected. Two methods, Gamma Knife and stereotactic modified linear accelerator are clinically available. RESULTS: In larger studies from different groups all over the world, local tumor control rates from 85% to 95%, recurrence rates from 6% to 15% and side effects between 3% and 15% have been attained, independent of the system used. Prognostic factors, like volume of metastases < 10 ml, applied dose > 18 Gy, one or two metastases, absence of extracranial metastases, good patient performance with a Karnofsky score > 70%, primary treatment and more than one year between primary diagnosis and brain metastases showed a trend toward improved survival. Depending on the prognostic factors the median survival after radiosurgery ranged from 6 to 12 months. Retrospective comparison of radiosurgery and surgical series suggest that both modalities attain similar results. The dose can be applied with an accuracy of 0.3 mm. DISCUSSION: Based on these experiences, brain metastases can be treated by radiosurgery, primarily in patients with one or two metastases or in combination with whole brain irradiation as a boost in patients with more than two metastases. Furthermore with radiosurgery a new treatment modality exists to re-irradiate patients who have been failed after surgery or whole brain irradiation. [References: 36]

Functional imaging of tumor metabolism can help with this task, but the choice of tracer is still controversial. This prospective study following up irradiated low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) was, to our knowledge, the first receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis that intraindividually evaluated the diagnostic performance of the SPECT tracers 3-[(123)I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT) and (99m)Tc(I)-hexakis(2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile) (MIBI) and the PET tracer (18)F-FDG. METHODS: We examined 17 patients, initially with histologically proven LGA and treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, who presented with new gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhancing lesions (n = 26) on MRI. At that time, MRI could not differentiate between progressive tumor and nonprogressive tumor. This MRI examination was closely followed by (18)F-FDG PET and by (99m)Tc-MIBI and (123)I-IMT SPECT. Lesions were classified as progressive tumor (n = 17) or nonprogressive tumor (n = 9) on the basis of prospective follow-up (through clinical examination, MRI, and proton MR spectroscopy) for 26.6 +/- 6.6 mo after PET or SPECT. RESULTS: (123)I-IMT yielded the best ROC characteristics and was the most accurate for classification, with an area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.991. The A(z) of (18)F-FDG (0.947) was not significantly lower than that of (123)I-IMT. The difference in the A(z) of (99m)Tc-MIBI (0.713) from the A(z) of the other tracers used in our study was highly significant (P </= 0.01). (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of low accuracy and, especially, of poor sensitivity even at modest specificity values. CONCLUSION: (123)I-IMT SPECT imaging of amino acid transport accurately detects tumor progression in patients with irradiated LGA. In contrast to (123)I-IMT, (18)F-FDG PET was slightly less accurate for classification, and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of limited value. Imaging of amino acid transport with (123)I-IMT is a valuable additional tool for the follow-up of LGA, allowing early, noninvasive differentiation of lesions with ambiguous morphology after irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1976 and 1992, 167 men with stages T3 to 4 prostate cancer were treated on protocol with 50.4 Gy. photons at 1.8 Gy. per fraction using a 4-field box arrangement, followed by a conformal perineal proton boost of 27 Gy. (cobalt Gy. equivalent) in 11 fractions. The chart was reviewed and 39 of the 42 surviving patients were interviewed. Median followup was 13.1 years (range 7 to 23). Normal tissue morbidity was recorded using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and the late effects normal tissue scale. RESULTS: The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater genitourinary morbidity was 59% at 15 years. However, these grade 2 or greater problems persisted to the time of the interview in only 7 of 39 cases. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater hematuria was 21% at 5 years and 47% at 15. For grade 3 or greater hematuria the risk was 3% and 8% at 5 and 15 years, respectively. No patient required cystectomy but 1 required diversion for morbidity. Urethral stricture and urinary incontinence with pads needed developed in 4 and 3 men, respectively. This particular morbidity was strongly associated with previous or subsequent prostate surgery. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal morbidity was 13% at 5 and 15 years, while grade 1 rectal bleeding occurred in another 41%. CONCLUSIONS: High dose conformal radiation to the prostate is followed by a high rate of low grade rectal bleeding but a low rate of grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal morbidity. This rate is stable and does not increase beyond 5 years. Genitourinary morbidity continues to develop well into the second decade after treatment, although high grade morbidity is uncommon. These findings do not suggest that the modern trend toward high dose prostate treatment with conformal techniques will result in a high incidence of serious and permanent late sequelae but it appears that hematuria will be common

Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

A group of 31 patients treated with iridium was opposed to a historical control group of 24 patients treated with radium. Both groups were submitted to the same method of simultaneous percutaneous irradiation. All consecutively treated patients exposed to a percutaneous focal dose of greater than 45 Gy were evaluated. The iridium and radium doses applied as well as the values measured in intestine and bladder are presented. The iridium group had the same or a slightly less favorable prognosis (prognostic factors compared: stage, percutaneous dose, histology, age) than the radium group. The remission rates were identical for both therapy methods. Patients treated with iridium have a slightly better curve of recurrence-free interval and survival time, even taking into consideration the shorter observation period. Two out of the patients treated with iridium and four out of those treated with radium presented severe long-term side effects with formation of fistulas (average incidence 12,5 months and 12,7 months after the beginning of therapy, respectively)

Two X-ray plans (3-field, 6-field) and a 2-field proton plan were made and compared for each of 20 T3 prostate patients with the aid of the 3D planning system VOXELPLAN. Dose distributions were analysed in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVH). Tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were computed using our own and the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models, respectively. The study shows that on average the proton technique results in the best dose distribution, giving the lowest rectal complication probability, and also that the 3-field X-ray technique is more effective than the 6-field X-ray technique in sparing the rectum. At 5% rectal NTCP, the predicted proton average TCP for the 20 patients is 2% (in absolute terms) greater than that obtained using 3-field X-ray therapy. For 7 of the patients the gain in TCP is more than 3%. For the same rectal NTCP as the 3-field X-ray plan with a 64 Gy mean target dose, the use of protons increases the TCP by 2% on average, but for 5 of the patients the increases are greater than 4%. The result is in general positive towards the use of protons but a few patients do not benefit from it and this indicates the importance of patient selection for maximum clinical benefit

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children treated with protons at Loma Linda University Medical Center between August 1991 and December 1994 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight children, aged 1 to 18 years, were identified as at risk for brain injury from treatment. Medical records, physical examinations, and correspondence with patients, their parents, and referring physicians were analyzed. The investigators tabulated post-treatment changes in pre-treatment signs and symptoms and made judgments as to whether improvement, no change, or worsening related to disease or treatment had supervened. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with clinical findings and radiographic impressions were tabulated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 7 to 49 months (median 25 months). Four instances of treatment-related morbidity were identified. Forty-one instances of site-specific, disease-related morbidity were identified: 15 improved or resolved and 26 remained unchanged after treatment. Four patients had radiographic evidence of local failure. Three of these patients, including two with high-grade glioma, have died. CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related morbidity associated with proton therapy is low. Tumor progression remains a problem when treating certain histologies such as high-grade glioma. Escalating the dose delivered to target volumes may benefit children with tumors associated with poor rates of local control. Long-term follow-up, including neurocognitive testing, is in progress to assess integral-dose effects on cognitive, behavioral and developmental outcomes in children with cranial tumors

1	3550	Proton therapy for pediatric cranial tumors: preliminary report on treatment and disease-related morbidities	Adolescent, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/co [Complications], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Medical Records, Methods, Morbidity, Physical Examination, Pituitary Neoplasms/co [Complications], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Seizures/et [Etiology], Universities	PURPOSE: Accelerated protons were used in an attempt to limit treatment-related morbidity in children with tumors in or near the developing brain, by reducing the integral dose to adjacent normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children treated with protons at Loma Linda University Medical Center between August 1991 and December 1994 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight children, aged 1 to 18 years, were identified as at risk for brain injury from treatment. Medical records, physical examinations, and correspondence with patients, their parents, and referring physicians were analyzed. The investigators tabulated post-treatment changes in pre-treatment signs and symptoms and made judgments as to whether improvement, no change, or worsening related to disease or treatment had supervened. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with clinical findings and radiographic impressions were tabulated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 7 to 49 months (median 25 months). Four instances of treatment-related morbidity were identified. Forty-one instances of site-specific, disease-related morbidity were identified: 15 improved or resolved and 26 remained unchanged after treatment. Four patients had radiographic evidence of local failure. Three of these patients, including two with high-grade glioma, have died. CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related morbidity associated with proton therapy is low. Tumor progression remains a problem when treating certain histologies such as high-grade glioma. Escalating the dose delivered to target volumes may benefit children with tumors associated with poor rates of local control. Long-term follow-up, including neurocognitive testing, is in progress to assess integral-dose effects on cognitive, behavioral and developmental outcomes in children with cranial tumors

It is therefore desirable to minimize treatment time and hospitalisation. Aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility of a reduction of treatment time by accelerated fractionation. Out of 110 patients treated for glioblastoma from 1975 to 1988 in our institution postoperative radiation was performed in 79 patients using three different fractionation schedules: 60 Gy in six weeks, single fractions 2 Gy (n = 38), 35 Gy in two weeks, single fractions 3.5 Gy (n = 27), 45.5 Gy in 2.5 weeks, single fractions 3.5 Gy (n = 14). No statistically significant differences in both the mean overall and disease free survival were evaluated between the three groups. The larger fraction size was well tolerated and no relevant increase of early or late adverse reactions occurred. As the duration of treatment can be reduced from six to two weeks, this accelerated fractionation schedule seems to be a reasonable alternative to conventional fractionation

0	1358	Impact of a micromultileaf collimator on stereotactic radiotherapy of uveal melanoma	Austria, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/su [Surgery], Optic Nerve, Particle Accelerators, Radiobiology, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a micro multileaf collimator (mMLC) on Linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of uveal melanoma by comparing circular arc with static conformal, dynamic arc, and intensity-modulated SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty uveal melanoma patients were selected from approximately 100 patients treated with SRT since 1996. For each patient, four treatment plans (BrainSCAN XL, V5.0) were made: conventional arc, static conformal, dynamic arc plan, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The goal of treatment planning was to fully encompass the planning target volume (PTV) by the 80% isodose while minimizing doses to the optic nerve and lens. The following parameters were evaluated: target conformity; target homogeneity; ratio of the target volume and 50% isodose volume; normal tissue receiving doses >/=80%, >/=50%, and >/=20%; central nervous system volume irradiated to >/=20%; optical nerve volume irradiated >/=50%, D(max) of the lens; lens volume receiving >/=20%; and monitor units. RESULTS: PTVs ranged from 0.68 to 4.90 cm(3) (mean 1.97 +/- 0.97 cm(3)). The average reduction of the prescription isodose volume was 1-1.5 cm(3) for conformal (range 2.6-0.3 cm(3)), dynamic arc (range 2.5-0.3 cm(3)), and IMRT plans (range 3.9-0.1 cm(3)), compared with conventional arc therapy. Central nervous system volumes irradiated to doses >/=20% were smallest for conventional or dynamic arc treatments. Average target dose homogeneity values were 1.74 +/- 0.50 for arc, 1.27 +/- 0.02 for static mMLC, 1.26 +/- 0.01 for dynamic arc, and 1.15 +/- 0.03 for IMRT plans. IMRT helped to reduce doses to the lens but did not provide an advantage for optical nerve sparing. When applying IMRT, the monitor units increased by approximately one-third compared with static mMLC-based SRT. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal mMLC and dynamic arc SRT are the treatment options of choice for Linac-based SRT of uveal melanoma. They present dosimetric advantages, while being highly efficient in treatment planning and delivery

1	595	Peripheral doses from pediatric IMRT	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	Peripheral dose (PD) data exist for conventional fields (> or = 10 cm) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery to standard adult-sized phantoms. Pediatric peripheral dose reports are limited to conventional therapy and are model based. Our goal was to ascertain whether data acquired from full phantom studies and/or pediatric models, with IMRT treatment times, could predict Organ at Risk (OAR) dose for pediatric IMRT. As monitor units (MUs) are greater for IMRT, it is expected IMRT PD will be higher; potentially compounded by decreased patient size (absorption). Baseline slab phantom peripheral dose measurements were conducted for very small field sizes (from 2 to 10 cm). Data were collected at distances ranging from 5 to 72 cm away from the field edges. Collimation was either with the collimating jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC) oriented either perpendicular or along the peripheral dose measurement plane. For the clinical tests, five patients with intracranial or base of skull lesions were chosen. IMRT and conventional three-dimensional (3D) plans for the same patient/target/dose (180 cGy), were optimized without limitation to the number of fields or wedge use. Six MV, 120-leaf MLC Varian axial beams were used. A phantom mimicking a 3-year-old was configured per Center for Disease Control data. Micro (0.125 cc) and cylindrical (0.6 cc) ionization chambers were appropriated for the thyroid, breast, ovaries, and testes. The PD was recorded by electrometers set to the 10(-10) scale. Each system set was uniquely calibrated. For the slab phantom studies, close peripheral points were found to have a higher dose for low energy and larger field size and when MLC was not deployed. For points more distant from the field edge, the PD was higher for high-energy beams. MLC orientation was found to be inconsequential for the small fields tested. The thyroid dose was lower for IMRT delivery than that predicted for conventional (ratio of IMRT/conventional ranged from 0.47-0.94) doses approximately [0.4-1.8 cGy]/[0.9-2.9 cGy]/fraction, respectively. Prior phantom reports are for fields 10 cm or greater, while pediatric central nervous system fields range from 4 to 7 cm, and effectively much smaller for IMRT (2-6 cm). Peripheral dose in close proximity (< 10 cm from the field edge) is dominated by internal scatter; therefore, field-size differences overwhelm phantom size affects and increased MU. Distant peripheral dose, dominated by head leakage, was higher than predicted, even when accounting for MUs (approximtely factor of 3) likely due to the pediatric phantom size. The ratio of the testes dose ranged from 3.3-5.3 for IMRT/conventional. PD to OAR for pediatric IMRT cannot be predicted from large-field full phantom studies. For regional OAR, doses are likely lower than predicted by existing "large field" data, while the distant PD is higher

Semen samples were provided by men with obstructive azoospermia and spermatogenic failure who had serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) values within the normal range and either more or less than normal. Four prominent constituents of seminal plasma were identified by 1H-MRS: GPC, choline, citrate and lactate. The peak area ratios of choline/citrate as well as choline/lactate were significantly different (P < 0.01) between groups with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia. When the serum FSH values were normal in men with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia, a significant difference was found in the GPC/choline ratio (P < 0.001). When the FSH values were normal, the GPC/choline ratio appeared to be a very important parameter able to differentiate not only between cases of spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia but also between different forms of spermatogenic failure. These results demonstrate the potential use of 1H-MRS on human seminal plasma in a new approach in the management of male infertility	
0	391	Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units	Dose Fractionation, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Supine Position	Interplay between organ (breathing) motion and leaf motion has been shown in the literature to have a small dosimetric impact for clinical conditions (over a 30 fraction treatment). However, previous studies did not consider the case of treatment beams made up of many few-monitor-unit (MU) segments, where the segment delivery time (1-2 s) is of the order of the breathing period (3-5 s). In this study we assess if breathing compromises the radiotherapy treatment with IMRT segments of low number of MUs. We assess (i) how delivered dose varies, from patient to patient, with the number of MU per segment, (ii) if this delivered dose is identical to the average dose calculated without motion over the path of the motion, and (iii) the impact of the daily variation of the delivered dose as a function of MU per segment. The organ motion was studied along two orthogonal directions, representing the left-right and cranial-caudal directions of organ movement for a patient setup in the supine position. Breathing motion was modeled as sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x), based on functions used in the literature to represent organ motion. Measurements were performed with an ionization chamber and films. For a systematic study of motion effects, a MATLAB simulation was written to model organ movement and dose delivery. In the case of a single beam made up of one single segment, the dose delivered to point in a moving target over 30 fractions can vary up to 20% and 10% for segments of 10 MU and 20 MU, respectively. This dose error occurs because the tumor spends most of the time near the edges of the radiation beam. In the case of a single beam made of multiple segments with low MU, we observed 2.4%, 3.3%, and 4.3% differences, respectively, for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion, between delivered dose and motion-averaged dose for points in the penumbra region of the beam and over 30 fractions. In approximately 5-10% of the cases, differences between the motion-averaged dose and the delivered 30-fraction dose could reach 6%, 8% and 10-12%, respectively for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion. To analyze a clinical IMRT beam, two patient plans were randomly selected. For one of the patients, the beams showed a likelihood of up to 25.6% that the delivered dose would deviate from the motion-averaged dose by more than 1%. For the second patient, there was a likelihood of up to 62.8% of delivering a dose that differs by more than 1% from the motion-averaged dose and a likelihood of up to approximately 30% for a 2% dose error. For the entire five-beam IMRT plan, statistical averaging over the beams reduces the overall dose error between the delivered dose and the motion-averaged dose. For both patients there was a likelihood of up to 7.0% and 33.9% that the dose error was greater than 1%, respectively. For one of the patients, there was a 12.6% likelihood of a 2% dose error. Daily intrafraction variation of the delivered dose of more than 10% is non-negligible and can potentially lead to biological effects. We observed [for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x)] that below 10-15 MU leads to large daily variations of the order of 15-35%. Therefore, for small MU segments, non-negligible biological effects can be incurred. We conclude that for most clinical cases the effects may be small because of the use of many beams, it is desirable to avoid low-MU segments when treating moving targets. In addition, dose averaging may not work well for hypo-fractionation, where fewer fractions are used. For hypo-fractionation, PDF modeling of the tumor motion in IMRT optimization may not be adequate

The choice is depending on the technical equipment which is available and the clinical situation. The CT simulation of a non-monoisocentric technique was evaluated in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: The field match parameters were adjusted virtually at CT simulation and were compared with parameters derived mathematically. The coordinate transfer from the CT simulator to the conventional simulator was analyzed in 25 consecutive patients. RESULTS: The angles adjusted virtually for a geometrically exact coplanar field match corresponded with the angles calculated for each set-up. The mean isocenter displacement was 5.7 mm and the total uncertainty of the coordinate transfer was 6.7 mm (1 SD). Limitations in the patient set-up became obvious because of the steep arm abduction necessary to fit the 70 cm CT gantry aperture. Required modifications of the arm position and coordinate transfer errors led to a significant shift of the marked matchline of > 1.0 cm in eight of 25 patients (32%). CONCLUSION: The virtual CT simulation allows a precise and graphic definition of the field match parameters. However, modifications of the virtual set-up basically due to technical limitations were required in a total of 32% of cases, so that a hybrid technique was adapted at present that combines virtual adjustment of the ideal field alignment parameters with conventional simulation

This report details our experience with proton treatment of these tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-seven patients with pituitary adenomas treated with protons, who had at least 6 months of follow-up, were included in this analysis. Forty-two patients underwent a prior surgical resection; 5 were treated with primary radiation. Approximately half the tumors were functional. The median dose was 54 cobalt-gray equivalent. RESULTS: Tumor stabilization occurred in all 41 patients available for follow-up imaging; 10 patients had no residual tumor, and 3 had greater than 50% reduction in tumor size. Seventeen patients with functional adenomas had normalized or decreased hormone levels; progression occurred in 3 patients. Six patients have died; 2 deaths were attributed to functional progression. Complications included temporal lobe necrosis in 1 patient, new significant visual deficits in 3 patients, and incident hypopituitarism in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: Fractionated conformal proton-beam irradiation achieved effective radiologic, endocrinological, and symptomatic control of pituitary adenomas. Significant morbidity was uncommon, with the exception of postradiation hypopituitarism, which we attribute in part to concomitant risk factors for hypopituitarism present in our patient population

This article summarizes the current status of preclinical and clinical research on 223RaCl2. Potential advantages of 223Ra to that of external beam irradiation and registered beta-emitting bone seekers are discussed. Published data of 223Ra dosimetry in mice and a therapeutic study in a skeletal metastases model in nude rats have indicated significant therapeutic potential of bone-seeking alpha-emitters. This article provides short-term and long-term results from the first clinical single dosage trial. We also present data from a repeated dosage study of five consecutive injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight, once every 3rd week, or two injections of 125 kBq/kg body weight, 6 weeks apart. Furthermore, interim results are described for a randomized phase 2 trial involving 64 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and painful skeletal metastases who received four monthly injections of 223Ra or saline as an adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy. Lastly, we present preliminary dose estimates for 223Ra in humans. Results indicate that repeated dosing is feasible and toxicity is low, and that opportunities are available for combined treatment strategies. [References: 57]

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma

[Russian]	Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Aged, Cushing Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Pituitary Irradiation, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The application of protons (heavy charged particles) for irradiation of the pituitary body has some essential advantages over other types of teletherapy: insignificant destruction of surrounding tissues, a possibility of a single therapeutic session as well as the absence of post-radiation effects. Proton beam therapy was given to 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease aged 15 to 40. Mild cases were treated by proton beam irradiation only while severe cases were managed using proton beam therapy combined with unilateral adrenalectomy or oral administration of ortho-para-DDD. Catamnesis duration varied from 3 to 5 years. In most cases the exposure dose was 80-90 Gy (50-110 Gy). The procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. A dynamic multipolar converting method with 15-20 entrance poles in the left temporal area was employed (with the beam energy of 200 MeV). Stabilization of the course of disease and some clinical improvement were observed in most of the patients 3-4 months after proton beam therapy. In 6-36 months after irradiation 90% of the patients showed normal biochemical indices and the absence of any clinical signs of the disease. Three-five years after treatment, 94% of the patients were in steady remission. A 24-hour ACTH and cortisol normalization pattern was observed in all the patients in parallel with an increase in GH and gonadotropin secretion and a decrease in the prolactin level. Sex function renewal appeared to be the first clinical sign of remission. Young patients aged 15 to 20 with a short duration of disease reached remission faster than patients of the other age groups. Thus the results of proton beam therapy of 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease after a follow-up of 3-5 years showed a high efficacy of this type of treatment. The method can be used alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy as well as with oral administration of ortho-para-DDD

We studied these changes in the temporal lobe in six patients, following radiosurgery on the amygdala and hippocampus. (1)H MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T with short and long echo times (TE=10 and 135 ms) were used together with standard MR imaging sequences (T1-, T2-weighted). The treatment was performed by Leksell Gamma Knife with a dose of 50 Gy to the center and a 50% isodose to the margin of the target, represented by the mean volume of approximately 7.5 ml. Magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy examinations were performed at least once per year for 3 years. The most significant changes in spectra were observed approximately 1 year after the irradiation when edema in irradiated area was observed and strong signal of lipids was identified. Later, edema and lipid signals disappeared and follow-up was characterized by a decrease of NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations in the ipsilateral region of the brain to the irradiation (LCModel calculation from voxel of interest 3.8-4.5 ml positioned into the centrum of target volume). The concentration of NAA, Cr, and Cho after radiosurgery was significantly different from control values ( p<0.05) and also from concentrations in the contralateral part of the brain ( p<0.05). In the contralateral part, the concentration of NAA was significantly increased ( p<0.05) (NAA: before treatment 8.81, after treatment 11.33 mM). No radiotoxic changes were observed in the contralateral part of the brain or behind the area of target volume.

Pre-treatment samples were exposed in vitro to X-rays, individual dose-response curves for the induction of chromosomal aberrations were determined, and used as calibration curves to calculate the effective whole-body dose absorbed during the treatment. This calculated dose, based on the calibration curve relative to the induction of reciprocal exchanges, has a sharp increase after the first few fractions of the treatment, then saturates at high doses. Although carbon ions are 2-3 times more effective than X-rays in tumor sterilization, the effective dose was similar to that of X-ray treatment. However, the frequency of complex-type chromosomal exchanges was much higher for patients treated with carbon ions than X-ray

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were treated with proton beam radiation between September 1991 and December 1992. They had an initial examination including visual acuity, funduscopy, A and B scan ultrasonography of the eye, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. General examination included chest radiography and B scan ultrasonography of the liver. All tumors received a total dose of 60 cobalt-Gray equivalents (applied in four daily fractions) at the Orsay proton therapy center. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were treated with a median follow-up of 116 months. Their median age was 59 years. Thirteen tumors were anterior to the equator, 76 overlapped the equator and 78 were posterior to the equator. An initial retinal detachment was present in 41 cases. The optic disk was invaded in 10 cases. The median tumor diameter was 12 mm and the median tumor thickness was 5.8 mm. The mean initial acuity was 20/50. The survival rate was 62.93% at 10 years; 72.9% of deaths resulted from metastasis. Statistically significant risk factors for death identified in the multivariate analysis were tumor diameter greater than 12 mm (p=0.0004) and age over 60 years (p=0.0001). The metastasis rate at 10 years was 31%. The liver was affected in 97.8% of these patients. Risk factors for metastasis were the anterior site of the tumor, its volume greater than 0.4 cc and the presence of retinal detachment at diagnosis. The secondary enucleation rate at 10 years was 13.23%, mainly attributable to secondary neovascular glaucoma. The local recurrence rate was 6%. The visual acuity rate in 42.1% of patients was better than 20/100 at 10 years. Visual loss was mainly due to postradiation maculopathy and neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the long-term results found in the literature on proton beam radiation. This therapy allows good tumor control, an excellent eye retention rate, and good final visual acuity for approximately half of the patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, 175 patients received C-ion RT using a recommended dose fractionation (66.0 GyE/20 fractions) established from prior studies. C-ion RT alone was performed for 33 patients constituting a low-risk group (Stage < or =T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml and Gleason score < or =6); the remaining 142 high-risk patients received an additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and bNED rates were 91% and 87%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all but one patient. The 4-year bNED rates were 87% in the low-risk group and 88% in the high-risk group. In very advanced diseases (Stage > or= T3a or PSA > or= 20 ng/ml or Gleason score > or =8), there was significant difference in the bNED rate according to period of ADT administration (ADT > or =24 months: 93%, ADT <24 months: 73%, p<0.01). Grade 2 late toxicities developed in 4 patients (2%) for the rectum and 9 patients (5%) for the genitourinary system but no Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of C-ion RT for prostate cancer has been well confirmed.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients having adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands were treated with fast neutron radiotherapy during the years 1985-1994. All patients had either unresectable disease or gross disease remaining after attempted surgical extirpation. Seventeen patients had previously received conventional radiotherapy and their subsequent treatment fields and doses for neutron radiotherapy were modified for critical sites (brainstem, spinal cord, brain). Although the median doses (tumor maximum and tumor minimum) only varied by < or = 10%, treatment portals were substantially smaller in these patients because of normal tissue complication considerations. Twelve patients (13%) had distant metastases at the time of treatment and were only treated palliatively with smaller treatment portals and lower median tumor doses (< or = 80% of the doses delivered to curatively treated patients). Seventy-two patients were treated with curative intent, with nine of these having recurrent tumors after prior full-dose radiotherapy. The median duration of follow-up at the time of analysis was 31.5 months (range 3-115). Sites of disease and number of patients treated per disease site were as follows: paranasal sinus-31; oral cavity-20; oropharynx-12; nasopharynx-11; trachea-6; and other sites in the head and neck-4. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial local-regional tumor control rate for all patients treated with curative intent was 47%. Patients without involvement of the cavernous sinus, base of skull, or nasopharynx (51 patients) had a 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate of 59%, whereas local-regional control was significantly lower (15%) for patients with tumors involving these sites (p < 0.005). In the latter cases, normal tissue injury considerations precluded delivery of the full dose to the entire tumor. Patients with no history of prior radiotherapy (63 patients) had an actuarial local control rate of 57% at 5 years compared to 18% for those (9 patients) who had been previously irradiated with conventional photons (p = 0.018). Eliminating the dose-limiting factors of prior radiation therapy and/or high risk sites of involvement, the 5-year actuarial local-regional control rate for these 46 patients was 63%, with an actuarial cause specific survival rate of 79%. Lymph node status was a predictor of distant metastasis: 57% of node positive patients developed distant metastases by 5 years compared to 15% of patients with negative nodes (p < 0.0005), and patients who had nodal involvement developed distant metastases sooner than node negative patients (p < 0.0001). The 5-year actuarial overall survival and cause specific survival for the 72 patients treated with curative intent were 59% and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fast neutron radiotherapy offers high local-regional control and survival rates for patients with locally advanced, unresectable adenoid cystic carcinomas of minor salivary glands. It should be considered as initial primary treatment for these patients, as well as for other patients in whom surgical extirpation would cause considerable morbidity

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients having adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands were treated with fast neutron radiotherapy during the years 1985-1994. All patients had either unresectable disease or gross disease remaining after attempted surgical extirpation. Seventeen patients had previously received conventional radiotherapy and their subsequent treatment fields and doses for neutron radiotherapy were modified for critical sites (brainstem, spinal cord, brain). Although the median doses (tumor maximum and tumor minimum) only varied by < or = 10%, treatment portals were substantially smaller in these patients because of normal tissue complication considerations.

A modified linear accelerator was used in a moving field technique with multiple pendulum planes to apply single doses between 8 and 28 Gy by means of stereotaxis into the angiographically determined target volume. The medium follow-up is 23 months. The latency of radiogenic effects is between one and two years. Radiological controls with an interval of more than 18 months after therapy are available in 17 out of 41 patients. Angiographic investigation showed complete obliterations of pathological vessels in six out of these patients and partial obliterations in six patients; five patients remained unchanged. There were no acute complications. Seven patients presented neurological deficiencies with a latency of 6 to 12 months, however, in all cases but one they regressed completely. Even taking into consideration the small number of patients and the short time of observation, a comparison with the results of other radiotherapeutical proceedings allows to draw the conclusion that the presented technique of stereotaxic convergent-beam irradiation represents a relatively simple, reliable and, in case of precise indication, efficient method for the therapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations

Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects

CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects

Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%.

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

The study was designed to reveal the impact of pRT on normal brain tissue metabolism, which may potentially help in delineating the target volumes for reirradiated patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Spectra of 43 patients ages 16-63 years treated with pRT for primary glial tumors in the Center of Oncology Maria Curie Memorial Institute Branch in Gliwice were analyzed. The control group consisted of spectra acquired for 30 healthy volunteers. All patients were treated with 3D conformal techniques using 6-20 MV photons to total doses of 60 Gy. Spectra were acquired from the control region before pRT and from three uninvolved regions 9-12 months after the end of pRT. Voxels were located in the region of low (<6 Gy), medium (29-39 Gy), and high radiation dose ( approximately 60 Gy). Relative intensities of the signals relating to N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), choline-based compounds, creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), mio-Inositol, lactate, and lipids were obtained. RESULTS: The spectra of "normal brain" taken 9 months after pRT are significantly different from those obtained for control volunteers and from the spectra acquired before radiotherapy. The lactate and lipids signals are very strong; however, they are not correlated with absorbed dose. NAA/Cr ratios are significantly lower than before radiotherapy even for the low-dose regions. Differences increase with radiation dose: the NAA/Cr ratio is significantly lower for the regions of brain receiving a high dose of radiation than for the low-dose areas. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of primary brain tumors (surgery + postoperative radiotherapy) causes alteration of brain metabolism, even in regions of the brain far from the postoperative tumor bed and receiving relatively low total doses of radiation. Single voxel MRS spectroscopy in vivo cannot help in delineating target volumes for secondary irradiation

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1984 to 31st December 1998, 739 female patients were operated in our institution, diagnosed as having infiltrating breast cancer. One hundred and eighty-eight patients (25.43%) received conservative treatment and they were followed up until December 2003. RESULTS: Average age when diagnosed was 50.42 years old (24-87 years). 53.19% of the patients were premenopausal. After a median follow-up of 129 months (60-198 months), 13 women (6.91%) presented local -regional recurrence and the disease-free time was 48.4 months (8-108 months). Global survival rate was 83.5% and disease free survival rate was 80.85%. CONCLUSIONS: The management of choice for early stage (I and II) infiltrating breast cancer is nowadays conservative, with a low local-regional recurrence rate and survival rate that are comparable to radical mastectomy, according to the literature. It's a safe and efficient method that let us preserve the breast with a good esthetical result. In selected cases, when a regional recurrence occurs, a second conservative management is possible with a good control of the disease, although the most widely accepted treatment in these cases is total mastectomy

The use of betatrons after a growth between 1960-1970 decreased progressively from 1975 in favour of linear accelerators (133 in 1989). Cobalt-therapy, rapidly grown up between 1960 and 1980, has reached a plateau phase with a trend to being progressively substituted by low energy linac. The dosimetric aspects are considered: calibration of electron beams, quality control and treatment planning. About 22000 cancer patients were treated in 16 Centres in 1983; of these only 23% (mean value) received electron therapy, but the number varies greatly from one center to another (9-45%). The major indications for electrons in France are: neck nodes, operated breast, internal mammary chain. The general trend is to restrict their use to lesions not deeper than 4-5 cm and first of all to employ them as a boosting treatment, after an X ray irradiation

To assess the possibility that risks from radionuclide exposures may be underestimated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Risk estimates following internal exposures can be made for a small number of alpha-particle-emitting nuclides. (1) Lung cancer in underground miners exposed by inhalation to radon-222 gas and its short-lived progeny. Studies of residential (222)Rn exposure are generally consistent with predictions from the miner studies. (2) Liver cancer and leukaemia in patients given intravascular injections of Thorotrast, a thorium-232 oxide preparation that concentrates in liver, spleen and bone marrow. (3) Bone cancer in patients given injections of radium-224, and in workers exposed occupationally to (226)Ra and (228)Ra, mainly by ingestion. (4) Lung cancer in Mayak workers exposed to plutonium-239, mainly by inhalation. Liver and bone cancers were also seen, but the dosimetry is not yet sufficiently good enough to provide quantitative estimates of risks. Comparisons can be made between risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer derived for radionuclide exposure and those derived for the A-bomb survivors, exposed mainly to low-LET (linear energy transfer) external radiation. Data from animal studies, using dogs and rodents, allow comparisons of cancer induction by a range of alpha- and beta-/gamma-emitting radionuclides. They provide information on relative biological effectiveness (RBE), dose-response relationships, dose-rate effects and the location of target cells for different malignancies. RESULTS: For lung and liver cancer, the estimated values of risk per Sv for internal exposure, assuming an RBE for alpha-particles of 20, are reasonably consistent with estimates for external exposure to low-LET radiation. This also applies to bone cancer when risk is calculated on the basis of average bone dose, but consideration of dose to target cells on bone surfaces suggests a low RBE for alpha-particles. Similarly, for leukaemia, the comparison of risks from alpha-irradiation ((232)Th and progeny) and external radiation suggest a low alpha RBE; this conclusion is supported by animal data. Risk estimates for internal exposure are dependent on the assumptions made in calculating dose. Account is taken of the distribution of radionuclides within tissues and the distribution of target cells for cancer induction. For the lungs and liver, the available human and animal data provide support for current assumptions. However, for bone cancer and leukaemia, it may be that changes are required. Bone cancer risk may be best assessed by calculating dose to a 50 micro m layer of marrow adjacent to endosteal (inner) bone surfaces rather than to a single 10 micro m cell layer as currently assumed. Target cells for leukaemia may be concentrated towards the centre of marrow cavities so that the risk of leukaemia from bone-seeking radionuclides, particularly alpha emitters, may be overestimated by the current assumption of uniform distribution of target cells throughout red bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime risk estimates considered here for exposure to internally deposited radionuclides and to external radiation are subject to uncertainties, arising from the dosimetric assumptions made, from the quality of cancer incidence and mortality data and from aspects of risk modelling; including variations in baseline rates between populations for some cancer types. Bearing in mind such uncertainties, comparisons of risk estimates for internal emitters and external radiation show good agreement for lung and liver cancers. For leukaemia, the available data suggest that the assumption of an alpha-particle RBE of 20 can result in overestimates of risk. For bone cancer, it also appears that current assumptions will overestimate risks from alpha-particle-emitting nuclides, particularly at low doses. [References: 94]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service

A five-field 18 MV photon treatment plan, selected to minimize lung dose, is compared with helium ions using the same field configuration. Dose volume histograms show target coverage, as well as dose delivered to critical structures lung, heart, mediastinum, and spinal cord. Although both helium ions and photons deliver approximately the same lung dose for this treatment plan, radiation to the heart and spinal cord from this field arrangement is significantly reduced with the helium ion beam. The concentration of dose at the tumor site, while sparing surrounding normal tissue, is characteristic of charged particle therapy, particularly with light ions, which includes particles with Z from that of protons (Z = 1) through that of neon (Z = 10)

In order to minimise the workload related to the quality assurance of the IMRT fields, we have explored the possibility of using a commercially available aSi portal imager for absolute dosimetric verification of the delivery of dynamic IMRT fields. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the basic dosimetric characteristics of an aSi portal imager (aS500, Varian Medical Systems), using an acquisition mode especially developed for portal dose (PD) integration during delivery of a-static or dynamic-radiation field. Secondly, the dose calculation algorithm of a commercially available treatment planning system (Cadplan, Varian Medical Systems) was modified to allow prediction of the PD image, i.e. to compare the intended fluence distribution with the fluence distribution as actually delivered by the dynamic multileaf collimator. Absolute rather than relative dose prediction was applied. The PD image prediction was compared to the corresponding acquisition for several clinical IMRT fields by means of the gamma evaluation method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The acquisition mode is accurate in integrating all PD over a wide range of monitor units, provided detector saturation is avoided. Although the dose deposition behaviour in the portal image detector is not equivalent to the dose to water measurements, it is reproducible and self-consistent, lending itself to quality assurance measurements. Gamma evaluations of the predicted versus measured PD distribution were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria for all clinical IMRT fields, i.e. allowing a dose difference of 3% of the local field dose in combination with a distance to agreement of 3 mm

METHODS: Forty patients with a total of 47 metastatic brain tumors were evaluated. The primary lesion was identified in all cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery was effective in 37 lesions. All patients were examined using Gd-enhanced MR imaging before and after SRS. Thalium-201 chloride was administered to 27 patients with 34 tumors and SPECT images were obtained. Proton MR spectroscopy was performed in 36 patients who harbored 43 tumors. On Gd-enhanced MR images, a decrease in the volume of the Gd-enhanced lesion and a change in the enhanced effect in the lesion after treatment were recognized as showing the effectiveness of SRS between 1 and 3 months or more (mean 8.54 +/- 3.58 weeks). In 201TlCl-SPECT studies, the ratio of lesion to normal brain decreased from 2 weeks to 2 months (mean 5.03 +/- 2.77 weeks) after radiosurgery. On 1H-MR spectroscopy images a high choline (Cho) peak and a lipid-dominant (Lip) peak were observed in 25 lesions and a high Cho peak and a lactate-dominant (Lac) peak were observed in 12 lesions before SRS. A decrease in the Cho peak, a disappearance of the Lac peak, and an increase in the Lip peak were observed between 1 week and 1 month (mean 2.76 +/- 1.62 weeks) after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on histopathological findings obtained at autopsy or at surgery, we assume that a high Cho peak may be observed in viable tumor tissue and a Lip peak in areas of necrosis. The results indicate that 1H-MR spectroscopy is potentially a more sensitive tool in evaluating the response to SRS than 201TlCl-SPECT or Gd-enhanced MR imaging and that it can be used earlier for this purpose than those other imaging methods

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Models of dynamic changes in cell number with time were used to develop a function for the remission time (T(rem)) after palliative radiotherapy: [See Equation], where BED is the biologically effective dose, t(1) the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of radiotherapy), K the daily BED repopulation equivalent, alpha the linear radiosensitivity parameter in the linear-quadratic model, and z the tumor regression rate. RESULTS: Simulations of clinical trials show marked variations in remission statistics depending on the tumor characteristics and are highly compatible with the results of clinical trials. Dose escalation produces both a higher proportion and extended duration of remissions, especially in tumors with high alpha/beta ratios and K values, but the predicted dose responses of acute and late side effects show that caution is necessary. The prospect of using particle beam therapy to reduce normal tissue radiation exposures or using hypoxic sensitizers to improve the tumor cell kill might significantly improve the results of palliative radiotherapy in carefully selected patients and could also be used for safer palliative re-treatments in patients with the potential for prolonged survival. The effect of tumor heterogeneity in determining palliative responses probably exceeds that in radical radiotherapy; as few as 100 patients in each treatment arm produce statistically unreliable results. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual trials of palliative radiotherapy can be useful to test the effects of competing schedules and better determine future strategies, including improved design of clinical trials as well as combinations of radiotherapy with other anticancer modalities

These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039).

On the basis on the results, a phase II study using a regimen of four fractions during 1 week was performed. The purpose of the present study was to determine the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2003, 79 patients with 80 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA NSCLC and 60.0 GyE for stage IB NSCLC in four fractions during 1 week, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.8 years. Sixty-two (78.5%) of these patients were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The data were statistically processed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years or until death, with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months, ranging from 2.5 to 72.2 months. The local control rate for all patients was 90% (T1: 98%, T2: 80%). The patients' 5-year lung cancer-specific survival rate was 68% (IA: 87%, IB: 42%). The overall survival was 45% (IA: 62%, IB: 25%). Half of the deaths were attributable to intercurrent diseases. No toxic reactions in the lung greater than grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion beam radiotherapy with a regimen of four fractions during 1 week has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated in Uppsala during 1991-97 were included (men = 14, women = 12; mean age = 39, range = 23-64). The nidus volumes ranged from 0.3 to 102 ml (mean = 24, median = 13). The follow-up included clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (and/or computed tomography) every 6-12 months for 3 years and final angiography. RESULTS: The volume changes at final follow-up in AVMs >25 ml were -89, -85, -44, -29, -7, 0, 0, +5 and +18 (%); in AVMs 11-24 ml, -100, -100, -97, -92 and 0 (%); and in AVMs <10 ml, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, -99, -98, -50, -0 and +40 (%). Two patients were lost to follow-up due to cerebral haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. Radiology displayed significant perifocal oedema in one patient and slight oedema in four patients. Of nine patients with epilepsy, seven became seizure-free after therapy while two continued to suffer from seizures. CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation is successful in a relatively high proportion of intermediate and large-sized cerebral AVMs. The adverse effects are acceptable. The advantage of proton treatment compared with gamma knife and LINAC stereotactic irradiation is that protons can irradiate even large volumes with a very sharp dose profile against normal surroundings. Thus, proton beam irradiation is a valuable option in the treatment of AVMs larger than 10 ml

A combined CP/CPMG multi-echo, multislice sequence was used to measure T1 and T2 in each pixel with an uncertainty not exceeding 10%. In a prospective clinical study, 12 patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors were investigated. For each ROI in the calculated T1 and T2 parameter images, texture parameters originating from the grey level distribution, the gradient distribution, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the grey level runlength histogram were used for classification and discrimination between tissues. All regions corresponding to the normal brain tissue (white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid) were successfully discriminated from each other as well as from the pathological tissue parts (edema and tumor). The classification of 10 edematous and 8 tumorous tissue regions yielded only one misclassification. Together with additional rules, these discrimination rules formed the knowledge base of an expert system for segmentation of the brain images. In cases of tumors without Gd-DTPA contrast medium uptake or in cases of Gd-DTPA contraindication, segmentated images can help solve nontrivial diagnostical problems such as delineating the target volume in radiation therapy

For each ROI in the calculated T1 and T2 parameter images, texture parameters originating from the grey level distribution, the gradient distribution, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the grey level runlength histogram were used for classification and discrimination between tissues. All regions corresponding to the normal brain tissue (white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid) were successfully discriminated from each other as well as from the pathological tissue parts (edema and tumor). The classification of 10 edematous and 8 tumorous tissue regions yielded only one misclassification. Together with additional rules, these discrimination rules formed the knowledge base of an expert system for segmentation of the brain images. In cases of tumors without Gd-DTPA contrast medium uptake or in cases of Gd-DTPA contraindication, segmentated images can help solve nontrivial diagnostical problems such as delineating the target volume in radiation therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A targeting system that integrates a CT-on-rails scanner with a linear accelerator (LINAC) was evaluated in the lead-in portion of a Phase I/II protocol for treating patients with paraspinal metastases. Patients were immobilized in supine position by a moldable body cushion vacuum wrapped with a plastic fixation sheet. Planning CT and immediately repeated CT were performed on the LINAC/CT-on-rails unit to assess respiratory-related vertebral body motion. Coplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using 7-9 beams was used to deliver 30 Gy in five fractions to the target volume, while limiting the spinal cord dose to <10 Gy. Pretreatment CT scans were fused with the planning CT scans to determine the correct target isocenter by accounting for any translational and roll (axial) rotational discrepancies from the planning CT. (Corrections caused by yaw and pitch rotations have not yet been implemented.) The reproducibility of the treatment isocenter as compared with the planned isocenter was measured with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), portal film imaging, and immediate post-treatment verification CT scans. Phantom measurements were taken for dose verification for each IMRT plan. RESULTS: Based on a total of 36 CT scans (3 for planning, 3 for respiration study, 15 pretreatment, and 15 post-treatment) from 3 patients, no respiration-associated vertebral body motion was seen. A comparison of the corrected daily anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) digital portal images with the planning AP and LAT DRRs confirmed that the isocenter setup accuracy for the 15 treatments was within 1 mm of the planning isocenter. The results from the immediate post-treatment CT scans reconfirmed the findings from the portal images and verified the absence of spinal movement during the treatment. The ion-chamber measurement for the high-dose region was within 2% of the planning dose for three patient treatment plans. Film dose measurement in an IMRT quality assurance phantom demonstrated good agreement from 90% to 30% isodose lines between the planned and measured results. CONCLUSION: Preliminary experience suggests that the near-simultaneous CT image-guided verification technique can be used as a new platform technology for extracranial applications of stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery to spinal and paraspinal tumors

Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHODS: MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a "spreading wavefront" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients (48 lesions) and nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were applied in the carbon dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 gray equivalents (GyE) by a 10% increment and from 68.4 to 79.2GyE by a 5% increment, respectively. The radiation target consisted of primary tumor. Image analysis of the patients with local recurrence was systematically performed after the treatment by focusing attention on the enhanced thin slice CT images of the primary lesion. By superimposing the dose distribution on the planning CT image and marking the anatomically identified loci of recurrence, it was possible to establish the relationship between the dose distribution and the incipient loci of recurrence and to classify the recurrence patterns from the differences in the recurrence loci. RESULTS: Local recurrence was found in 19 (23.2%) out of a total of 82 lesions. It is possible to distinguish between three recurrence patterns: Pattern 1 representing marginal recurrence and patterns 2a and 2b, which are both instances of in-field recurrence. In pattern 1, four recurrences take place from a region on the upper tumor margin. In pattern 2a, 13 recurrences take place from the center of the tumor. In pattern 2b, two recurrences take place from the near-center of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: For the 15 in-field recurrence lesions (patterns 2a and 2b) after excluding the four marginal recurrence lesions (patterns 1), we have established that the local control shows dose-dependence. Based on this, we have determined the optimal therapeutic dose

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) system was developed to identify the 3D position of a 2-mm gold marker implanted in the prostate 30 times/s using two sets of fluoroscopic images. The linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the gold marker was located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. Ten patients with prostate cancer treated with RTRT were the subjects of this study. The coordinates of the gold marker were recorded every 0.033 s during RTRT in the supine treatment position for 2 min. The patient was then moved to the prone position, and the marker was tracked for 2 min to acquire data regarding movement in this position. Measurements were taken 5 times for each patient (once a week); a total of 50 sets for the 10 patients was analyzed. The raw data from the RTRT system were filtered to reduce system noise, and the amplitude of movement was then calculated. The discrete Fourier transform of the unfiltered data was performed for the frequency analysis of prostate movement. RESULTS: No apparent difference in movement was found among individuals. The amplitude of 3D movement was 0.1-2.7 mm in the supine and 0.4-24 mm in the prone positions. The amplitude in the supine position was statistically smaller in all directions than that in the prone position (p < 0.0001). The amplitude in the craniocaudal and AP directions was larger than in the left-right direction in the prone position (p < 0.0001). No characteristic movement frequency was detected in the supine position. The respiratory frequency was detected for all patients regarding movement in the craniocaudal and AP directions in the prone position. The results of the frequency analysis suggest that prostate movement is affected by the respiratory cycle and is influenced by bowel movement in the prone position. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have confirmed that internal organ motion is less frequent in the supine position than in the prone position in the treatment of prostate cancer. RTRT would be useful in reducing uncertainty due to the effects of the respiratory cycle, especially in the prone position

Between June 1998 and July 2000, 27 patients were treated for benign lesions with radiosurgery using a 6-MV linear accelerator-based X-knife system and circular collimators. The lesions included schwannoma, meningioma, papillary cyst adenoma, and hemangioblastoma. Five patients had tissue diagnosis. The mean peripheral dose to the tumor margin was 12.8 Gy. The mean dose to the isocenter was 16.3 Gy. One to five isocenters were used to treat these lesions, with a mean of 10 arcs per isocenter and mean collimator size of 1.25 cm. Follow-up information was available on all patients, with a mean follow-up duration of 33 months. Six patients (22%) had improved symptoms and 21 (78%) had stable symptoms. Eight patients (30%) had regression of tumor and 19 had stable disease (70%). No patient had tumor progression, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade III or IV toxicity did not occur in any patients. In 3 patients (11%), RTOG grade I or grade II neurotoxicity developed. Of these, one patient had worsening of a preexisting VIIth nerve deficit that required temporary oral methylprednisolone, and in two patients a mild trigeminal deficit developed that did not require any medical intervention. Low-dose homogeneous radiosurgery using a linear accelerator is an effective treatment for benign intracranial tumors. If lower, more homogeneous radiation doses produce responses as durable as higher doses, then toxicity might be further reduced

The cosmetic outcome was excellent in 107 patients (82%), acceptable in 17 patients (13%), and unacceptable in six patients (5%). Complete axillary dissection (CAD) was more morbid than limited axillary dissection (LAD) as a means of preradiotherapy staging of the axilla. The former was more often associated with breast edema, hematoma formation, and subsequent development of arm edema than the latter. A multivariate analysis revealed that the four most dominant variables associated with the attainment of an excellent cosmetic outcome were: 1) the performance of a conservative biopsy procedure; 2) small breast size (cup size A and B); 3) the use of electron energies equal to or less than 12 MeV; and 4) the presence of primary tumors less than or equal to 4 cm in diameter when adjusted for breast size. Postexternal beam supplementation to the area of the primary tumor was accomplished with electrons in 107 patients (82%) and with interstitial implantation in 23 patients (18%). Excellent cosmetic results were achieved in 97 of the 107 patients (91%) treated with electrons. The use of electrons appears to produce local control and cosmesis equal to that of interstitial implantation if specific indications and guidelines are followed, and is superior to implantation in certain clinical settings

Surgical excision is often attempted after embolization. Interventional neuro-radiology is available in only a few centers. If large AVMs can be safely excised without pre-operative embolizaton, then these lesions can be treated at many neurosurgical centers. METHODS: Between January 1986 and June 1992, a total of 210 patients with cerebral AVMs were diagnosed by angiographic studies. Twenty-seven of them had large AVMs wider than 5 cm in the longest diameter. The case records of these patients were retrieved and studied. RESULTS: Two patients were treated with Bragg peak proton beam therapy. Twelve patients were treated conservatively with no improvement. Thirteen patients underwent surgery and total AVM excision was achieved in 11. None of the patients who underwent surgery had any pre- or intra-operative embolization. All the patients had no neurological deterioration post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS: Large cerebral AVMs can be treated by surgical excision alone with acceptable results

Temozolomide has shown antineoplastic activity against malignant gliomas and more recently was beneficial in one patient with gliomatosis cerebri. To make an objective assessment of the effect of long-term temozolomide administration in a patient with gliomatosis cerebri we used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural MRI. A 46-year-old man with gliomatosis cerebri was treated with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 28 days). Twenty cycles of temozolomide resulted in a marked reduction in choline and scyllo-inositol content, as detected using brain proton MR spectroscopy, indicating reduced tumor cellularity and/or growth rate. Neurochemical improvements were associated with normalization of the signal intensity in most of the previously affected cerebral regions and regression of mass effect on MRI. A left pyramidal syndrome, present at the start of the treatment, disappeared. Our observation lends support to larger clinical trials evaluating the use of temozolomide to treat this brain tumor

1	277	Carbon ion therapy for ocular melanoma: planning orthogonal two-port treatment	Carbon, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Incidence, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Organ Specificity, Planning Techniques, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Software, Synchrotrons	We recently started orthogonal two-port carbon ion therapy for choroidal melanoma with the intent to reduce the incidence of radiation complications that occur with mono-port therapy. Treatment planning techniques involving therapeutic beam characteristics are described here. The vertical (140 MeV/u) and horizontal (170 MeV/u) carbon ion beams from the synchrotron at the NIRS were shaped, using the passive beam delivery system, to irradiate the target volume. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with a region of uniform HMV-I cell killing. The apertures and range compensators were designed for individual patients. A commercial treatment planning system, which was customized to our general carbon ion therapy, was tested for applicability to this treatment. Dose distributions were calculated with either a broad beam or a pencil beam algorithm using parameters determined by measurements and calculations. We evaluated the accuracy of the system software features, and replaced or added some other features to the software. The system was used for 12 patients during the past year. For nine patients two-port treatment was assessed to be more effective than mono-port therapy and these patients were treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams	
1	1430	Cognitive function in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: prospective long-term follow-up	Adult, Cognition/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/et [Etiology], Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Time Factors	PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term cognitive function of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data of 95 AVM patients were prospectively assessed up to 3 years after radiosurgery. Of these patients, 39 had a follow-up of at least 2 years. Radiosurgery was performed using a modified linear accelerator (minimal doses to the target volume 15-22 Gy, median dose 20). The neuropsychological evaluation included testing of intelligence, attention, and memory. The effect of a preexisting intracranial hemorrhage, as well as AVM occlusion, on cognitive functions was analyzed after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: No cognitive declines were observed during follow-up. Instead significant improvements occurred in intelligence (1 year, +6.1 IQ points; 2 years, +5.1 IQ points), memory (1 year, +18.3 percentile score; 2 years, +12.2 percentile score), and attention (1 year, +19 percentile score; 2 years, +18 percentile score). Patients without previous intracranial hemorrhage improved more than patients with intracranial hemorrhage, although this difference was not statistically significant. The role of AVM occlusion on cognitive function is not clear at present. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery does not induce measurable deterioration of cognitive function in patients with cerebral AVMs

Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas

1	721	Therapy strategies for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas using modern radiation therapy techniques	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Germany, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Orbital Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated whether modern photon techniques, such as stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy (FSRT) or intensity-modulated RT, outweighed the biologic advantages of high-linear-energy transfer RT in the treatment of patients with locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) that infiltrated the skull base or the orbit. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5% and 77.5% for Group A and 72.2% and 24.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5%/53% and 86.6%/75.8% for Group A and 69.2%/23% and 77.9%/77.9% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone

This boost dose was 20 Gy (Paris System) for submucosal lesions (seven patients) and 25 Gy for intramural (eight patients) and extramural (ten patients) lesions. With a mean follow-up of 40.5 months, there have been five local recurrences, the latest occurring 16 months post-tumorectomy. Two of these five patients are alive and disease-free 1 year post salvage abdominoperineal resection. The 20 patients with local control have preserved a full functional sphincter and 19 of them are disease-free; there were few complications. This sphincter preserving combined approach seems promising for patients with tumors of the middle and lower rectum who cannot undergo major surgery and for selected patients who refuse abdominoperineal resection

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 1998, 142 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with breast conservative surgery and adjuvant RT. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a boost dose of 15 Gy delivered to the tumor bed either by iridium 192, or a combination of photons and electrons. Cosmetic evaluations were done on a 6-month basis, with a final evaluation at 36 months after RT. The evaluations were done using a panel of global and specific subjective scores, a digitized scoring system using the breast retraction assessment (BRA) measurement, and a patient's self-assessment evaluation. As cosmetic results were graded according to severity, the comparison of boost techniques was done using the ordinal logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. RESULTS: At 36 months of follow-up, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the global subjective cosmetic outcome (OR = 1.40; 95%CI = 0.69-2.85, p = 0.35). Good to excellent scores were observed in 65% of implant patients and 62% of photon/electron patients. At 24 months and beyond, telangiectasia was more severe in the implant group with an OR of 9.64 (95%CI = 4.05-22.92, p < 0.0001) at 36 months. The only variable associated with a worse global cosmetic outcome was the presence of concomitant chemotherapy (OR = 3.87; 95%CI = 1.74-8.62). The BRA value once adjusted for age, concomitant chemotherapy, and boost volume showed a positive association with the boost technique. The BRA value was significantly greater in the implant group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the patient's final self-assessment score between the two groups. Three variables were statistically associated with an adverse self-evaluation: an inferior quadrant tumor localization, postoperative hematoma, and concomitant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial showed that at 36 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in the overall global cosmetic scores between the implant boost group and the photon/electron boost group, telangiectasia was more severe and the BRA value was greater in the implant group

In this high risk group of patients, total body irradiation (TBI) has been proposed as a systemic adjuvant. To aid in the design of a clinical TBI protocol, we have studied the in vitro radiation response of two established cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma and human bone marrow CFUc. The Ewing's lines showed a larger Do (1.26 Gy, 2.04 Gy) and n (6.0, 3.2) compared to the bone marrow CFUc (Do = 0.86 Gy, n = 1.2). No repair of potentially lethal radiation damage (PLDR) was found after 4.5 Gy in plateau phase Ewing's sarcoma cells. A theoretical split dose survival curve for both the Ewing's sarcoma lines and human bone marrow CFUc using this TBI schedule shows a significantly lower surviving fraction (10(-4)-10(-5] for the bone marrow CFUc. Based on these in vitro results, two 4.0 Gy fractions separated by 24 hours is proposed as the TBI regimen. Because of the potentially irreversible damage to bone marrow, autologous bone marrow transplantation following the TBI is felt to be necessary. The details of this clinical protocol in high risk Ewing's sarcoma patients are outlined

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality

Despite a 3D conformal RT technique and the omission of elective mediastinal fields, three (of ten) patients with inoperable stage 3 NSCLC who were treated with induction chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) followed by RT to 70 Gy, developed symptomatic radiation pneumonitis. In this planning study, the actual treatment plans of all ten patients were compared to plans derived using two beam intensity-modulated (BIM) techniques, for which similar geometrical beam setup parameters were used. In the first technique (BF-BIM), cranial and caudal boost fields were applied in order to allow field length reduction. The second technique (C-BIM) utilised 3-D missing-tissue compensators for all radiation beams. Both BIM techniques resulted in a significant sparing of critical normal tissues and the C-BIM technique was superior in all cases. When compared to the actual RT technique used for treatment, a reduction of 8.1+/-4.7% (1 S.D.) was observed in the mean lung dose for the BF-BIM plan, vs. 20.3+/-5.8% (1 S.D.) for the C-BIM plan. Similar reductions were observed in the percentage of the total lung volume exceeding 20 Gy (V(20)) for these techniques. BIM techniques appear to be a promising tool for enabling radiation dose-escalation and/or intensive concurrent chemo-RT in inoperable lung cancer

In this report, we present three patients with malignant liver tumors treated by proton beam therapy in whom pre- and post-therapeutic hepatic functional reserves were evaluated sequentially for more than a year by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. All three patients exhibited the distinctive time course of 99mTc-GSA uptake efficiency, which suggested a transient decline in the ratio of liver activity to heart and liver activity at 15 minutes (LHL15) 3-6 months after proton beam therapy. This change was not in parallel with that expected from a functioning normal liver tissue volume. In a year after proton beam therapy, LHL15 recovered nearly to the pre-treatment level in all three patients. Our observations may be related to the up-regulation of receptor-mediated 99mTc-GSA uptake during hepatic regeneration after proton beam therapy. [References: 27]

At present there are approximately 20 active protocols, some specifying radio-oncological study questions, in which about 500 to 600 children annually are given radiotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Pediatric Radiation Oncology Working Group (APRO) of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) represents the organizational link between GPOH and DEGRO. Their activities range from phrasing guidelines of radio-oncological therapy, through writing a protocol for a prospective study on radiation-induced late effects (RISK--in co-operation with GPOH, 695 patients registered so far) and organizing meetings for information transfer, to implementing radio-oncology within the prospective studies of the GPOH by establishing study chairs for radio-oncology when radio-oncological questions are a primary focus and/or to function as a reference institution for quality assurance. These activities also include individual case consultations outside the study proper. Twice annually the members of the APRO meet for an update on current knowledge and future directions where a representative of the GPOH is invited to contribute special aspects of pediatric oncology. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, modern technology (intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, inclusion of imaging in treatment planning) will be part of disease management in pediatric oncology. A working group for modern radiotherapy technology was established to enhance this development. Prospective studies of the GPOH with primary or secondary radio-oncological questions require the implementation of corresponding tasks (documentation, monitoring, etc.) in order to meet future demands on clinical trials and to achieve the aims of the protocol. Consequently adequate financial support is indispensable

Five patients had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and one required therapy for a carcinoma of the common bile duct. We sought to determine whether state-of-the-art PET technology could be used to monitor the three-dimensional activity distribution of radiation-induced radioactivity. At the time of the examination all six patients had sufficient concentrations of C-11 and N-13 activity in the irradiated volume to permit the evaluation of the activity distribution.

Characteristics of both techniques are described. With the Tubingen radiosurgery system a good adaptation of the dose distribution to spherical or oval target volumes with a steep dose gradient was achieved, whereas homogeneity and adaptation of the dose distribution to irregularly shaped targets were better with the Heidelberg conformation technique. The mechanical accuracy of the Tubingen floorstand system was 0.3 mm +/- 0.2 mm, and that of the Heidelberg mask fixation system < 1 mm. Both methods require similar total treatment times. Nine patients were treated by the Tubingen radiosurgery system. The results are compared with 12 patients treated by conformation radiotherapy in Heidelberg. In both patient groups no further tumour growth occurred. Four of 9 single dose treated patients developed side-effects, such as temporary trigeminal and facial paraesthesia hearing deterioration and oedema. In contrast, patients treated by fractionated radiotherapy showed no side-effects. Relating to the short follow-up the results indicate that single dose application has certain drawbacks for special indications. Further studies have to work out which method gives the best treatment results

The greatest challenge of this project is to realize treatment of a moving target by scanning irradiation. For this purpose, we decided to combine the rescanning technique and the gated irradiation method. To determine how to avoid hot and/or cold spots by the relatively large number of rescannings within an acceptable irradiation time, we have studied the scanning strategy, scanning magnets and their control, and beam intensity dynamic control. We have designed a raster scanning system and carried out a simulation of irradiating moving targets. The result shows the possibility of practical realization of moving target irradiation with pencil beam scanning. We describe the present status of our design study of the raster scanning system for the HIMAC new treatment facility

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four A-T (ARO, BMA, CSA and RJO) and two control (JAC and KKB3) LCL were exposed to doses of up to 4Gy of accelerated nitrogen ions (32-45 MeV/u, 8-12Gy/min). For comparative purposes X-ray irradiation (1.36 Gy/min) was also performed. The induction of apoptosis was studied 0-48 h after irradiation with the use of two methods: (1) monitoring of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA fragments by field inversion pulse gel electrophoresis (FIGE); and (2) morphological characterization ofapoptotic cells after fluorescent staining. In parallel, cell-cycle distribution, monitored by DNA flow cytometry, as well as measurements of p53/p21(WAF1) protein levels by Western blots, were investigated in these cells. RESULTS: High-LET radiation-induced apoptosis and G2/M-arrest in both A-T and control LCL. No significant increase in the amount of p53/p21(WAF1) proteins preceded apoptosis in control or in A-T LCL after high-LET irradiation. However, low-LET radiation did induce significant enhanced levels of p53 proteins in control but not in A-T LCL. CONCLUSIONS: LCL from both A-T homozygous and unaffected healthy individuals undergo apoptosis without accumulation of p53/p21(WAF1) proteins after exposure to high-LET radiation. In contrast, low-LET radiation induces apoptosis and significantly increases levels of p53 protein in control but not in A-T LCL

However, the preferred assessment following radiation therapy is local control. PROCEDURE: A review of large group experiences over the past several decades was undertaken to assess the optimal radiation dose and volume for patients with localized, osseous Ewing sarcoma. New approaches and techniques to improve local control were also investigated. RESULTS: With multidisciplinary therapy, 5-year overall local control rates range from 58 to 93%. Following definitive irradiation, they are 53-86%. Recommended radiation therapy doses are 55.8-60.0 Gy. In the postoperative setting, gross disease requires 55.8 Gy; microscopic disease requires 45 Gy. Altered fractionation schemes have not improved local control. The appropriate irradiated volume is an involved field to the pretreatment tumor volume plus 2.0-2.5 cm margin, followed by a boost to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume with margin. Good radiation quality control with central review improves local control. Use of an involved radiation field requires accuracy in defining tumor volume. Techniques to improve local control include risk-adapted multidisciplinary therapy, intraoperative boost radiation, and high radiation doses as delivered by 3-dimensional conformal radiation. Intensity modulated and proton beam radiotherapy may offer an advantage at special sites. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative uses of radiation in the multidisciplinary setting will continue to provide excellent local control, improved function, and quality of life for young patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone.

The observation period was less than 2 years for 4 cases, 2 to 5 years for 10 cases, 5 to 10 years for 7 cases and more than 10 years for 3 cases. Reabsorption of retinal detachment without any recurrency was obtained for all the cases. The V.A. was increased in 16 cases, did not change in 4 cases and decreased in 4 other cases. Final V.A. was 6/7.5 or more in 9 cases (37.5%), 6/60 a 6/7.5 in 6 cases (25%), and 6/60 or less in 9 cases (37.5%). None of the cases we treated presented complications induced by radiotherapy (actinic papillitis, circulatory disturbances in the macular area, or neovascular glaucoma). The comparison of the results we obtained with cases treated by photocoagulation or external radiotherapy demonstrated a slight advantage in favour of the focalized radiotherapy, which is not statistically significant because of the small number of cases included in the studies. Meanwhile, contact radiotherapy and irradiation with an accelerated proton beam seems to be a substantial alternative for the treatment of large hemangiomas and tumors invading the macula.

This morbidity (growth and developmental) is related to the exit dose of the beams and is particularly severe in young children. With the purpose of reducing this toxicity, a dosimetric study was undertaken in which proton therapy was compared to standard megavoltage photon treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The results of a comparative dosimetric study are presented in such a way that the dose distribution achievable with a posterior modulated 100 MeV proton beam (spot scanning method) is compared with that of a standard set of posterior 6 MV x-ray fields. The potential improvements with protons are evaluated, using dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the target as well as the dose to the vertebral bodies (growth plates), lungs, heart, and liver. RESULTS: The target (i.e., the spinal dural sac) received the full prescribed dose in both treatment plans. However, the proportions of the vertebral body volume receiving > or = 50% of the prescribed dose were 100 and 20% for 6 MV x-rays and protons, respectively. For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET. The potential bone marrow and growth arrest sparing effects make this approach specially attractive for intensive chemotherapy protocols and for very young children. Sparing the thyroid gland, the posterior heart wall, and the gonads may be additional advantages in assuring a long-term posttreatment morbidity-free survival

However, the proportions of the vertebral body volume receiving > or = 50% of the prescribed dose were 100 and 20% for 6 MV x-rays and protons, respectively. For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET. The potential bone marrow and growth arrest sparing effects make this approach specially attractive for intensive chemotherapy protocols and for very young children. Sparing the thyroid gland, the posterior heart wall, and the gonads may be additional advantages in assuring a long-term posttreatment morbidity-free survival

At least a 13 grays (Gy) irradiation dose has to be used, but high morbidity is observed in case of over 11 Gy irradiation. So, no therapeutic windows have been found despite the fact that more than 900 patients were included in clinical trials. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) uses alpha emitting nuclear reactions, produced within tumoral cells by boron neutron captures. (10)B is specifically loaded inside tumoral cells via a boronated molecule, and the tissues are then irradiated with thermal or epithermal neutrons. Although this type of irradiation is yet considered as a regular method in Japan, USA and Europe have started clinical trials, currently in progress, in order to define the BNCT place in the post-operative care of high grade glioma. Non-removable tumors may benefit from boron neutron capture enhancement of fast neutron irradiation, i.e. the combination of these two methods. Preliminary studies show that a "biological" dose enhancement of 20 % could be obtained within the tumor when a concentration of 100 microg/g of (10)B is targeted into it. These concentrations are achievable by intra-arterial administration of (10)boronophenylalanine (BPA) or borosulfhydryl (BSH). Recently, some publications have also demonstrated that the thermal neutron flux yielded within the irradiated tissues could be increased. Clinical trials, using this technique, are planned in USA and Europe

[French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Argon, Brachytherapy, Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Hemangioma/su [Surgery], Humans, Laser Coagulation, Male, Middle Aged, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Therapeutic retrospective results obtained after Argon laser photocoagulation of 17 circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas associated with serous retinal detachment were analyzed. All patients were symptomatic but one. Duration of visual symptoms varied from 2 weeks to 3 years. Mean tumor thickness was 3,3mm (1 to 6,5mm). Mean tumor diameter was 6,5mm (2.5 to 15mm). Tumors were juxtapapillary in 9 cases (57%). The mean distance from the fovea was 1,5mm (0 to 3mm), and the fovea was pathological in all cases but two. The tumoral surface was covered by Argon laser spots with the central avascular area spared in the case of subfoveal hemangioma. In the case of subretinal fluid persistence 3 months later, 1 or more photocoagulation sessions were carried out. Follow-up was 27 months (6 to 156 months). RESULTS: Success (complete subretinal fluid resolution) was obtained in 82.4% with 1 or 2 laser photocoagulation sessions. Recurrence was observed in 4 cases (23.5%) but treated with success. Final visual acuity, related to the initial foveal condition, was >=0.5 in 23.5% of cases, and >=0.1 in 70.6% of cases. DISCUSSION: Anatomical and functional results were satisfactory considering initial foveal conditions. Irradiation (external beam irradiation, proton beam therapy, brachytherapy) has been used with success for several years. However, radiation-induced damage was described in addition to a few practical disadvantages. CONCLUSION: Argon laser photocoagulation was an effective noninvasive therapy for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. It remains for us the reference method for treating this tumor

0	1577	Considerations of marrow cellularity in 3-dimensional dosimetric models of the trabecular skeleton	Adipocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Bone and Bones/re [Radiation Effects], Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow/pa [Pathology], Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Cadaver, Femur Head/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Humerus/re [Radiation Effects], Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry, Reference Values, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Dose assessment to active bone marrow is a critical feature of radionuclide therapy treatment planning. Skeletal dosimetry models currently used to assign radionuclide S values for clinical marrow dose assessment are based on bone and marrow cavity chord-length distributions. Accordingly, these models cannot explicitly consider energy loss to inactive marrow (adipose tissue) during particle transport across the trabecular marrow space (TMS). One method to account for this energy loss is to uniformly scale the resulting TMS absorbed fractions by reference values of site-specific marrow cellularity. In doing so, however, the resulting absorbed fractions for self-irradiation of the trabecular active marrow (TAM) do not converge to unity at low electron source energies. This study attempts to address this issue by using nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy images of trabecular bone to define 3-dimensional (3D) dosimetric models in which explicit spatial distributions of adipose tissue are introduced. METHODS: Cadaveric sources of trabecular bone were taken from both the femoral heads and humeral epiphyses of a 51-y-old male subject. The bone sites were sectioned and subsequently imaged at a proton resonance frequency of 200 MHz (4.7 T) using a 3D spin-echo pulse sequence. After image segmentation, voxel clusters of adipocytes were inserted interior to the marrow cavities of the binary images, which were then coupled to the EGS4 radiation transport code for simulation of active marrow electron sources. RESULTS: Absorbed fractions for self-irradiation of the TAM were tabulated for both skeletal sites. Substantial variations in the absorbed fraction to active marrow are seen with changes in marrow cellularity, particularly in the energy range of 100-500 keV. These variations are seen to be more dramatic in the humeral epiphysis (larger marrow volume fraction) than in the femoral head. CONCLUSION: Results from electron transport in 3D models of the trabecular skeleton indicate that current methods to account for marrow cellularity in chord-based models are incomplete. At 10 keV, for example, the Eckerman and Stabin model underestimates the self-absorbed fraction to active marrow by 75%. At 1 MeV, the model of Bouchet et al. overestimates this same value by 40%. In the energy range of 20-200 keV, neither model accurately predicts energy loss to the active bone marrow. Thus, it is proposed that future extensions of skeletal dosimetry models use 3D transport techniques in which explicit delineation of active and inactive marrow is feasible

We have extended these studies to human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines in order to establish an in vitro model system. The five cell lines analyzed, including one from a Fanconi anaemia patient, exhibited high levels of persistent chromatid aberrations up to approximately 40 cell generations after alpha-irradiation. The p53 status of the cell lines was defined according to whether cellular p53 levels were induced by irradiation, translocated to the nucleus and were able to bind a p53 DNA consensus recognition sequence in vitro. Together with the primary bone marrow cell studies, we conclude that alpha-particle induced chromosomal instability is independent of the p53 status of the cell as defined in these studies

However, acute and chronic neurotoxicity has been described following HDMTX therapy, and the long-term intellectual outcome in children treated in this way is inadequately documented. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain is a noninvasive, quantitative way of assessing aspects of cerebral metabolism, which has not previously been applied to the study of children undergoing central nervous system directed therapy. PROCEDURE: To evaluate the potential role of (1)H-MRS in the investigation of related neurotoxicity, 11 children who had received HDMTX (cumulative dose 6-96 g/m(2)) underwent localised (1)H-MRS, magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropsychological assessments were performed on the children who had more than 1 year of follow-up time since last methotrexate treatment. Control (1)H-MRS studies on 11 adult and 6 young volunteers were undertaken. Eight patients had spectra of adequate quality. Comparisons between (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios and normal controls were made. RESULTS: Patients had a low choline/water ratio compared to controls (P < 0.01). No differences between patient and control NAA/water, Cr/water, Naa/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios were seen. Overall, 3 patients had abnormal white matter changes on MRI. The mean IQ of the patients (104.1) was in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that choline depletion in the brains of these patients may reflect subclinical disturbances of myelin metabolism as a result of methotrexate therapy and may represent a possible avenue of treatment in patients with clinical chronic methotrexate-related neurotoxicity.

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that men with localized prostate cancer benefit from high-dose radiation therapy delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or proton beam therapy. Most importantly, neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy have significantly improved outcomes in men with locally advanced or high-risk prostate cancer.

Although questions remain regarding the optimal timing and duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy, a combination of long-term androgen deprivation started before radiation therapy and continued for 2 years represents a North American standard of care for this patient population.

1	743	Proton beam therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective review of 162 patients	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Palliative Care, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: We present results of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with proton beam therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed 162 patients having 192 HCCs treated from November 1985 to July 1998 by proton beam therapy with or without transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. The patients in the present series were considered unsuitable for surgery for various reasons, including hepatic dysfunction, multiple tumors, recurrence after surgical resection, and concomitant illnesses. The median total dose of proton irradiation was 72 Gy in 16 fractions over 29 days. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for all of the 162 patients was 23.5% at 5 years. The local control rate at 5 years was 86.9% for all 192 tumors among the 162 patients. The degree of impairment of hepatic functions attributable to coexisting liver cirrhosis and the number of tumors in the liver significantly affected patient survival. For 50 patients having least impaired hepatic functions and a solitary tumor, the survival rate at 5 years was 53.5%. The patients had very few acute reactions to treatments and a few late sequelae during and after the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC is effective, safe, well tolerable, and repeatable. It is the useful treatment mode for either cure or palliation for patients with HCC irrespective of tumor size, tumor location in the liver, insufficient feeding of the tumor with arteries, presence of vascular invasion, impaired hepatic functions, and coexisting intercurrent diseases

METHODS: Patients with invasive bladder cancer, stage T2-3N0M0, were included in the study. Intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed with three injections of methotrexate and cisplatin at 3-week intervals. Simultaneously, the patients underwent X-ray irradiation (40 Gy) of the small pelvic space. Where a post-treatment transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy showed no residual tumor, the tumor site was irradiated by a 30 Gy proton beam and the bladder was preserved. Where tumors remained, radical cystectomy was performed. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1996, 42 patients were treated according to this protocol. Post-treatment TUR biopsy and urine cytology showed no residual tumors in 39 of 42 cases (93%). The bladder was preserved in accordance with the study protocol in 36 cases. A median follow-up of 38 months showed 3-year non-recurrence in 72% of bladder-preserved patients and the rate of bladder preservation was 84%. The nine recurrences included eight cases of superficial bladder recurrence. One cancer death occurred among the bladder-preservation patients, giving 3-year survival and cause-specific survival rates of 84% and 100%, respectively. Although bladder function decreased slightly in compliance, bladder capacity was retained in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is useful for bladder preservation in T2-3 locally invasive bladder cancer. Information from more cases and the results of more long-term observations are needed, as is an evaluation of appropriate subject selection and factors associated with quality of life issues, particularly regarding bladder function

The German Thorotrast Study comprises 2326 Thorotrast patients and 1890 contemporary matched patients in the control group to be evaluated. 899 Thorotrast patients and 662 controls had clinical and biophysical follow-up examinations every two years since 1969. The recent most important results of the study are: A high excess rate of primary liver cancer (410/2) was observed beginning after the 15th year of exposure. 31% of the tumors are combined with cirrhosis and 6% with other neoplastic diseases. A clear (mean) dose rate effect relationship exists. The tumor frequency depends on the time of exposure or the cumulative dose to the liver respectively and not primarily on the age at injection. The lowest cumulative doses at 10 years before diagnosis of liver cancer were about 2 Gy. Risk estimates for liver cancer after 40 years of exposure are 500 malignant tumors per 10(4) person-Gy for men and 300 for women. A high excess rate exists also for leukaemias (excluding CLL) starting already 5 years after Thorotrast injection (39/4). The lowest cumulative doses to the red bone marrow at time of death were about 0.5 Gy. According to the present result, an excess rate can be expected for carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, oesophagus, larynx, as well as Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, bone sarcomas, plasmacytomas and mesotheliomas

0	4349	Neoplastic diseases induced by chronic alpha-irradiation--epidemiological, biophysical and clinical results of the German Thorotrast Study	Adolescent, Adult, Alpha Particles, Bone Marrow, Child, Child,Preschool, Contrast Media, Contrast Media/ae [Adverse Effects], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany/ep [Epidemiology], Humans, Infant, Larynx, Liver, Lymphoma, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Sarcoma, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Women	The intravascular injection of the formerly used contrast medium Thorotrast--a colloidal suspension of thorium-dioxide--causes a chronic exposure to alpha-particles especially in the organs of the reticuloendothelial system. The German Thorotrast Study comprises 2326 Thorotrast patients and 1890 contemporary matched patients in the control group to be evaluated. 899 Thorotrast patients and 662 controls had clinical and biophysical follow-up examinations every two years since 1969. The recent most important results of the study are: A high excess rate of primary liver cancer (410/2) was observed beginning after the 15th year of exposure. 31% of the tumors are combined with cirrhosis and 6% with other neoplastic diseases. A clear (mean) dose rate effect relationship exists. The tumor frequency depends on the time of exposure or the cumulative dose to the liver respectively and not primarily on the age at injection. The lowest cumulative doses at 10 years before diagnosis of liver cancer were about 2 Gy. Risk estimates for liver cancer after 40 years of exposure are 500 malignant tumors per 10(4) person-Gy for men and 300 for women. A high excess rate exists also for leukaemias (excluding CLL) starting already 5 years after Thorotrast injection (39/4). The lowest cumulative doses to the red bone marrow at time of death were about 0.5 Gy. According to the present result, an excess rate can be expected for carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, oesophagus, larynx, as well as Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, bone sarcomas, plasmacytomas and mesotheliomas	
1	136	Comparative treatment planning between proton and x-ray therapy in esophageal cancer	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage x-rays and protons for five patients with esophageal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of x-rays. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system

The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume

In published series it has been demonstrated that the external boost can be replaced by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) where irradiation at a single dose from 10 up to 15 Gy was safely delivered directly to the tumor bed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, we initiated a dose escalation study to investigate the feasibility of applying single doses of IORT from 10 Gy up to 22 Gy. A portable IORT equipment with different electron energies was used. From July to December 1999, a total of 65 patients with T1-2 (max. 2.5 cm) No-1 breast cancer, median age 58 years (range 33-80 years) was treated. Ten patients received 10 Gy, eight patients were treated with an IORT of 15 Gy, eight received 17 Gy, six had 19 Gy, and 33 were treated with 21-22 Gy. Patients with 10 and 15 Gy received an additional EBRT of 44 and 40 Gy, respectively. In all other patients IORT was the sole radiation treatment. RESULTS: No acute side effects or intermediate untoward effects after a follow-up from three to nine months related to IORT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Since the applicator can be safely placed under the control of the surgeon and radiotherapist IORT has the potential of accurately treating the tumor bed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis. With IORT single doses of 22 Gy being equivalent to a 60 Gy EBRT can safely be delivered. Even so the average time of operation was prolonged by around 20 minutes IORT application ultimately improves the quality of life of the patients in shortening overall treatment. Long-term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate whether large single doses of IORT might have the potential of sufficient local tumor control without major side effects. As a future perspective a randomized trial comparing EBRT with IORT as sole treatment will be performed

Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis. With IORT single doses of 22 Gy being equivalent to a 60 Gy EBRT can safely be delivered. Even so the average time of operation was prolonged by around 20 minutes IORT application ultimately improves the quality of life of the patients in shortening overall treatment. Long-term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate whether large single doses of IORT might have the potential of sufficient local tumor control without major side effects. As a future perspective a randomized trial comparing EBRT with IORT as sole treatment will be performed

Report of experiences from the European Institute of Oncology (EIO), Mailand].

In published series it has been demonstrated that the external boost can be replaced by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) where irradiation at a single dose from 10 up to 15 Gy was safely delivered directly to the tumor bed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, we initiated a dose escalation study to investigate the feasibility of applying single doses of IORT from 10 Gy up to 22 Gy. A portable IORT equipment with different electron energies was used. From July to December 1999, a total of 65 patients with T1-2 (max. 2.5 cm) No-1 breast cancer, median age 58 years (range 33-80 years) was treated. Ten patients received 10 Gy, eight patients were treated with an IORT of 15 Gy, eight received 17 Gy, six had 19 Gy, and 33 were treated with 21-22 Gy. Patients with 10 and 15 Gy received an additional EBRT of 44 and 40 Gy, respectively. In all other patients IORT was the sole radiation treatment. RESULTS: No acute side effects or intermediate untoward effects after a follow-up from three to nine months related to IORT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Since the applicator can be safely placed under the control of the surgeon and radiotherapist IORT has the potential of accurately treating the tumor bed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis. With IORT single doses of 22 Gy being equivalent to a 60 Gy EBRT can safely be delivered.

1	2684	Basic Treatment Equivalent (BTE): a new measure of linear accelerator workload	Australia, Efficiency, Hospital Departments/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Particle Accelerators/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Particle Accelerators/ut [Utilization], Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization], Time, Workload	The measurement of linear accelerator workload in radiation oncology departments is usually based on the number of fields treated per unit time. However, this approach ignores variations in treatment complexity. This prospective study, was designed to measure treatment workload directly, taking into account the variations in complexity of different treatment techniques. From this, a model was to be developed, which would be simple to apply and reproducible, both within and between radiation oncology departments in Australasia. It would provide a realistic basis for assessing treatment costs and enable the comparison of patient throughput between departments. This paper describes the derivation of the model. Over a 4-week period in the Radiation Oncology Department of Westmead Hospital, all fractions of radiotherapy were timed. The data collected included: tumour site; treatment intent; number of fields; number of wedges, compensators and shielding blocks; fraction number; patient age; performance status; and need for general anaesthesia. Multivariate modelling was performed to identify factors that significantly affected fraction duration, so that these could be used to develop a model of resource utilization. The durations of 2371 fractions were measured in 219 patients. Seventy-five per cent of fractions were given with radical intent. The factors found to influence fraction duration on multivariate modelling were: number of fields; number of shielding blocks; first treatment fraction; need for anaesthesia; and performance status. The number of wedges and compensators were also found to be significant but were not included in the model in order to maintain simplicity. This was felt to be necessary if the model is to be applied to the widest possible variety of machines. A model of resources utilization called 'Basic Treatment Equivalent' (BTE) was derived, which incorporated these factors. When tested at Westmead Hospital, this model accurately reflected the predicted BTE value over a further 1-week study period. This model of linear accelerator use, which incorporates complexity has been derived and evaluated in one radiation oncology department. This requires further prospective testing before its widespread use. The model appears to reflect linear accelerator workload better than previous measures. An Australasian study to validate the model further will be undertaken. If adopted, this model has implications for comparative workload reports, diagnostic-related groups, waiting list calculations, and patient scheduling

We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor; perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact. All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Another patient had progressive enhancement and low relative cerebral blood volume and flow; biopsy showed necrosis and inflammation. One patient had progressive enhancement and high choline levels (proved anaplastic astrocytoma). In another, T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis); enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up). CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor

In another, T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis); enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up). CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor

We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor; perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact. All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence.

The AR was found to be present in cells pre-exposed to 3 cGy of X-rays in G0, G1 and S phase as well as with tritiated water (4 muCi/ml) when the 'challenge' dose was given in G2. There was no AR after prior exposure of the cells in S phase to secondary irradiation from 70 GeV protons. The AR was not observed after preliminary X-irradiation of the lymphocytes in G0 and G1 and 'challenge' irradiation in G1. Cells from 6 patients with Down's syndrome were tested. At least 5 of them did not show the AR. The AR is considered to be a phenomenon of the antimutagenic aftereffect

The main purpose was to determine clinically useful fraction doses without severe acute reaction of normal tissues and to assess tumor control dose levels achievable without significant normal tissue toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment was given with four fixed fractions per week (24 fractions over 6 weeks) and was initiated with a fraction dose of 2.2 Gray equivalent (GyE), and the dose was increased as 2.4 GyE, 2.6 GyE, 2.8 GyE, and 3.0 GyE. Consequently, the total dose initiated was 52.8 GyE, to increase up to 72.0 GyE in 4.8-GyE increments in the dose-escalation fashion. Thirty patients with eligible advanced cervical cancers consisting of 27 squamous cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas were analyzed. RESULTS: Acute response of normal tissues was less than with photon treatment until fraction doses of 2.8 GyE were administered, and patients finished treatment with comfortable conditions. Severe late complications occurred in the two patients who received more than 67.2 GyE. The 2-year cumulative survival rate and the local control rate of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were 61.5% and 59.3%, respectively. According to stages, the 2-year survival rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 54.4% and 75.0%, respectively. The 2-year local control rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 52.6% and 75.0%, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results indicated that the disease control seems to be relatively better for very advanced disease and with dose escalation treatment. Local control was not significantly correlated with total dose and tumor volume. The results of the present study, despite small numbers and short observation, suggest that an adequate fraction dose for pelvis fields is 2.8 to 3.0 GyE and that the carbon beam therapy might be advantageous for advanced cervical cancer

Immunohistochemical overexpression of cyclin D1 was determined in paraffin-embedded specimens from diagnostic biopsies of 89 primary cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), using a polyclonal antiserum. The tumor response rates were estimated after curative treatment (i.e. surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Patients whose tumors were overexpressing cyclin D1 showed complete or partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-FU. In addition, a majority of cyclin D1 negative tumors did not respond at all to this treatment (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). This study indicates that immunohistochemical assessment of cyclin D1 expression in SCCHN could be a new predictive marker to select a subgroup of patients that will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy

Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues

IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues

Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity.

Proton radiation therapy has potential to reduce the risk of adverse events compared with conventional radiation, but it is associated with a higher treatment cost. The objective of the current study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of proton therapy compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma. METHODS: The consequences of radiation therapy were evaluated using a Markov simulation model. Children age 5 years with medulloblastoma were followed. The patients were at risk of several types of adverse events, including hearing loss, intelligence quotient (IQ) loss, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), osteoporosis, cardiac disease, and secondary malignancies. The patients also were at risk of death and were divided into risk groups for normal death, death due to tumor recurrence, treatment-related cardiac death, treatment-related subsequent tumor death, or treatment-related other death. A review of the literature was conducted to estimate the parameters in the model. RESULTS: The base-case results showed that proton therapy was associated with 23,600 in cost savings and 0.68 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The analyses showed that reductions in IQ loss and GHD contributed to the greatest part of the cost savings and were the most important parameters for cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated that proton radiation therapy can be cost-effective and cost-saving compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of children with medulloblastoma if the appropriate patients are selected for the therapy. However, there have been few long-term follow-up studies, and more much information on the long-term consequences of radiation therapy is needed. Copyright (c) 2005 American Cancer Society

In the former case, aneurysm and large AVM in the left visual tuber were causes of 4 hemorrhages. In the latter, AVM of subcortical nodes and internal capsule were responsible for single hemorrhage. The patients underwent intraoperative embolization of the anterior ciliary artery followed by its clipping. This allowed the authors to exclude aneurysm and to achieve obliteration of the bulk of AVM. Operation were performed under intraoperative guidance of motor and speech functions. Residual AVM were exposed to proton beam radiation. The outcomes of treatment were good. After 4 months of surgery, the male had no neurological disorders; in the female motor and speech disorders were associated with prior hemorrhage. [References: 10]

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 1997, 102 patients with multiple cancer metastases received half-body irradiation (HBI) at the Center of Oncology--Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute in Krakow. Most of the patients (93/102) had bone metastases (Table 1). The HBI was performed with 9 MV photon beam from linear accelerator. In 88 patients only one region (upper, mid or lower) was treated, and 14 patients received upper and lower HBI (13 patients), or upper and mid HBI (one patient) (Table 2). The mean doses were: 6 Gy in upper HBI, 8 Gy in mid HBI, and 9 Gy in lower HBI (Table 3). RESULTS: The positive palliative effect (complete or partial pain relief) was observed in 77 (75.5%) patients (Table 4). Complete pain relief was higher in patients with prostate cancer, and in patients who received mid or lower HBI. During follow-up 47 (46.1%) patients developed pain progression after treatment (Table 5). The probability of survival without pain progression was higher in patients who developed complete pain relief (86.7% at 6 months, 69.3% at 12 and 24 months) than in patients with partial response (52.9% at 6 months, 32.8% at 12 months, and 5.5% at 24 months) (Figure 1). In most of the patients (74/102, 72.5%) the tolerance was good. CONCLUSIONS: HBI is an efficient method for palliation in patients with multiple painful metastases

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphocytes of five healthy volunteers were irradiated with low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons with doses ranging between 0.01 and 2 Gy. After post-irradiation incubation, B- and T-cells were isolated via CD3 and CD19 immunomagnetic microbeads. MN were analysed in both subpopulations. To study the underlying mechanism of chromosomal radiosensitivity, cell extracts prepared from purified B- and T-cells were subjected to SDS-electrophoresis and electroblotting using antibodies directed against the DNA-PK repair enzymes Ku70/86 and DNA-PKcs. Activity measurements were performed using the SignaTECT DNA-dependent protein kinase assay. DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and rejoining was determined using constant-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: For low LET gamma-rays a higher MN yield was observed in B-cells than in T-cells, but only in those samples exposed to doses < 1 Gy. For 1 Gy, the MN yields were comparable and for 2Gy even lower in B-cells compared with T-cells. After high LET neutron irradiation no significant differences in MN yields were observed between both subsets. The results of the DNA-PK experiments demonstrate that there is no difference between T- and B-cells in the basal expression and activity of DNA-PK repair proteins. No differences in DNA DSB induction and rejoining were found between T- and B-cells using constant-field gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: From the results, it was concluded that the enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity in B-cells is restricted to low doses (<1 Gy) of low LET radiation and that the chromosomal behaviour of B-cells to low LET radiation cannot be attributed to aberrant forms of the DNA-PK components. A type of chromosomal induced radioresistance (IRR) may be a possible explanation for the observed effect

To take advantage of this effect, techniques have been developed that combine existing hyperthermia devices with a linear accelerator. This allows concomitant delivery of either ultrasound or microwave hyperthermia with photon radiation therapy. Two techniques have been used clinically: the orthogonal technique, in which the microwave or ultrasound beam and the radiation beam are orthogonal to one another, and the en face technique, in which the ultrasound or microwave beam and the radiation beam travel into the tumour through the same treatment window. The en face technique has necessitated the development of special attachments so that the hyperthermia device can be mounted to the linear accelerator and so that non-uniform portions of the hyperthermia device can be removed from the radiation beam. For microwave therapy, applicators are mounted onto the linear accelerator using the compensating filter tray holder. For ultrasound, special reflector devices are mounted to a frame that is mounted onto the compensating filter tray holder of the linear accelerator. Because the linear accelerator is an isocentric device, the height of the radiation source is fixed, and this has necessitated specially designed devices so that the ultrasound support system is compatible with the linear accelerator. The treatment setups for both the en face technique and the orthogonal technique require the interaction of both hyperthermia and radiation therapy personnel and equipment. The dosimetry and day-to-day operations for each technique are unique. The simulation for the en face technique is much different from the simulation of a normal radiation treatment and requires the presence of a hyperthermia physicist. Also, for the en face technique, the attenuation of the microwave applicator and the thickness and attenuation of the ultrasound reflector system are taken into account for radiation dosimetry. This paper presents details of the dosimetry and logistics of the techniques for simultaneous thermoradiotherapy based on 7 years of experience treating more than 50 patients

We sought to determine the value of proton MR spectroscopy in assessing brain tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child's treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: In children with brain tumors, MR spectroscopy of brain tissue remote from the tumor reveals treatment-related biochemical changes

1	2006	Evaluation of polymer gels and MRI as a 3-D dosimeter for intensity-modulated radiation therapy	Biophysics, Calibration, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Film Dosimetry, Gels, Germany, Glass, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Polymers, Radiation, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Time	BANG gel (MGS Research, Inc., Guilford, CT) has been evaluated for measuring intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose distributions. Treatment plans with target doses of 1500 cGy were generated by the Peacock IMRT system (NOMOS Corp., Sewickley, PA) using test target volumes. The gels were enclosed in 13 cm outer diameter cylindrical glass vessels. Dose calibration was conducted using seven smaller (4 cm diameter) cylindrical glass vessels irradiated to 0-1800 cGy in 300 cGy increments. Three-dimensional maps of the proton relaxation rate R2 were obtained using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) and correlated with dose. A Hahn spin echo sequence was used with TR = 3 s, TE = 20 and 100 ms, NEX = 1, using 1 x 1 x 3 mm3 voxels. The MRI measurements were repeated weekly to identify the gel-aging characteristics. Ionization chamber, thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD), and film dosimetry measurements of the IMRT dose distributions were obtained to compare against the gel results. The other dosimeters were used in a phantom with the same external cross-section as the gel phantom. The irradiated R2 values of the large vessels did not precisely track the smaller vessels, so the ionization chamber measurements were used to normalize the gel dose distributions. The point-to-point standard deviation of the gel dose measurements was 7.0 cGy. When compared with the ionization chamber measurements averaged over the chamber volume, 1% agreement was obtained. Comparisons against radiographic film dose distribution measurements and the treatment planning dose distribution calculation were used to determine the spatial localization accuracy of the gel and MRI. Spatial localization was better than 2 mm, and the dose was accurately determined by the gel both within and outside the target. The TLD chips were placed throughout the phantom to determine gel measurement precision in high- and low-dose regions. A multidimensional dose comparison tool that simultaneously examines the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement was used to evaluate the gel in both low-and high-dose gradient regions. When 3% and 3 mm criteria were used for the comparisons, more than 90% of the TLD measurements agreed with the gel, with the worst of 309 TLD chip measurements disagreeing by 40% of the criteria. All four MRI measurement session gel-measured dose distributions were compared to evaluate the time behavior of the gel. The low-dose regions were evaluated by comparison with TLD measurements at selected points, while high-dose regions were evaluated by directly comparing measured dose distributions. Tests using the multidimensional comparison tool showed detectable degradation beyond one week postirradiation, but all low-dose measurements passed relative to the test criteria and the dose distributions showed few regions that failed

Treatment relies on a fixation system that permits a precise use of the coordinates estimated at stereotactic angiography or stereotactic computed tomography. The field of treatment can be exactly outlined in the CT images during repeat examinations, thus facilitating the recognition of changes induced by radiation. The system also allows the extent of the arteriovenous malformation, as seen at angiography, to be accurately traced in the CT sections thus enabling evaluation of possible radiation damage to surrounding brain structures. The precision of the method as well as its hypothetical merits and disadvantages are discussed. The number of patients treated is still small and the follow-up time is too short in the majority of cases to allow definite conclusions. Examples of preliminary results are given

0	2160	Dependence of linac output on the switch rate of an intensity-modulated tomotherapy collimator	Boston, England, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Time, Travel, Universities	The electro-mechanical, multivane intensity modulated collimator ("MIMiC") slit collimator with 40 vanes has been applied in the delivery of inversely planned sequential tomotherapy to over 4,000 patients. The collimator is binary in that each vane switches between fully open or closed status. Resulting beamlet patterns provide the intensity distributions imparting dose to the patient. The bouncing and damping of vanes at the two ends of their travel cause transient dose perturbations near and at the borders of the treatment field. These perturbations are not explicitly modeled by the planning system. Clinical beamlet profiles and output factors may then differ from those in the planning system and as a function of the vane switch period. A mechanical model of vane switching was developed to describe this dependency. Dose output and distribution of seven simple vane patterns with different switch times were measured with ionization chambers and radiographic films in polystyrene and anthropomorphic phantoms. Linac output dependence on switch time relative to vane open time was determined for four intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) patients from measurements of an ionization chamber embedded in a cylindrical polystyrene phantom. Results demonstrate output dependence on switch time and, accordingly, on the servo mechanism for monitor units, arc length, dose rate, and gantry speed. In conclusion, the output dependence borders on clinical significance-improvements to collimator, dose calculation, commissioning, and quality assurance (QA) are suggested	
1	4367	Precise positioning of patients for radiation therapy	Casts,Surgical, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Immobilization, Movement, Neck, Posture, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Supine Position	We have developed a number of immobilization schemes which permit precise daily positioning of patients for radiation therapy. Pretreatment and post-treatment radiographs have been taken with the patient in the treatment position and analyzed to determine the amount of intratreatment movement. Studies of patients in the supine, seated and decubitus positions indicate mean movements of less than 1 mm with a standard deviation of less than 1mm. Patients immobilized in the seated position with a bite block and a mask have a mean movement of about 0.5 mm +/- 0.3 mm (s.d.), and patients immobilized in the supine position with their necks hyperextended for submental therapy evidence a mean movement of about 1.4 mm +/- 0.9 mm (s.d.). With the exception of those used for the decubitus position, the immobilization devices are simply fabricated out of thermoplastic casting materials readily available from orthopedic supply houses. A study of day-to-day reproducibility of patient position using laser alignment and pretreatment radiographs for final verification of position indicates that the initial laser alignment can be used to position a patient within 2.2 mm +/- 1.4 mm (s.d.) of the intended position. These results indicate that rigid immobilization devices can improve the precision of radiotherapy, which would be advantageous with respect to both tumor and normal tissue coverage in certain situations

Pretreatment and post-treatment radiographs have been taken with the patient in the treatment position and analyzed to determine the amount of intratreatment movement. Studies of patients in the supine, seated and decubitus positions indicate mean movements of less than 1 mm with a standard deviation of less than 1mm. Patients immobilized in the seated position with a bite block and a mask have a mean movement of about 0.5 mm +/- 0.3 mm (s.d.), and patients immobilized in the supine position with their necks hyperextended for submental therapy evidence a mean movement of about 1.4 mm +/- 0.9 mm (s.d.). With the exception of those used for the decubitus position, the immobilization devices are simply fabricated out of thermoplastic casting materials readily available from orthopedic supply houses.

1	3899	The influence of computer tomography on treatment strategies and follow-up in tumors of the nasopharynx and the paranasal sinuses. A retrospective study on 104 patients	Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Methods, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Retreatment, Retrospective Studies, Skull, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	BACKGROUND: The high value of computer tomography (CT) for detailed imaging of nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinus tumors is known. Less known is the influence of such diagnostic findings on decisions of the therapist. An analysis of this influence might help to compare the value of CT and MRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 104 treated patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx (n = 54) and the paranasal sinuses (n = 50). The study analyzed the influence of CT on primary tumor diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment decision, therapy planning, detection and time of recurrences and retreatment of relapses. RESULTS: Tumors of the nasopharynx: The value of CT for tumor staging was 76% but there was no influence on treatment decision. Radiotherapy planning was influenced in 37% of cases. CT for follow-up was done in 22% of cases. Most relapses occurred within the first 2 years. Paranasal sinus tumors: There was no influence of CT on primary diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor staging was influenced by CT in 94%, treatment decision in 44% and radiotherapy planning in 60%. CT control immediately after therapy was of value in 40%. Most relapses were found within 3 years but some in the 4th and 5th year. Some patients survived 3 to 9 years after retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In tumors of the nasopharynx there is less influence of CT on therapy strategies than diagnostic radiologists might think. No CT is needed for treatment decision since radiotherapy is the only choice of treatment. CT influenced radiotherapy planning however, in about 1/3 of our cases answering sufficiently the 2 main questions: tumor spread into the anterior half of the facial skull or involvement of the base of skull. The retreatment of recurrences detected by CT showed poor results. Late recurrences seem to have better prognosis. We recommend therefore routinely 1 basic CT 6 months after primary treatment followed by 1 CT yearly from the 3rd to 5th year. MRT might offer more diagnostic details than CT. However, at present therapy is not influenced much by this. Since CT is cheaper and faster, MRT could be discussed as additional procedure when CT presents equivocal findings and this fact could be decisive for therapy planning. Paranasal sinus tumors: The influence of CT on tumor-staging and treatment decision is high and convincing. CT helps also at radiotherapy planning and control of tumor response after therapy. CT has high value in detecting recurrences. Retreatment could control disease in some of our patients for 3 to 9 years. Better results could be achieved possibly with earlier diagnosis of recurrence. We propose therefore a basic-CT 6 months after first treatment and 1 CT routinely from the 2nd to 5th year. From the therapist's point of view we recommend CT as first imaging procedure in sinonasal tumors. MRT, more time- and cost consuming, should be applied when CT is equivocal and treatment decision could be influenced

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases

[Italian]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Care, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time, Wound Healing	We evaluated the tolerance of a single dose of 800-1500 cGy, delivered with an electron beam from an IOERT-dedicated linear accelerator to the tumour bed in patients with breast cancer undergoing conservative treatment, instead of the traditional boost. We enrolled 27 patients (cT1-2, cN0). The first 6 received a dose of 800 cGy, 6 1000 cGy, 10 1200 cGy and 5 1500 cGy. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with a conventional schedule, 4000 cGy total dose, was performed after wound healing. The median gap between IOERT and EBRT was 8 weeks. Three patients with adverse prognostic factors undergoing chemotherapy, including doxorubicin or taxanes, received EBRT after completion of chemotherapy. One patient with a prosthesis implant had yielding of the surgical scar 8 months after IOERT (after 4 cycles of doxorubicin and 4 cycles of CMF complicated by frequent mastitis). Another patient with a large serum collection in the axilla manifested delayed scar formation. In the others no significant increase in healing time or surgery-related morbidity was observed. Another 4 patients developed mastitis. The cosmetic outcome was good in 26/27 patients. This treatment is well tolerated at all IOERT doses delivered. In the follow-up, to date, there have been no local relapses

Three patients with adverse prognostic factors undergoing chemotherapy, including doxorubicin or taxanes, received EBRT after completion of chemotherapy. One patient with a prosthesis implant had yielding of the surgical scar 8 months after IOERT (after 4 cycles of doxorubicin and 4 cycles of CMF complicated by frequent mastitis). Another patient with a large serum collection in the axilla manifested delayed scar formation. In the others no significant increase in healing time or surgery-related morbidity was observed. Another 4 patients developed mastitis. The cosmetic outcome was good in 26/27 patients. This treatment is well tolerated at all IOERT doses delivered. In the follow-up, to date, there have been no local relapses

Where as in former time treatment consists in excision of the tumour with following conventional X-ray therapy, since 1973 therapy of choice was radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphonodectomy. Based on these facts a retrospective comparison of the survival rates in possible, particularly distribution of stages is likely the same in the two groups. The group treated since 1973 has essential better survival rates. This can be attributed to the conception of radical operative treatment preferred in literature predominantly. Mortality rate is below 5 per cent which will be favourable in the geriatric clientele. To make the results of treatment comparable internationally a postoperative classification should be proposed like in breast cancer. The question of the position of an additional postoperative irradiation is to be answered only with aid of a prospective multicenter study

Eight patients (seven males and one female) were suffering from over-irradiation syndrome as a result of treatments from a malfunctioning linear electron accelerator. The mean accidental estimated dose was 136 Gy delivered to the "open-neck" (seven cases) and to the thoracic wall (one case), during a mean of 5.4 sessions (range 1-9 sessions). Paresthesia and weakness in the upper extremities were the earliest symptoms (87.5 %), with evolution to paralysis in all patients. No patient is alive (mean survival time 64 days). In all cases MRI was negative for neurologic lesions in the acute phase ( < 90 days from irradiation; Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system). Late signs of radiation myelitis manifested as high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images in three patients, and as Gd-DTPA enhancement of T1-weighted images in one case. Autopsies performed on four patients who died in acute phase showed morphologic alterations in white matter: edema in 75 %, and necrosis and glial reaction as well as obliterative vasculitis in all cases. In cases of over-irradiation, MRI may be normal in acute phase even if the patients have severe neurologic deficit, as positive MRI findings appear only in delayed radiation myelitis

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

A 50 MeV cyclotron was used to deliver 9 Gy in a single fraction through 7 to 14 isocentric portals. The size and shape of the portals were customized to each treatment site. Nineteen patients have been followed for a median duration of 24 months following neutron radiosurgery. A radiographically demonstrable partial response was seen in 8 patients (42%). No complete responses were observed. There has been one post-treatment hemorrhage, no fatalities, and no evidence of radiation toxicity. The low response rate and absence of toxicity suggest that the appropriate dose for neutron radiosurgical treatment of AVMs is higher than the dose of 9 Gy at isocenter used in this initial study

1	3799	New compensator design options for charged-particle radiotherapy	California, Californium, Equipment Design, Humans, Motion, Movement, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skull Base, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods], Universities	The purpose of this investigation is to propose new compensator design strategies for protons and heavier particles which are based on pencil-beam (PB) dose calculations and which significantly reduce the dose to tissues downstream from the target, yet provide acceptable target coverage under conditions of patient motion. Averaging and expansion operations are provided to improve the target coverage if the patient moves slightly during treatment, and a structure-sparing option is provided to protect critical structures lying downstream from the target. The new compensator design options were evaluated for two patients who had skull-base tumours. When the patient and compensator were perfectly aligned, the new PB compensator designs provided target coverage comparable to, if not better than, standard compensator designs for both patients. Furthermore, the volume of normal tissue distal to the target which received in excess of 95% of the prescription dose was roughly a factor of two lower for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In the event of patient motion, on average, the volume of the target receiving 95% or more of the prescribed dose was 3% less for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In conclusion, the new compensator design options evaluated in this investigation provide better protection for normal tissues distal to the target volume than standard compensator designs, with only a modest decrease in target volume coverage in the event of patient motion

This is the first multivariate study related to liver cancer among Mayak workers. The study was performed using the nested, case-control approach and includes 44 cases of malignant liver tumors diagnosed from 1972 to 1999, and 111 matched controls. Adjusted odds ratio (OR(ad)) was evaluated relative to a group of workers with alpha radiation doses to liver (D(alpha)) < 2.0 Gy. Dose estimates of D(alpha) > 2.0 Gy (corresponding (239)Pu body burden estimates >20.4 kBq) were significantly associated (p < 0.003) with the occurrence of hemangiosarcomas (HAS) but only marginal significance (0.05 < p < 0.1) was found for hepatocellular cancers (HCC). The ORad for HAS was 41.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6, 333] for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-5.0 Gy and was 62.5 (7.4, 500) for a group with D(alpha) > 5.0-16.9 Gy. The attributable risk (AR) was calculated as 82%. For HCC, O(Rad) was estimated as 8.4 (0.8, 85.3; p < 0.07) for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-9.3 Gy. For the indicated group, the AR was 14%. An association with high external gamma-ray doses (D(gamma)) to the total body was revealed for both HCC and for combined liver cancers when dose was treated as a continuous variable. However, we find no evidence that chronic low doses of gamma rays are associated with liver cancer occurrence. Cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) was not associated with either alpha- or gamma-ray exposure. As expected, an association between alcohol abuse and HCC was inferred [O(Rad) = 3.3 (1.2, 9); AR = 41%] but not for CHC or HAS

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects

0	677	A new option for early breast cancer patients previously irradiated for Hodgkin's disease: intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT)	Breast, Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Hodgkin Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Intraoperative Period, Italy, Mastectomy, Neoplasms,Second Primary/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Second Primary/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk	INTRODUCTION: Patients who have undergone mantle radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease (HD) are at increased risk of developing breast cancer. In such patients, breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by breast irradiation is generally considered contraindicated owing to the high cumulative radiation dose. Mastectomy is therefore recommended as the first option treatment in these women. METHODS: Six patients affected by early breast cancer previously treated with mantle radiation for HD underwent BCS associated with full-dose intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT). RESULTS: A total dose of 21 Gy (prescribed at 90% isodose) in five cases and 17 Gy (at 100% isodose) in one case were delivered directly to the mammary gland without acute complications and with good cosmetic results. After an average of 30.8 months of follow up, no late sequelae were observed and the patients are free of disease. CONCLUSION: In patients previously irradiated for HD, ELIOT can avoid repeat irradiation of the whole breast, permit BCS and decrease the number of avoidable mastectomies

The NIRS (National Institute For Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan) was the first dedicated medical centre for cancer with more than 1200 patients exclusively treated with carbon ion from 1994. A three-year 70 to 100% local control was reported for radio-resistant cancers, supporting the use of high LET particles. Hypo-fractionation was particularly explored for lung cancers and hepatocarcinoma (4 sessions only). Dose escalation studies demonstrated a tumour dose-effect and permitted to precise dose constraints for healthy tissues especially for the rectum. More than 140 patients were treated with carbon ion exclusively or associated with photons since 1997 in the GSI laboratory Gesellschaft Fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany). A very high local control was also obtained for radioresistant cancer of the base of the skull. Preliminary clinical data seem to confirm the expected therapeutic gain with light ions, due to their ballistic and radio-biological properties, and justify the European projects for the construction of dedicated medical facilities for cancers. The French "Etoile" project will be integrated in the European hadrontherapy network "Enlight", with the objectives to coordinate technologic, medical and economic features

A three-year 70 to 100% local control was reported for radio-resistant cancers, supporting the use of high LET particles. Hypo-fractionation was particularly explored for lung cancers and hepatocarcinoma (4 sessions only). Dose escalation studies demonstrated a tumour dose-effect and permitted to precise dose constraints for healthy tissues especially for the rectum. More than 140 patients were treated with carbon ion exclusively or associated with photons since 1997 in the GSI laboratory Gesellschaft Fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany). A very high local control was also obtained for radioresistant cancer of the base of the skull. Preliminary clinical data seem to confirm the expected therapeutic gain with light ions, due to their ballistic and radio-biological properties, and justify the European projects for the construction of dedicated medical facilities for cancers. The French "Etoile" project will be integrated in the European hadrontherapy network "Enlight", with the objectives to coordinate technologic, medical and economic features	
1	4750	Proton beam radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma: the Liverpool-Clatterbridge experience	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Choroid Neoplasms, Cyclotrons, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, pathology, Patients, Prospective Studies, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Safety, surgery, Survival Analysis, Treatment Failure, Universities, Vision, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: To report on outcomes after proton beam radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma using a 62-MeV cyclotron in patients considered unsuitable for other forms of conservative therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location

METHODS: Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T2-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases

1	2094	Conformal proton beam therapy of prostate cancer--update on the Loma Linda University medical center experience	Actuarial Analysis, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: The ability to eradicate localized prostate cancer is dependent upon the radiation dose which can be delivered to the prostate. This dose is often limited by the tolerance of normal organs (rectum, bladder). Conformal beam therapy takes advantage of the unique depth dose characteristics of heavy charged particles (the Bragg Peak) to escalate the radiation dose delivered to the prostate while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. METHOD: 643 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons alone or a combination of protons and photons. All treatment was planned on a 3-D planning system and all received doses between 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE/day. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response to treatment. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates for the entire group are 89 and 79% respectively. A statistically significant difference in biochemical disease-free survival was seen between patients in the "early" (T1b-2b, PSA < 15) and "advanced" (T1b-2b, PSA > 15 or T2c-T4, PSA < 50) subgroups (89% vs. 68% at 4.5 years, p < 0.001). A PSA nadir of less than 0.51 ng/ml predicted for the highest chance of freedom from biochemical recurrence. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton beams therapy produced high rates of response and minimal toxicity. A phase III dose escalation trial is in progress to help define the optimum radiation dose for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer

1	380	Survival after primary enucleation for choroidal melanoma: changes induced by the introduction of conservative therapies	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Eye Enucleation/mo [Mortality], Female, Humans, Knowledge, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: Most uveal melanomas are currently treated by eye-preserving radiotherapies. However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling

CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling

However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis.

DESIGN: Randomized dose-ranging clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with angiographic evidence of classic choroidal neovascularization resulting from AMD and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better. METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 16-cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) or 24-CGE proton radiation in 2 equal fractions. Visual acuity was measured using standardized protocol refraction. Complete ophthalmological examinations, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of eyes losing 3 or more lines of vision from baseline. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare cumulative rates of vision loss between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS: At 12 months after treatment, 36 eyes (42%) and 27 eyes (35%) lost 3 or more lines of vision in the 16-CGE and 24-CGE groups, respectively. Rates increased to 62% in the 16-CGE group and 53% in the 24-CGE group by 24 months after treatment (P = 0.40). Radiation complications developed in 15.7% of patients receiving 16 CGE and 14.8% of patients receiving 24 CGE. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in rates of visual loss were found between the 2 dose groups. Proton radiation may be useful as an adjuvant therapy or as an alternative for patients who decline or are not appropriate for approved therapies

METHODS: Between 1993 and 2001, 42 patients with meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery at our institution. A mean radiation dose of 14 Gy was delivered to the tumor margin. The median tumor volume was 8.2 cm3 (mean, 8.4 cm3). Median follow-up was 36 months (mean, 38 mo). RESULTS: Control of tumor growth was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. There was no mortality or permanent extraocular motor or pituitary dysfunction. Treatment-related complications included new trigeminal neuropathy in 4.7% and a new visual field defect in 2.8%. Two patients required shunt placement after developing hydrocephalus. One patient with symptomatic temporal lobe edema underwent partial excision of the tumor. Improvement of existing cranial neuropathies was noted in 29% of affected trigeminal nerves, in 22% of oculomotor nerves, and in 13% of Cranial Nerves IV and VI. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that linear accelerator radiosurgery can achieve a high control rate of meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus with no mortality and a low incidence of morbidity

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function

PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to low LET-irradiation at: (1) low-dose rate (LDR, 1-3 Gy, 0.024 Gy h[-1]) in order to minimize genotoxic stress; (2) high dose rate (HDR, 1-3 Gy, 45 Gy h[-1]) followed by immediate mitogen stimulation; and (3) HDR followed by a recovery period of 5 days before mitogen stimulation. Subsequent analyses included cell viability and clonogenic cell survival, chromosome aberrations at the first post-irradiation mitosis, and karyotype analysis of long term cultured cells, 11-57 days after mitogen stimulation. RESULTS: Dose (1-3 Gy) and dose rate (LDR and HDR) effects on the frequency of dicentric chromosomes at the first post-irradiation mitosis were in agreement with published data, with a pronounced dose rate effect of 2 and 3 Gy exposures. G-handed karyotypes after 11 days of growth in vitro showed increased frequencies of chromosome breaks and rearrangements in all irradiated cell cultures. Clones with complex karyotype abnormalities and increased frequencies of de novo aberrations developed in the irradiated cultures during extended growth for 22-57 days. These results show that: (1) LDR-irradiation induces chromosomal instability in primary human lymphocytes; (2) mitogen stimulation rescues HDR-irradiated cells from death at the expense of an increased level of chromosome aberrations; and (3) HDR-irradiated cells that are allowed 5 days of recovery before mitogen stimulation develop chromosomal instability during subsequent long-term proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the acute genotoxic stress of HDR-irradiation compared with LDR-irradiation, nor the hypothesized conflict between mitogen-induced growth stimulation and irradiation-induced growth arrest, seem to be critical conditions for the development of chromosomal instability in primary human T lymphocytes. Post-irradiation incubation allowing apoptotic processes to remove damaged cells does not prevent the subsequent development of chromosomal instability during long-term cell proliferation

Ideally, the particle selected to deliver ionizing radiation for routine therapy should control the disease, cause minimal side effects, and be affordable. Two major properties for judging the utility of a particle, physical controllability and selective cell destruction, influence the decision for selection. The proton, at present, has the best combination of capabilities for routine radiation therapy. Heavier ions require further study to determine their role in patient treatment

The melanomas measured 7 to 15 mm at the tumor base and 2 t0 5 mm thick. First, photocoagulation using the green argon laser was aimed at closing the choroidal vascular supply of the tumor. In a second stage, tumor tissue was destroyed using the red krypton laser for confluent burns of long duration. Such treatment was supplemented by cryotherapy in peripherally located tumors or whenever photocoagulation alone did not result in tumor regression. Photocoagulation alone was used in ten eyes and combined wih cryotherapy in seven. After an average follow-up of 42 months, marked tumor regression was achieved in 12 eyes and some tumor regression in two. Tow eyes ultimately required proton beam irradiation, and one eye was enucleated. No metastasis occurred during follow-up

IORT has been recently used in early stage cancer as an exclusive radiation modality, rather than as a boost, especially for breast tumours, in particular at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, where the technique has been called electron intraoperative therapy (ELIOT). Our studies on more than 1000 patients have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique and it is expected that its application will become more widespread in the immediate future. It is important to emphasise that ELIOT relies not only on new technological developments, but also on a multidisciplinary team with clear roles and responsibilities, the establishment of a programme of quality assurance with appropriate guidelines and a comprehensive staff development programme

In spite of the most aggressive therapies, the control of metastatic prostate cancer remains an elusive objective and many patients die of secondary disease. Targeted alpha-therapy is an emerging therapeutic modality whereby a labeled protein selectively targets cancer cells and delivers a lethal payload, which can kill cancer cells in transit or preangiogenic cell clusters. Recent studies show that targeted alpha-therapy is highly cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells in vitro and can inhibit tumor growth in animal models. This review will consider alpha-emitting radionuclides and current in vitro and in vivo studies with alpha-radioconjugates, and will focus on cell-surface target antigens and targeting vectors for the treatment of prostate cancer.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective longitudinal study of 485 low back pain patients was carried. We assess the type of pain and its irradiation, evolution in time, duration of the episodes, timetable, intensity and morning stiffness. A complete physical examination with specific tests for sacroiliac joints and neurologic examination was carried. We carried out a study of absolute and relative frequencies; calculating the rates with the chi 2 Pearson test and having a confidence of 95%. RESULTS: We found a significant relation (p < 0.0001) between the type of pain and the diagnosis groups. Proximal irradiation with functional disorders (p < 0.01) and metabolic bone diseases (p < 0.0001); the radicular irradiation and the disorders by physical agents (p < 0.001). The flare-up back pain with disorders by physical agents and metabolic bone diseases (p < 0.001). The morning stiffness was exclusive in the inflammatory diseases. In the physical examination, was found a significant relation (p < 0.0001) between the different tests with the diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: The history and the physical examination provide us symptoms and signs which let us direct towards the above diagnostic. The type of pain with its characteristics and the referred pain as a main symptoms, give us some information, which complemented with the physical examination tests, providing the base on which we support our diagnostic hypothesis, allow us the first classification of the patients; at the same time we understand as a low back pain patients suffer its problem

1	1426	Evidence-based estimates of outcome in patients irradiated for intraocular melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Child, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Likelihood Functions, Liver, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Probability, Prognosis, Radiation, Recurrence, Risk, Risk Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Melanoma of the eye is the only potentially fatal ocular malignancy in adults. Until radiation therapy gained wide acceptance in the 1980s, enucleation was the standard treatment for the tumor. Long-term results after proton beam irradiation are now available. METHODS: We developed risk score equations to estimate probabilities of the 4 principal treatment outcomes-local tumor recurrence, death from metastasis, retention of the treated eye, and vision loss-based on an analysis of 2069 patients treated with proton beam radiation for intraocular melanoma between July 10, 1975, and December 31, 1997. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 9.4 years. RESULTS: Tumor regrowth occurred in 60 patients, and 95% of tumors (95% confidence interval, 93%-96%) were controlled locally at 15 years. Risk scores were developed for the other 3 outcomes studied. Overall, the treated eye was retained by 84% of patients (95% confidence interval, 80%-87%) at 15 years. The probabilities for vision loss (visual acuity worse than 20/200) ranged from 100% to 20% at 10 years and for death from tumor metastases from 95% to 35% at 15 years, depending on the risk group. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose radiation treatment was highly effective in achieving local control of intraocular melanomas. In most cases, the eye was salvaged, and functional vision was retained in many patients. The mortality rate was high in an identifiable subset of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapies directed at microscopic liver metastases

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies

[Review] [24 refs] [French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Child, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Aneurysm/su [Surgery], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ep [Epidemiology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pa [Pathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Paris/ep [Epidemiology], Protons, Radiosurgery, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a challenge for embolization, surgery and radiosurgery too. The purposes of this study is to review results of RS for these large cerebral arteriovenous malformations and to study recent methods which can allow to improve results. PATIENTS: and method. From our series, 112 patients had cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 30 mm or 10 cc at time of the radiosurgery. Revelation mode was hemorrhage in 47%, seizures in 42%, headaches in 16%, and progressive neurological deficits in 7%. Discovery was fortuitous in 2.7% of cases. Before radiosurgery, 57% were embolized, 5% were operated, 4.5% were reirradiated and 1.8% were operated and embolized. Distribution according to Spetzler & Martin's grade was following: 0% in grade I, 12% in grade II, 41% in grade III and 46% in grade IV. No patient was in grade V. RESULTS: Global obliteration rate was 39% for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations. In multivariate analysis, only recovering (positive correlation), and previous embolization (negative correlation) were correlated with obliteration rate. CONCLUSION: Current procedures of radiosurgery allow obliteration in a limited number of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated. Other strategies as fractioned irradiation, multileaf microcollimators with single isocenter, radiosurgery before surgery or radiosurgery with protons should improve obliteration rate.

In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The G2 assay was performed on blood samples of four healthy donors who were irradiated with low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons. In a first set of experiments a dose-response curve for the formation of chromatid breaks was carried out for gamma-rays and neutrons with doses ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 Gy. In a second set of experiments, the kinetics of chromatid break formation and disappearance were investigated after a dose of 0.5 Gy using post-irradiation times ranging between 0.5 and 3.5 h. For the highest dose of 0.5 Gy, the number of isochromatid breaks was also scored. RESULTS: No significant differences in the number of chromatid breaks were observed between low-LET gamma-rays and high-LET neutrons for the four donors at any of the doses given. The dose-response curves for the formation of chromatid breaks are linear for both radiation qualities and RBEs = 1 were obtained. Scoring of isochromatid breaks at the highest dose of 0.5 Gy revealed that high-LET neutrons were, however, more effective at inducing isochromatid breaks (RBE = 6.2). The rejoining experiments further showed that the kinetics of disappearance of chromatid breaks following irradiation with low-LET gamma-rays or high-LET neutrons were not significantly different. Half-times of 0.92 h for gamma-rays and 0.84 h for neutrons were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the G2 assay, the results demonstrate that at low doses of irradiation, the induction as well as the disappearance of chromatid breaks is independent of the LET of the radiation qualities used (0.24 keV x microm(-1) 60Co gamma-rays and 20 keV x microm(-1) fast neutrons). As these radiation qualities produce the same initial number of double-strand breaks, the results support the signal model that proposes that chromatid breaks are the result of an exchange process which is triggered by a single double-strand break

Twenty-seven patients were treated with SRS (18 AVMs < 2.5 cm at non-eloquent area, nine patients who were unfit for prolonged ring-wearing). The most frequent minimum dose (Dmin) was 20 Gy for SRS and 28 Gy for HFSR in four fractions. The mean follow-up duration was 34.6 months for SRS and 35.4 months for HFSR. RESULTS: As a whole, the 3 and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 64 and 92%. Age <20 years old (P=0.02) and a maximum diameter <2 cm were favorable factors (P=0.05). A difference in the distribution of patients was observed in size (> or =2.5 cm or not) (P<0.001) and location (eloquent or not) (P<0.001) between SRS and HFSR due to the treatment selection. However, no significant differences were observed in the actuarial rates of obliteration and transient increased signals with T2-weighted MR images between SRS and HFSR. Radiation necrosis occurred in two patients treated with SRS and in none with HFSR. Intracranial hemorrhage after treatment happened in two treated with SRS and three with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: HFSR appears to be at least as effective as SRS in achieving complete obliteration of intracranial AVM, although its definitive role remains to be investigated

The target is fixed to the rotational isocenter of a Varian 4 MV linear accelerator. The first irradiation is carried out while the radiating source is rotating on a 100-140 degrees arc. The patient is then rotated around a vertical axis passing through the target, and arc irradiations are repeated in different angular positions. By this technique it is possible to obtain very steep dose gradients at the borders of the target volume. High doses are usually delivered in two shots. 47 patients have been treated so far in a clinical trial that started in November 1982. The paper deals with the preliminary results (more than 6 months' follow-up) obtained in patients affected by nonresectable brain tumors and AVMs

There is no consensus among neurosurgeons as to the best device (gamma knife, linear accelerator), the treatment doses, and the clinical indications of stereotactic radiosurgery. Therefore, this report is the viewpoint of one neurosurgical team only. In the radiosurgery literature, there is no clear evidence of better results with the gamma-knife or the linear accelerators. With regard to clinical applications, cerebral arteriovenous malformations are the more widely accepted indications of radiosurgery, since a cerebral angiography can confirm the disappearance of the nidus of an arteriovenous malformation treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Usually, small and deep arteriovenous malformations can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery only. Nevertheless, the treatment of the other arteriovenous malformations more often require procedures including one or several of the following treatment methods: microneurosurgery, interventional neuradiology, stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery in acoustic schwannomas, skull base meningiomas, especially those involving the cavernous sinus, brain metastases, and pituitary tumors seem attractive. Contrary to arteriovenous malformations, the lack of criteria for cure requires a long follow-up and carefully controlled trials to confirm the efficiency of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors. On the other hand, experience of stereotactic radiosurgery for astrocytomas and glioblastomas is limited, and few publications are available. Furthermore, because of the infiltrating growth, a major impact of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors is presumably not to be expected. Lastly, a close multidisciplinary approach seems absolutely necessary to define the best indications of stereotactic radiosurgery and to improve its clinical results

To revisit the mechanism of carcinogenesis by Thorotrast (THR), we examined the tissue distribution of THR granules and two-dimensional distribution of radioactivity in the organs of Thorotrastosis patients and studied their spatial relationship to histopathological changes. The high radioactivity in the patients' organ was predominantly derived from decay of Thorium series and showed unique distribution, while the far lower natural radioactivity was mainly from Uranium series decay and fairly evenly distributed. It was found that a large majority of THR granules were phagocytized by macrophages and were embedded in extensive fibrosis. Cancer was rarely in the center of THR deposition but rather at a distance from the deposits. These observations may indicate that the predominant feature of THR deposition is the tissue damage by direct hit of alpha-particles and subsequent fibrosis. The effect of THR resembles action of toxic chemical agents, as several authors have pointed out. We therefore assume that carcinogenesis in Thorotrastosis is a combination of events, such as regeneration of liver tissue after radiation damage, emission of secondary electrons, ionization of the surrounding tissue, and beta- or gamma-ray from daughter nuclei of Thorium (Th). In this context, the role of alpha-particle is important but more intriguing

The lymphocyte count was reduced to approximately 40 per cent at termination of treatment and remained below the pre-treatment level during a follow-up period of 18 months. The relative spontaneous cytotoxicity for 51Cr-labelled K562 cells, derived from a human myeloid leukemia, increased at completion of irradiation and remained elevated during the entire observation period. The relative cytotoxicity against Chang cells, derived from human liver, also seemed to increase but not to the same extent. The increments were probably due to an increased proportion of spontaneously cytotoxic cells bearing Fc-receptors for IgG which were significantly elevated after treatment. It was concluded that the changes differ from those occurring after local irradiation for breast carcinoma. The proportion of lymphoid tissue in relation to the blood volume which is included in the irradiated field may determine the changes of the blood lymphocyte population

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that in paediatric cancers, proton beams are of potential importance in 80-100 children annually in Sweden. About 20 of the patients have medulloblastoma. The main purpose is to reduce late sequelae, but these are also increased chances to avoid myelosupression during e.g. concomitant chemo-radiation and to further intensify the chemotherapy.

They emphasize the role of promotion, in particular that associated with cell proliferation. There is therefore a qualitative difference between high doses of genotoxic agents which provoke cell death and a compensatory increase in cell division, and low doses which do not. During the promotion phase, human data demonstrate the importance of induced genetic instability and defects in apoptosis as well as that of cell immortalization which play a main role for the accumulation in a cell genome of several specific lesions. Carcinogenesis is a complex process in which initial mutations do not appear to be a limiting or crucial step. This view is supported by the paramount influence of age on the induction by radiation of thyroid and breast cancer. It is also compatible with practical thresholds observed in subjects whose bones or liver were exposed to alpha-emitters, as well as with the curvilinearity in the leukemia incidence dose-response in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The linear no threshold model assumes that: 1) the probability of DNA lesion repair is constant whatever the dose and, hence, the number of lesions provoked in the same cell and the surrounding cells; 2) the probability for a damaged cell to evolve toward an invasive cancer is not influenced by the possible promotional effect of further irradiation or induced tissue proliferation, nor the control exerted by surrounding cells. These assumptions deserve a critical analysis. [References: 80]

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigated 106 tumors (27 ciliary body melanomas and 79 choroidal-ciliary melanomas) of patients treated between June 1983 and April 1998. Seventy-two patients were treated with 106-ruthenium applicators and 34 were treated with proton therapy. Some large tumors or recurrences required a second treatment. The mean follow-up period was 91 months. RESULTS: The mean tumor sizes before treatment were 6,6mm for melanoma thickness and 10.3mm for mean largest basal melanoma diameters (LTD). Of the patients studied, 71% were still alive at 5 years, 35% had metastasis and 27.7% developed recurrences. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for melanoma-related death were LTD greater than 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis, and choroidal-ciliary location. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With 71% of patients still alive at 5 years, this review shows that melanomas involving the ciliary body do not seem less severe than more posterior uveal tumors. Because of size differences between ciliary body melanomas and choroidal-ciliary melanomas, we cannot come to the conclusion that choroidal-ciliary melanomas have a poorer prognosis than ciliary body melanomas. Largest tumor diameter over 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, and macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis are important risk factors for melanoma-related death, as shown by the multivariate analysis

1	1766	A tool to measure radiotherapy complexity and workload: derivation from the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) concept.[see comment]	Efficiency,Organizational, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Time, Time Management, Workload	Radiotherapy workload is poorly represented by simple parameters of patients, fractions or fields treated because these do not contain any measure of treatment complexity. However, complexity is increasing and there is an urgent need to quantify this. We have evaluated the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) model as a measure of radiotherapy workload and complexity. Radiotherapy treatment times, from the patient entering to exiting the treatment room maze, were measured for 1298 treatment sessions on 269 patients. The data were used to assess the original model and derive three new models for predicting treatment duration. The most complicated, the 'Addenbrooke's complex model', contained two additional predictor variables, including 'site/technique', in a linear additive form. Before the study, the department used a standard treatment appointment time of 10 minutes. However, 50% of the measured treatments took longer than 10 minutes, (mean 10.9). Summed over the working day, this discrepancy indicates that a standard 10-minute appointment is a poor basis for scheduling radiotherapy. The original BTE model was effective in predicting treatment times, although this was improved by refinement of the model. The Addenbrooke's complex model correctly predicted 70% of treatment times to within 2 minutes (55% for the original BTE model), 80% to within 2.5 minutes and 95% to within 4.7 minutes. The percentage of the variation in observed times accounted for by the model is 59.4%. The models can represent radiotherapy complexity, can improve scheduling on linear accelerators, and are likely to be applicable to other departments. They are thus tools to assess the impact of changes in complexity from new techniques, trial protocols (e.g. the Medical Research Council prostate radiotherapy trial RTO1), and possible time saving from advanced technology such as multileaf collimators (MLCs) or automated machine set-up. The replacement of manually-lifted shielding blocks by MLCs should save 1.1-1.5 minutes for a three- or four-field pelvic plan (i.e. 12%-13%).

However, complexity is increasing and there is an urgent need to quantify this. We have evaluated the basic treatment equivalent (BTE) model as a measure of radiotherapy workload and complexity. Radiotherapy treatment times, from the patient entering to exiting the treatment room maze, were measured for 1298 treatment sessions on 269 patients. The data were used to assess the original model and derive three new models for predicting treatment duration. The most complicated, the 'Addenbrooke's complex model', contained two additional predictor variables, including 'site/technique', in a linear additive form. Before the study, the department used a standard treatment appointment time of 10 minutes. However, 50% of the measured treatments took longer than 10 minutes, (mean 10.9). Summed over the working day, this discrepancy indicates that a standard 10-minute appointment is a poor basis for scheduling radiotherapy. The original BTE model was effective in predicting treatment times, although this was improved by refinement of the model. The Addenbrooke's complex model correctly predicted 70% of treatment times to within 2 minutes (55% for the original BTE model), 80% to within 2.5 minutes and 95% to within 4.7 minutes. The percentage of the variation in observed times accounted for by the model is 59.4%. The models can represent radiotherapy complexity, can improve scheduling on linear accelerators, and are likely to be applicable to other departments. They are thus tools to assess the impact of changes in complexity from new techniques, trial protocols (e.g. the Medical Research Council prostate radiotherapy trial RTO1), and possible time saving from advanced technology such as multileaf collimators (MLCs) or automated machine set-up. The replacement of manually-lifted shielding blocks by MLCs should save 1.1-1.5 minutes for a three- or four-field pelvic plan (i.e. 12%-13%). The models could also be used to aid planning for future linear accelerator provision and for costing radiotherapy treatment

The main causes of failure remain linked to locoregional recurrences, which are due to incomplete eradication of clonogenic cells. Conventional radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy are currently carried out at their extreme possibilities due to their intrinsic limitation--namely the impossibility to generate concave dose distributions without compromising tumor irradiation. Approximately a third of patients treated with radiotherapy and most head and neck cancer cases present concave shapes of the target volumes. With the advent of intensity modulated radiation therapy--clinically available for only few years--head and neck patients can now benefit from strategies based on highly conformal techniques. It is possible to exploit efficiently dose-escalation protocols to increase probabilities to eradicate clonogens, to reduce overall treatment time, to control repopulation problems and to keep as low as reasonably necessary the irradiation of healthy tissues minimizing acute and late complications. Today, both planning and clinical studies demonstrate these advantages but larger controlled trials are necessary to assess the true potentialities of techniques based on intensity modulation for head and neck cancers. In a speculative view, proton therapy, possibly with intensity modulation, or light ion therapy should be considered for selected cases or for reirradiation due to their higher biological efficacy and their degree of dose-conformation to target volumes.

DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and December 2001, 74 patients were treated for chordomas and chondrosarcomas with carbon ion RT at the "Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung" (GSI). Seven patients reirradiated with reduced carbon ion doses after conventional RT were excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 evaluable patients (44 chordomas and 23 chondrosarcomas) who received a full course of carbon ion therapy. Tumor-conform application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with active energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included intensity modulation and biological plan optimization. A median dose of 60 GyE was applied to the target volume within 20 consecutive days at a dose of 3.0 GyE per fraction. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-46 months). At 3 years, actuarial local control was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 87% for chordomas, respectively. Partial tumor remission was observed in 14/44 (31%) chordoma patients and in 4/23 (17%) chondrosarcoma patients. At 3 years, actuarial overall survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 89% for chordomas, respectively. No severe side effects > CTC degrees III have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the clinical efficiency and safety of scanning beam delivery of carbon ion beams in patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and December 2001, 74 patients were treated for chordomas and chondrosarcomas with carbon ion RT at the "Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung" (GSI). Seven patients reirradiated with reduced carbon ion doses after conventional RT were excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 evaluable patients (44 chordomas and 23 chondrosarcomas) who received a full course of carbon ion therapy. Tumor-conform application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with active energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included intensity modulation and biological plan optimization. A median dose of 60 GyE was applied to the target volume within 20 consecutive days at a dose of 3.0 GyE per fraction. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-46 months). At 3 years, actuarial local control was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 87% for chordomas, respectively. Partial tumor remission was observed in 14/44 (31%) chordoma patients and in 4/23 (17%) chondrosarcoma patients. At 3 years, actuarial overall survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 89% for chordomas, respectively. No severe side effects > CTC degrees III have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the clinical efficiency and safety of scanning beam delivery of carbon ion beams in patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. The observation of tumor regressions at a dose level of 60 GyE may indicate that the biological effectiveness of carbon ions in chordomas and chondrosarcomas is higher than initially estimated

0	847	Light ion facility projects in Europe: methodological aspects for the calculation of the treatment cost per protocol	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Europe, France, Health Care Costs, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Light, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Research	In the framework of the European Network for Research in Light Ion Hadron Therapy (ENLIGHT), the health economics group develops a methodology for assessing important investment and operating costs of this innovative treatment against its expected benefits. The main task is to estimate the cost per treated patient. The cost analysis is restricted to the therapeutic phase from the hospital point of view. An original methodology for cost assessment per treatment protocol is developed based on standard costs. Costs related to direct medical activity are based on the production process analysis, whereas indirect and non direct medical costs are allocated to each protocol using relevant cost-drivers. The resulting cost model will take into account the specificities of each therapeutic protocol as well as the particularities of each of the European projects

1	2516	15 years experience with helium ion radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Survival, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To review the long-term experience of helium ion therapy as a therapeutic alternative to enucleation for uveal melanoma, particularly with respect to survival, local control, and morbidity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)

METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects with subfoveal CNVM due to AMD were randomly assigned to 16-Gy proton irradiation delivered in two fractions 24 hours apart or to sham control treatment. Recruitment was halted at 37 subjects for ethical reasons regarding randomization to sham treatment when Food and Drug Administration approval of Visudyne was anticipated. RESULTS: Proton irradiation was associated with a trend toward stabilization of visual acuity, but this association did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found within the fluorescein angiography data, including greatest linear dimension of CNVM total size, area of active leakage, area of associated subretinal hemorrhage, and intensity. CONCLUSIONS: With the acceptance of photodynamic therapy, future studies will require more complex design and larger sample size to determine whether radiation can play either a primary or adjunctive role in treating these lesions

METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects with subfoveal CNVM due to AMD were randomly assigned to 16-Gy proton irradiation delivered in two fractions 24 hours apart or to sham control treatment. Recruitment was halted at 37 subjects for ethical reasons regarding randomization to sham treatment when Food and Drug Administration approval of Visudyne was anticipated. RESULTS: Proton irradiation was associated with a trend toward stabilization of visual acuity, but this association did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found within the fluorescein angiography data, including greatest linear dimension of CNVM total size, area of active leakage, area of associated subretinal hemorrhage, and intensity.

Chordomas are uncommon primary malignant tumors of bone that typically occur in the axial skeleton including the sacrum, vertebrae, and skull base. The base of skull tumors usually are not amenable to complete surgical resection, and most require postoperative radiotherapy. The natural history of skull base chordoma is typified by slow locally invasive tumor progression and eventual death, although few parameters are known that allow stratification of patients into prognostic groups. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with skull base chordomas treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital by proton beam irradiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up information were reviewed in an attempt to identify clinical and pathologic parameters that predicted outcome. RESULTS. Female sex, tumor necrosis in preradiation treatment biopsy, and tumor volume in excess of 70 ml were each independent predictors of shortened overall survival after radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. CONCLUSIONS. Stratification of patients with skull base chordoma into poor and good outcome groups can be performed using the three parameters identified in our study. In addition, the striking difference in survival between the sexes suggests that further investigations of these tumors should include determination of their hormonal receptors status and consideration of hormonal manipulation in their management

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

Through experience we know that naturally aged ones have higher metabolism than the non-aged ones. Also, the same effect as natural aging can be obtained in various types of spirits or wines by the treatment for a period of time with soft ultrasonic wave (US). In this study, we compared ethanol metabolism in human subjects dosed with non-treated white wine (control = CON) and with US treated wine. Ethanol levels in human sera were followed by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy after administration of wine doses. Experimental results indicated that ethanol metabolism was enhanced 18% in subjects when US treated wine was used rather than when non-treated (CON) was used. Other experiments using rabbits showed that a 20% ethanol-aqueous solution was absorbed 18% more rapidly by the group dosed with US wine than by the CON group. From these experimental facts, it was theorized that ethanol metabolism depends on the rapidity of ethanol absorption in the human body. And it can be concluded that US treatment brings about the same effect on spirits or wines as natural aging

Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages

Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages

The study was designed to serve as a cytogenetic analysis along with the therapeutic procedure of ankylosing spondylitis patients who were undergoing a treatment with (224)Ra-chloride. The total administered activity was 10 MBq, and the treatment followed a schedule of 10 i.v. injections per week, each with a dose of 1 MBq of (224)Ra. The calculation of absorbed doses delivered to the blood used the models suggested by the ICRP and yielded a value of 4.7 mGy/MBq. The frequency of chromosomal aberrations observed during the course of therapy was related to the blood dose. The frequency of dicentric chromosomes induced in vivo was found to agree well with the corresponding value of dicentrics induced in vitro. However--given that peripheral lymphocytes are in the cell cycle's G(0) stage--an unexpected increase with dose in the yield of chromatid breaks was observed, with about 95% of them occurring in cells without any other chromosome-type aberrations. Reasons for the production of chromatid breaks are discussed

Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 55 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated between 2001 and 2005 with C-ion RT based on computed tomography treatment planning. All patients had a tumor of large size or one located close to the optic disk. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of NVG for the following parameters; gender, age, dose-volumes of the iris-ciliary body and the wall of eyeball, and irradiation of the optic disk (ODI). RESULTS: Neovascular glaucoma occurred in 23 patients and the 3-year cumulative NVG rate was 42.6 +/- 6.8% (standard error), but enucleation from NVG was performed in only three eyes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant risk factors for NVG were V50IC (volume irradiated > or =50 GyE to iris-ciliary body) (p = 0.002) and ODI (p = 0.036). The 3-year NVG rate for patients with V50IC > or =0.127 mL and those with V50IC <0.127 mL were 71.4 +/- 8.5% and 11.5 +/- 6.3%, respectively. The corresponding rate for the patients with and without ODI were 62.9 +/- 10.4% and 28.4 +/- 8.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dose-volume histogram analysis with computed tomography indicated that V50IC and ODI were independent risk factors for NVG. An irradiation system that can reduce the dose to both the anterior segment and the optic disk might be worth adopting to investigate whether or not incidence of NVG can be decreased with it

Radiation therapy has been advocated when the location of the lung cancer precludes resection or the severity or the cardiopulmonary impairment indicates that the patient cannot withstand the proposed resection. Extended field irradiation has been shown to improve tumor control and survival. However, in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, extended field irradiation may exacerbate pulmonary insufficiency and compromise survival. Between 1975 and 1980, 29 patients with lung cancer and chronic pulmonary disease were treated by involved field irradiation (IFR). This was compared to the experience of 41 patients who had been treated prior to 1975 by extended field irradiation (EFR). The frequency of subjective response and tumor control were comparable in each group. One patient treated by IFR developed a marginal recurrence. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 7/41 (17%) EFR patients versus 2/29 (7%) IFR. Treatment related death occurred in 2/41 (5%) EFR versus 1/29 (3.3%) IFR. One year disease free survival was 8/41 (19%) EFR versus 12/29 (41%) IFR. Two of 14 (14%) IFR patients at risk five years are alive without evidence of disease

The patient lies on a low couch and receives exposure in the prone and supine positions from a modulated arcing beam. The technique has been validated using a personal computer to control the linear accelerator and we demonstrate that only minor alterations to current dynamic therapy systems would be required. We have examined the practical application of this treatment with emphasis on methods of conformal therapy where an optimized dose distribution is prepared from a matrix of caliper measurements taken from the patient. This technique provides a means for regular TBI treatment on a computer-controlled linear accelerator that is easy to set up, requires short exposure times and is comfortable for the patient

1	2906	Proton irradiation of small choroidal malignant melanomas	Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Nuclear Energy, Ophthalmoscopy, Protons, Radiography, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Sclera, Tantalum, Transillumination	Five patients with choroidal malignant melanomas were treated with proton irradiation with a cyclotron. We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary treatment costs and costs for recurrent tumors are estimated. The costs for treatment of recurrent tumors were estimated using a sample of 10 patients presenting with recurrent chordoma at the base of skull at DKFZ. Using various scenarios for the local control rate and reimbursements of Carbon ion therapy the cost-effectiveness of ion therapy for these tumors is analyzed. RESULTS: If local control rate for skull base chordoma achieved with carbon ion therapy exceeds 70.3%, the overall treatment costs for carbon RT are lower than for conventional RTI. The cost-effectiveness ratio for carbon RT is 2539 Euro per 1% increase in survival, or 7692 Euro per additional life year. CONCLUSION: Current results support the thesis that Carbon ion RT, although more expensive, is at least as cost-effective as advanced photon therapies for these patients. Ion RT, however, offers substantial benefits for the patients such as improved control rates and less severe side effects. [References: 18]

[Review] [12 refs] [Japanese]	Cancer Care Facilities, Gamma Rays, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Relative Biological Effectiveness, X-Rays	Proton therapy delivers a conformed dose to the tumor, while reducing the dose to the surrounding tissues. Its relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is similar to that of conventional radiation, such as X-rays and gamma-rays. Proton therapy was first applied to humans in 1954. Thus for more than 19,000 patients have been treated. The distribution of the diseases to which it has been applied, however, has been quite limited. Although it is now performed at 17 institutions throughout the world, a hospital-based medically dedicated proton therapy system exists at only one institution. Therefore, proton therapy is considered to be an experimental treatment for most malignant diseases, and its equipment is also considered to be underdevelopment situation. In this paper, the project of proton treatment facility at the National Cancer Center (NCC, Kashiwa) is presented. Problems and future direction of our project are also discussed in this article.

Individual proton spectra from the 3-D array of spectra encompassing the lesion showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation necrosis, recurrent or residual tumor, or normal brain. The 1H-MRS imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or recurrent tumor and contrast-enhancing radiation-induced necrosis. Regions of abnormally high choline (Cho) levels, consistent with viable tumor, were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 gliomas. Changes in the serial 1H-MRS imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following treatment. These changes included the significant reduction in Cho levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to necrotic tissue. For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical progression, an increase in Cho levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or necrotic. Several patients showed regional variations in response to brachytherapy as evaluated by 1H-MRS imaging. This study demonstrates the potential of noninvasive 3-D 1H-MRS imaging to discriminate between the formation of contrast-enhancing radiation necrosis and residual or recurrent tumor following brachytherapy. This modality may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to brachytherapy by detecting the presence of abnormnal metabolite levels in nonenhancing regions of solid tumor

For intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the "hand calculation" becomes not feasible due to the sophisticated multileaf collimator (MLC) segments created for intensity-modulated dose delivery. Therefore, an independent computerized dose calculation routine is needed for fast and reliable dose verification. In this work, a point dose calculation routine for IMRS/IMRT plan verification is developed by directly applying Clarkson's method. The method includes preparing data table by measuring TPRs for circular fields with diameters ranging 6 to 98 mm, extrapolating TPR for the zero field size (TPR0) from measured data and generating scatter phantom ratio (SPR) for each individual circular field. The segmented MLC sequences created by IMRS/IMRT inverse planning are converted into irregular fields for Clarkson's calculation. This method has been tested using 29 IMRS/IMRT cases. The results indicate that it is reliable, fast, and accurate. The average time to calculate one field is about 2 s with a 300 Mhz CPU

This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

Technical considerations and results	Aged, Ascites/et [Etiology], Ascites/pc [Prevention & Control], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence/pc [Prevention & Control], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To present technical considerations and results of proton irradiation in a single fraction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with uncontrollable ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy. Further studies should be performed to determine whether TTT could be beneficial to smaller tumours and to define its optimal dose. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel

Since July 1983, 57 patients with surgically inaccessible AOVMs of the brain were treated using helium ion (47 patients) or linear accelerator (10 patients) radiosurgery. This study retrospectively evaluates the response of these AOVMs to treatment. METHODS: All patients presented with previous hemorrhage. The mean patient age was 35.6 years (range, 13-71 yr). The mean AOVM volume was 2.25 cm3 (range, 0.080-15.2 cm3), treated with a mean of 18.0 Gy equivalent (physical dose x relative biological effectiveness, which is 1.3 for helium ion Bragg peak) (range, 7.0-40 Gy equivalent). The Drake scale scores before treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (26 patients), and poor (6 patients). The mean follow-up period was 7.5 years (range, 9 mo-13.8 yr). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (32%) bled symptomatically (20 hemorrhages) after radiosurgery. Sixteen hemorrhages occurred within 36 months after radiosurgery (9.4% annual bleed rate; 16 hemorrhages/171 patient yr); 4 hemorrhages occurred more than 36 months after treatment (1.6% annual bleed rate; 4 hemorrhages/257 patient yr) (P < 0.001). Complications included symptomatic radiation edema (four patients, 7%), necrosis (one patient, 2%), and increased seizure frequency (one patient, 2%). Eight patients underwent surgical resection of their AOVMs 8 to 59 months after radiosurgery because of subsequent hemorrhage. The Drake scale scores after treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (24 patients), poor (3 patients), and dead (5 patients, 3 of whom died as a result of causes unrelated to the AOVMs or radiosurgery). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery may be useful for AOVMs located in surgically inaccessible regions of the brain. A significant decrease in bleed rate exists more than 3 years after treatment compared with the bleed rate within 3 years of treatment. Because current neuroradiological techniques are not able to image obliterative response in these slow-flow vascular lesions, longer term clinical follow-up is required

The local disease was controlled in 111 of these patients. This study reviews the 26 patients who have had their disease recur, and who have evaluable diagnostic studies to examine for probable causes of recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The histologies of the recurrent tumors were 21 non-chondroid chordomas, two chondroid chordomas, and three chondrosarcomas. The prescribed doses ranged from 67 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 72 CGE (average of 69 CGE). Doses to small regions of the tumor were deliberately reduced where they abutted certain normal tissues (brain stem, spinal cord, optic chiasm, and optic nerves) in order to keep these structures at acceptance dose levels. The first study, CT or MR scan, on which there was evidence of increase in tumor was carefully evaluated and that volume transferred to the CT scan on which the treatment plan had been developed. The 3D dose distribution in the region of recurrence was carefully analyzed and a judgement made as to the most probable cause of recurrence. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter (6 of 26) of the cases failed in the prescribed dose region. More than half (15 of 26) failed in regions where tumor dose was limited by normal tissue constraints. Approximately 10% of the patients recurred in the surgical pathway and 10% were judged to be marginal misses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 75% of the patients failed in regions receiving less than the prescribed dose. All tumors which failed in the high dose region had volume greater than 75 cc. Patients with cervical spine disease had a higher rate of recurrence (10 or 26) and larger tumors (average volume of 102 cc) than those with base of skull disease (16 of 115) with an average volume of 63 cc

The first study, CT or MR scan, on which there was evidence of increase in tumor was carefully evaluated and that volume transferred to the CT scan on which the treatment plan had been developed. The 3D dose distribution in the region of recurrence was carefully analyzed and a judgement made as to the most probable cause of recurrence. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter (6 of 26) of the cases failed in the prescribed dose region. More than half (15 of 26) failed in regions where tumor dose was limited by normal tissue constraints. Approximately 10% of the patients recurred in the surgical pathway and 10% were judged to be marginal misses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 75% of the patients failed in regions receiving less than the prescribed dose. All tumors which failed in the high dose region had volume greater than 75 cc. Patients with cervical spine disease had a higher rate of recurrence (10 or 26) and larger tumors (average volume of 102 cc) than those with base of skull disease (16 of 115) with an average volume of 63 cc

Previously, the only treatment that could halt progression of this disease was laser photocoagulation, which was, however, accompanied by immediate reduction in visual acuity. A single narrow proton beam was used to irradiate 45 patients to either 8 or 14 Cobalt Gray Equivalent. The alignment technique and dosimetry of these treatments are described. The proton beam direction, range, and modulation were planned with the assistance of an eye-specific planning program. A single anterior beam was used, with patients looking nasally toward a blinking fixation light at an angle of 30 degrees. Patients were aligned using a light field projected through a slit collimator. Patients' positions were monitored during treatment with a short-focal-length camera. Depth dose in a flat phantom was measured with a small-diameter parallel plate ionization chamber. Lateral profiles were measured at several depths with silver halide film. Each treatment session lasted 15 min, of which 1 min consisted of beam delivery. The proton beam stopped in the orbital cavity, delivering no primary proton dose to the brain. Dose to the center of the lens of the involved eye was less than 0.5% of the dose delivered to the macula. Treatments of SNVMs with proton beams require only a short visit to the hospital, little immobilization effort, and a minimal amount of treatment room and beam time. Compared to previous treatment trials using x-ray beams, the dose to nonocular tissues is reduced significantly

0	1751	Induction and rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks in normal human skin fibroblasts after exposure to radiation of different linear energy transfer: possible roles of track structure and chromatin organization	Chromatin/ch [Chemistry], DNA Damage, DNA Fragmentation, DNA/ch [Chemistry], DNA/me [Metabolism], DNA/re [Radiation Effects], Energy Transfer, Fibroblasts, Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Ions, Kinetics, Linear Energy Transfer, Nitrogen, Protein Conformation, Radiation, Research, Skin/cy [Cytology], Skin/me [Metabolism], Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Sweden, Universities	DNA double-strand breaks are nonrandomly induced by high-LET radiation. Differences in the induction and rejoining of DSBs after irradiation with ions having different LET were detected by fragment analysis. The data obtained indicate that the track structure of the traversing particle and its interaction with the different chromatin structures of the cellular DNA influence the yield as well as the distribution of the induced damage. The induction and rejoining of clustered DSBs induced by the same nitrogen ion fluence at LETs of 80-225 keV/microm were investigated by a detailed analysis of the DNA fragmentation patterns in normal human fibroblasts. The DSBs in the cells were allowed to rejoin during incubations for 0-20 h. Two separate pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols were used, optimized for separation of fragments in the size ranges 1-6 Mbp and 5 kbp-1.5 Mbp. A strong influence of LET on the level of DSB induction was evident. The DSB yield increased from 4.5 +/- 0.2 to 10.0 +/- 0.3 DSBs per particle traversal through the cell nucleus when LET increased from 80 to 225 keV/microm. Further, the size distribution of the DNA fragments showed a significant dependence on radiation quality, with an excess of fragments at 50-200 kbp and around 1 Mbp. Differences in repair kinetics were also evident, with slower rejoining for increasing LET, and the initial nonrandom fragment distributions were still present after 1 h of repair

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

In the United States, POHS is an important cause of loss of central visual acuity in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years. A number of treatment options for subfoveal and juxtafoveal CNVMs in POHS have been under investigation, including laser photocoagulation, surgical excision of the CNVM, and radiation therapy. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old women was referred to our office reporting decreased depth perception and finger-counting vision in the right eye for the duration of 1 month. A diagnosis of POHS with subfoveal CNVM was made and the patient was referred for an experimental protocol of proton-beam irradiation. Four months after her initial visit, the patient returned, reporting blurry vision with a blind spot in her left eye. A subfoveal CNVM in the left eye was subsequently treated with irradiation as well. Seven months after the initial treatment, visual acuities were 20/20 in each treated eye. CONCLUSION: Although is currently an experimental procedure, proton-beam irradiation appears to be a promising treatment for subfoveal CNVM in patients with POHS

[Japanese]	Brachytherapy, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Informed Consent, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Male, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Quality of Life, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Relative Biological Effectiveness	Radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer has been developing dramatically during the past 10 years in Japan as well as in USA. There are several ways to treat prostate cancer by RT. As for external-beam RT (EBRT), a more sophisticated technique beyond 3-dimensional conformal RT called intensity modulated RT was developed and has been in use in many Japanese RT centers. It can raise the total radiation dose and is expected to increase the biochemical control rate. As for brachytherapy, a low-dose-rate seed implant using iodine-125 was initiated in 2003 and has become widespread throughout Japan in only a few years. High-dose-rate brachytherapy using iridium-19 2 has also been used in more advanced cases combined with EBRT. Brachytherapy offers an ideal RT dose concentration and can avoid rectal complications. As for particle therapy, we have carbon and proton in several institutions in Japan. Particles have the merit of good dose distributions and for carbons, relative biological effectiveness. Furthermore, some centers are considering the stereotactic hypofractionated RT due to the relatively low alfa-beta ratio of prostate cancer. Recent reports showed that after a certain period of followup, the biochemical control rate was similar either with external beam high-quality RT, brachytherapy, heavy ion RT and surgery. Therefore, the choice of treatment should depend on the adverse effects, quality of life, medical costs, and the lifestyle of the patient. The merits and demerits of each treatment modality were discussed. Longer follow-up is still necessary and informed consent is mandatory when choosing a treatment modality

Longterm follow-up after conventional high voltage radiation in 17 patients and proton therapy in 13 patients confirmed a similar reduction of GH levels in both groups. After 4.5 years a decrease of about 80% was achieved. After "conventional radiation" GH was normal in 8 (47%) and near normal in 6 (35%) while proton therapy resulted in normalization in 5 and improvement in 5 (38%). The slightly better results of "conventional radiation" must be attributed to lower pretreatment levels of GH. Side effects as additional pituitary deficits and oculomotor palsies were more often seen after proton treatment. Since the results of both radiation methods are similar and proton therapy has a tendency to more serious side effects we recommend "conventional radiation" as secondary treatment of acromegaly

[Review] [28 refs]	Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/th [Therapy], Humans, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Base Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Our purpose was to discuss the optimal treatment and outcomes for patients with skull base chordomas. METHODS: We reviewed the pertinent literature for this study. RESULTS: Skull base chordomas usually arise in the clivus and are rarely completely resectable. Therefore, most are treated with radiotherapy (RT). Because of the risk of severe late complications, the dose is often limited with conventional photon RT, and the probability of cure is low. Proton RT alone or combined with photon RT (proton/photon RT) offers the advantage of improved dose distribution and the ability to treat the tumor to a higher dose without exceeding normal tissue tolerance. The 10-year local control rate after proton/photon RT is approximately 40% to 50%. The probability of local control is related to minimum tumor dose and dose inhomogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Skull base chordoma is a rare neoplasm that is rarely cured after surgery alone or combined with conventional RT. Proton/photon RT offers the advantage of increasing the tumor dose while minimizing the dose to normal tissues, thus reducing the risk of late complications. The optimal treatment may be photon/proton RT alone or combined with a gross total resection, when feasible. 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. [References: 28]

0	3407	Influence of microdosimetric quantities on observed dose-response relationships in radiation therapy	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Photons, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Sweden, Weights and Measures	The steepness of dose-response curves in radiation therapy depends to a large extent on the statistics of cell killing. This is so if the last few clonogenic tumor cells have to be hit or eradicated by other means to cure the patient. The steepness is dependent on the number of clonogenic cells in the tumor and the possible variation in their sensitivity. However, the uniformity of the dose distribution is also important and a decreased slope may result when the delivery of the dose is nonuniform or statistically uncertain. The variance in the energy imparted at the microdosimetric level to individual cell nuclei constitutes the ultimate limit of the variance in delivered dose at a given mean tumor dose. Considering all dosimetric variances it is shown that for low-LET beams the conventional microdosimetric variance will dominate, while in neutron and high-LET beams in general the microdosimetric variance may contribute significantly to the observed dose-response relationship. As a result the normalized slope of the dose-response curve for tumor control and normal tissue complications with neutrons and other high-LET beams will be reduced compared to that with photons. This conclusion is found to be in quantitative agreement with available data from clinical trials with neutron therapy. Finally, it is pointed out that for beams with a very high RBE and LET it may be favorable to deliver a fraction of the total dose in the form of conventional low-LET radiation. This addition of low-LET radiation may be desirable to ensure a dose to all clonogenic tumor cell nuclei that is sufficiently high and uniform to achieve a high probability of tumor control

Doses to radiopharmacy and medical staff have been measured both in normal work and in some handling incidents. Data on radiation levels in the installation have also been obtained and related to design details and shielding. Area dosimetry was carried out using a five-stationary detector network, with a sampling rate of 2 min(-1), and by thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD). Staff were also monitored by TLD, using extra chips for finger dosimetry and to duplicate individual whole-body dosimetry in order to measure doses in certain single operations. For normal work, average whole-body doses to radiopharmacy staff were between 0.03 and 0.28 mSv/month, wrist doses were between 0.42 and 2.67 mSv/month, and finger doses were between 1.4 and 7.7 mSv/day for the left hand and 0.8 and 2.4 mSv/day for the right hand; such variation reflects the differing expertise of staff and the role played by optimisation. Finger doses between 16 and 131 mSv were measured in handling incidents, and finger doses of 20.2 and 20.7 mSv for the left hand and 22.0 and 22.3 mSv for the right hand were measured during handling of a syringe without shielding, containing 3 GBq. For medical staff, contributions to the whole-body dose of 2.0 and 1.9 microSv/procedure were measured for injection and placing the patient on the examination couch, respectively. Dose measurement on the middle finger of the right hand gives an average of 70 microSv during the injection. The provisions regarding the shielding design have proved to be adequate and effective during a 3-year operational period. Operational doses to medical staff are comparatively low, while radiopharmacy staff are the most exposed. The finger doses in these professionals may exceed the annual limit, unless operational restrictions in daily practice are adopted. On-line area dosimetry records based on dose rate probes have proved to be effective both for monitoring radiation levels during the operation and for detecting changes in the behaviour of the facility in the irradiation process

The first group consisting of 19 patients was submitted to a combined percutaneous and interstitial treatment, the other six patients were initially treated only by interstitial therapy because of severe complications observed in the meantime. After bilateral pelvic staging lymphadenectomy, permanent iodine-125 seeds were implanted into the patients of stage T1, T2, early T3, and pN0-1, in case of microscopic lymph node manifestation without capsular perforation also into patients of stage pN2 and pN4. Eight weeks later the patients received a moving beam irradiation with 10 MV photons at the linear accelerator. The centre of the prostate was faded out by a specially constructed H absorber in such a way that the prescribed target dose of 36 Gy in four weeks to the 90%-isodose was only applied to a spherical surface around the implant. One patient died perioperatively from an embolism due to phlebothrombosis of the thigh. 22 out of the other 24 patients are in complete remission, one patient had a local recurrence in the right seminal vesicle which appeared 28 months after primary therapy, and one patient developed skeletal metastases. The objective side effects and late complications of our combined treatment are considerable with respect to their incidence as well as their severity: a slight or medium radioproctitis was found after a latent period of one to two years in 28% (5/18) of cases, after a latent time of about 1 1/2 to two years another 28% (5/18) developed subsequently to a proctitis an urethral stricture and an ulcer situated on the anterior rectum wall facing the prostate, and four patients presented finally a prostato-rectal fistula

The objective side effects and late complications of our combined treatment are considerable with respect to their incidence as well as their severity: a slight or medium radioproctitis was found after a latent period of one to two years in 28% (5/18) of cases, after a latent time of about 1 1/2 to two years another 28% (5/18) developed subsequently to a proctitis an urethral stricture and an ulcer situated on the anterior rectum wall facing the prostate, and four patients presented finally a prostato-rectal fistula

PATIENTS AND METHOD: 126 eyes of 118 patients (age 55-89 years; mean 74 ys.) were treated. Best distal and near visual acuity was assessed prior to (= initial visual acuity [IVA]) and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after teletherapy. Fluorescein angiography was performed prior to and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after radiation therapy. For analysis patients were divided into different groups by IVA and membrane size. Maximal duration of observation was 36 months. Teletherapy was done by a 9-MeV photon linear accelerator through a lateral port in half-beam technique with a single dose of 2 Gy up to a total dose of 20 Gy within 12 days. RESULTS: No severe negative side effects have been observed. Eight patients reported of epiphora and four patients complained of transient sicca syndrome. Visual acuity decreased more than one line in the group IVA 0.05-0.2. The group IVA 0.3-0.5 remained unchanged for 1 year. We found a tendency for increased visual acuity in group IVA > or = 0.6 for 18 months. After that time both groups showed decreased visual acuity, but all these patients reported of reduced metamorphopsia and increased color and contrast perception. CONCLUSIONS: There is an influence of low dose fractionated percutaneous teletherapy on visual acuity, subfoveal neovascular membranes and metamorphopsia. IVA and duration of anamnesis play an important role. There seems to be no persistent effect; possibly increased dosage will bring a benefit

We have developed a dynamic intravenous coronary angiography (IVCAG) system using synchrotron radiation (SR) and have used it clinically. Four patients suspected of having angina pectoris underwent IVCAG. An SR beam was reflected asymmetrically with a silicon crystal to produce a wide (150 mm x 80 mm) and monochromatic (37 keV) X-ray beam, with an energy level to achieve high sensitivity to the contrast agent. Following an intravenous injection of contrast agent, irradiation was applied for 4 ms periods at 33 ms intervals for dynamic IVCAG at 30 images s-1. Images were acquired with an image intensifier and recorded with a digital fluorography system. The dynamic images permitted clear visualization of the coronary arteries and permitted evaluation of coronary anatomy. Two patients exhibited no stenotic lesions, one patient had a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and the remaining patient had a 25% stenosis at the site of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The total irradiation doses used for IVCAG were less than those for conventional angiography. Dynamic IVCAG can be readily used for the evaluation of coronary arteries

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma

[Russian]	Adolescent, Adult, Arteriovenous Fistula/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Cerebral Arteries, Cerebral Veins, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Protons, Retrospective Studies, Stereotaxic Techniques	The paper is concerned with analysis of angiographic findings on 62 patients with arteriovenous aneurysms (AVA) of the cerebral vessels who received proton beam stereotactic therapy in the period of 1978-1986 depending on an absorbed dose value of an irradiated volume. Proton stereotactic therapy (PST) of brain AVA located deep in the functionally important regions, can be used as an independent radical therapeutic method in such cases including inoperable ones. Complete AVA elimination from the blood flow or considerable reduction of the AVA volume was achieved in 68% of the patients after delivering a dose of approximately 40 Gy, the AVA volume being approximately 30%. Significant (p less than 0.05) correlation of PST results, a dose of irradiation and a value of the AVA irradiated volume was established in the groups with positive results and in the nonresponding groups

Although this tumor is radio-resistant and located in a very radiosensitive organ, a conservative approach using radiotherapy is feasible for small or medium size melanomas. The physical and radiobiological basis of the techniques presently used, brachytherapy and protontherapy, are presented together with the complications inherent to each treatment. Future prospects discussed concern the association of hyperthermia with conventional irradiation and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The relevance of each technique with reference to the size and location of the tumor is discussed. [References: 196]

The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

DESIGN: Systematic literature study. METHOD: Systematic electronic searches were carried out in 12 databases according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, without restriction as to year of publication or study design. Manual searches of bibliographies and journals were also performed. The inclusion criteria were: at least 20 patients and a follow-up of at least 2 years. In addition, experts on the subject were consulted by correspondence for their opinion. RESULTS: The search identified 36 relevant articles on proton therapy and 15 on ion therapy. Based on prospective and retrospective studies, proton irradiation emerged as the treatment of choice for ocular tumours, chordomas and skull-base tumours. For prostate cancer, the results were comparable with the best results of photon therapy. Ion therapy was still in an experimental phase. CONCLUSION: According to the current literature, proton therapy is looked upon as the preferred treatment modality for certain rare tumours, such as ocular tumours, chordoma, and skull-base tumours. However, charged particle therapy as a whole, and especially ion therapy, is not supported as the treatment of choice for cancer by published evidence. Nevertheless, the potential theoretical benefit of this treatment is great. [References: 68]

This study was to analyze long-term treatment efficacy, and relevant factors influencing prognosis of NPC in children. METHODS: From Jan. 1975 to Dec. 1995, 47 children,7-14 years old, with NPC diagnosed by pathology received radiotherapy in our hospital. Radiation doses were 52-74 Gy/6-13 weeks [(64.68+/-5.68) Gy] in nasopharynx, and 46-73 Gy/5-13 weeks [(57.77+/-5.86) Gy] in neck; 21 received 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluoroucil, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) before radiotherapy. Survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and analyzed by log-rank test with SPSS 10.0 software. RESULTS: The 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 47 patients were 72.3%, 53.2%, and 40.4%, respectively. Clinical stage (P=0.046), mode of biopsy (P=0.024), radiation dose in nasopharynx (P=0.049), and short-term efficacy (P=0.005) correlated with prognosis of these patients. The average height of 15 male children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years was (161.5+/-1.23) cm. Among 3 female children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years, 2 had menstruation disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage, mode of biopsy, radiation dose in nasopharynx, short-term efficacy may influence prognosis of NPC in children.

The average height of 15 male children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years was (161.5+/-1.23) cm. Among 3 female children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years, 2 had menstruation disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage, mode of biopsy, radiation dose in nasopharynx, short-term efficacy may influence prognosis of NPC in children. Radiation-induced long-term sequelae of NPC in children should not be overlooked

This study was to analyze long-term treatment efficacy, and relevant factors influencing prognosis of NPC in children. METHODS: From Jan. 1975 to Dec. 1995, 47 children,7-14 years old, with NPC diagnosed by pathology received radiotherapy in our hospital. Radiation doses were 52-74 Gy/6-13 weeks [(64.68+/-5.68) Gy] in nasopharynx, and 46-73 Gy/5-13 weeks [(57.77+/-5.86) Gy] in neck; 21 received 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluoroucil, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) before radiotherapy. Survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and analyzed by log-rank test with SPSS 10.0 software. RESULTS: The 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 47 patients were 72.3%, 53.2%, and 40.4%, respectively. Clinical stage (P=0.046), mode of biopsy (P=0.024), radiation dose in nasopharynx (P=0.049), and short-term efficacy (P=0.005) correlated with prognosis of these patients. The average height of 15 male children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years was (161.5+/-1.23) cm. Among 3 female children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years, 2 had menstruation disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage, mode of biopsy, radiation dose in nasopharynx, short-term efficacy may influence prognosis of NPC in children.

For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended

The aim is to achieve local tumour control while minimizing long-term effects. In the treatment of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) the most important long-term effects are neuropsychological. Elsewhere orthopaedic long-term effects may compromise function or be cosmetically harmful. Proton therapy has the potential for homogeneous irradiation of the target volume while reducing the magnitude and/or extent of the low dose area outside the target volume. This may be clinically relevant for long-term effects in children. Proton radiotherapy has an established role in the treatment of children with chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. Planning studies have demonstrated the potential for improving the therapeutic ratio for radiotherapy for tumours of the central nervous system by achieving a uniform dose within the target volume while minimizing the severity of neuropsychological sequelae. Clinical experience of proton radiotherapy for children remains limited with potential areas for clinical research

METHODS: The authors review the current status of advanced technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. RESULTS: Advances in radiotherapy have resulted in improved treatment for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses modifications in the intensity of the photon-beam from a linear accelerator across the irradiated fields to enhance dose conformation in three dimensions. For proton-beam radiation therapy, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are accelerated in cyclotrons or synchrotrons, extracted, and transported to treatment rooms where the proton beam undergoes a series of modifications that conform the dose in a particular patient to the tumor target. Brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy have generally been used to treat microscopic residual disease in patients with sarcomas. These technologies deliver dose to tumor cells with irradiation of limited volumes of normal tissue. Patients who may benefit from technically advanced radiotherapy include those with skull base and spine/paraspinal sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and retroperitoneal/extremity sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in radiation therapy technology, particularly IMRT, proton-beam or other charged-particle radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and intraoperative radiation therapy, have led to improved treatment for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

Consequently, we might observe liberation of metallic debris and wear. Our purpose is to measure the contamination and the migration of these metallic elements in the surrounding tissues of the implant. Two types of samples have been studied. First type is sample taken on post-mortem tissues around prostheses to study contamination gradients. Second type is sample taken on pathologic joints on periprosthetic capsular tissues in surgical conditions. These allow estimating contamination degree. The experiments were made on a Van de Graaff accelerator located at CERI (Centre d'Etude et de Recherche par Irradiation, Orleans, France). We measure elemental concentrations resulting from the contamination of the surface of each sample. Results are analysed in function of the pathology and the type of implants. According to the pathology and the location of the sampling, these measurements show a very heterogeneous contamination by metallic elements under particles and/or ionic species which can migrate through soft tissues by various mechanisms

First, we determined steady-state activity ratios of 232Th progeny from 13 autopsy cases and found them to be identical to those reported in German subjects. Second, we estimated the alpha dose rates in 206 subjects at autopsy from radioactivity measurements and terminal weights of the organs. Combining these results with measurements of exhaled 220Rn in survivors, we considered the representative dose rates at injection to be 0.22 Gy y-1. Additionally, our data suggest that deposition in the spleen has previously been overestimated. This is an error with some bearing on the evaluation of leukemia risks from alpha-particle irradiation

Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another

Twenty one patients were treated for cerebrovascular abnormalities and 23 patients were treated for intracranial tumors. Fifteen of the 23 patients treated for intracranial tumors had received previous radiotherapy. The range of doses given by radiosurgery was 1000-2500 cGy. Nausea and vomiting occurred in seven patients within six hours of treatment. The incidence and symptoms were correlated with the dose of radiation to the vomiting center (area postrema) with the median dose to the postrema in symptomatic patients being 618 cGy compared to a range of less than 5 to 184 cGy in the remaining 36 asymptomatic patients. Temporary alopecia occurred in a single patient who received 400 cGy to the scalp. Alopecia did not occur in the remaining 43 patients who received from less than 5 to 175 cGy. Two patients treated for arteriovenous malformations developed an enhancing lesion on CT scanning (one with cerebral edema) on follow-up CT scanning six and twenty-eight months following radiosurgery. The location of these enhancing lesions corresponded to the volumes treated. In one patient, the enhancing pattern and edema disappeared within 18 months of treatment and no neurological deficits developed. Aphasia occurred in one patient treated for a recurrent glioma two hours following treatment to the left temporal lobe and cleared within 12 h of radiosurgery. One patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the pons developed weakness of the contralateral arm and leg six weeks following treatment and this has slowly resolved over the last 12 months.

Twenty one patients were treated for cerebrovascular abnormalities and 23 patients were treated for intracranial tumors. Fifteen of the 23 patients treated for intracranial tumors had received previous radiotherapy. The range of doses given by radiosurgery was 1000-2500 cGy. Nausea and vomiting occurred in seven patients within six hours of treatment. The incidence and symptoms were correlated with the dose of radiation to the vomiting center (area postrema) with the median dose to the postrema in symptomatic patients being 618 cGy compared to a range of less than 5 to 184 cGy in the remaining 36 asymptomatic patients. Temporary alopecia occurred in a single patient who received 400 cGy to the scalp. Alopecia did not occur in the remaining 43 patients who received from less than 5 to 175 cGy. Two patients treated for arteriovenous malformations developed an enhancing lesion on CT scanning (one with cerebral edema) on follow-up CT scanning six and twenty-eight months following radiosurgery. The location of these enhancing lesions corresponded to the volumes treated. In one patient, the enhancing pattern and edema disappeared within 18 months of treatment and no neurological deficits developed. Aphasia occurred in one patient treated for a recurrent glioma two hours following treatment to the left temporal lobe and cleared within 12 h of radiosurgery. One patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the pons developed weakness of the contralateral arm and leg six weeks following treatment and this has slowly resolved over the last 12 months. In conclusion, the complications to date have been self-limited and appear to be directly related to the dose and area of brain treated.

0	1037	New equations for matching a low neck field to oblique upper neck fields with collimator rotation in a 3-field monoisocentric setup for head-and-neck cancers	Algorithms, Film Dosimetry, Forecasting, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Neck/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rotation, Software, Texas, Water	With a monoisocentric 3-field technique for treating head-and-neck cancer, collimator rotation may be needed for the upper lateral fields to avoid cephalad-positioned shoulders or to avoid unnecessary arytenoid irradiation while maintaining more anterior coverage. For patients with unilateral lymphadenopathy, lateral oblique-opposed boost fields can be used to encompass the primary tumor and ipsilateral lymph nodes without junctioning through gross disease. When initial collimated lateral fields are also rotated with a gantry angle to produce oblique boost fields, however, the resulting matchline with a low anterior neck (LAN) boost field is no longer nondivergent. This can be corrected by manual adjustment of collimator and gantry angles for the LAN field using 3D treatment planning software. The goal of this study was to derive mathematical formulas to simplify this process. We used a transformation matrix to define formulas that could predict the appropriate modifications to the LAN boost field. Output from the formulas was (1) visually tested within 3D treatment planning software and (2) verified using a solid water head-and-neck phantom and radiographic film dosimetry to confirm that a nondivergent matchline was obtained in several clinical scenarios. When evaluated with 3D treatment planning software, the formulas accurately predicted the appropriate gantry and collimator angles of the LAN boost field for a variety of possible beam combinations. When evaluated with film dosimetry, the formulas were shown to accurately predict the appropriate gantry and collimator angles of the LAN boost field to within the +/- 2 mm/1 degrees tolerance specifications of the linear accelerator and acceptable for routine clinical use. The presented formulas are simple and geometrically precise. They predict the necessary manipulations of the LAN boost field to maintain a geometrically precise matchline, as verified by 3D treatment planning software, phantom dosimetry, and actual patient setups

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan

METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

It has been expected to reduce local recurrence, increase the chance of sphincter-preserving operation and improve survival. However, recent advances in surgical technique for rectal cancers have reduced the local recurrence rate to no more than 10%, where the question may arise of whether adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is indeed necessary. Another matter to be elucidated is why adjuvant chemoradiotherapy does not necessarily improve overall survival for rectal cancers even when the local recurrence rate is reduced. In the treatment of locally recurrent lesions, either heavy ion radiotherapy or proton beam therapy is expected to be an effective alternative to the surgical procedure. [References: 24]

This technique allows treatment of small (less than 40 mm diameter) intracranial lesions, including vascular malformations, and primary and metastatic tumors that are deep within the brain or in areas not amenable to open surgery. A beam of ionizing radiation (1800 to 2500 cGy) is focused on the center of the lesion, which is determined by stereotactic localization. "Dynamic rotation" of the linac gantry and table continuously about this predetermined point ensures that only the lesion receives the full radiation dose, while the normal structures in the head receive minimal amounts of radiation. The system combines, for the first time in one place, elements of radiosurgical technique developed at various centers. Testing for accuracy compares favorably with results at other centers using linac-based systems as well as comparing favorably with the gamma knife

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HCC for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy. Four patients had renal failure, 2 patients had severe heart disease, 9 patients had severe cirrhosis, 1 patient had aplastic anemia, 1 patient had a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm before treatment, and 4 patients had bleeding tendency or unresectable tumors. Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to iodine, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the tumors ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm). No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for tumor treatments. RESULTS: All but 1 of the irradiated tumors were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years. Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant metastases in the lungs. Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and all recurrent tumors were controlled. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively. Grade > or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with HCC. The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with HCC who had limited treatment options. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society

The tomotherapy unit can generate CT images from the megavoltage radiation it uses for treatment as often as needed during a course of radiation therapy. These megavoltage CT (MVCT) images offer verification of patient position prior to and potentially during radiation therapy, and provide considerably more anatomical detail than the conventional radiation therapy port films used for patient set-up verification. Also, MVCT imaging may enable reconstruction of the radiation dose delivered, thereby providing unprecedented verification of the actual treatment. These key features of helical tomotherapy distinguish it from other IMRT approaches. We report results from a pilot feasibility trial of 10 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on whom we obtained MVCT images using a prototype helical tomotherapy system. All patients underwent conventional CT imaging for radiation therapy treatment planning. Specific aims were to subjectively compare MVCT and conventional CT images and then to objectively compare the 2 modalities by contouring tumors and performing a volumetric comparison. Seven patients had disease located primarily in the lung parenchyma, 2 primarily in the mediastinum, and 1 in both. When evaluated by location, all 7 patients with lesions primarily in the lung parenchyma had subjectively high-quality MVCT images. Objectively, the volumetric agreement between conventional and MVCT for parenchymal lesions was excellent in 5 of the 7 patients. Megavoltage CT imaging via the helical tomotherapy prototype provided adequate information for use in verification of patient position and dose reconstruction for lesions within the pulmonary parenchyma, but presently appears suboptimal for primarily mediastinal disease. Further studies are ongoing to optimize MVCT imaging and better define its utility in patients with NSCLC

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2000, 33 patients with head and neck malignancies but no history of surgical resection were treated with 250-MeV protons with or without X-ray irradiation. This study retrospectively evaluated local control, survival, and treatment sequelae of these patients. The median total target dose using protons with or without X-rays was 76 Gy (range: 42-99 Gy) and the median proton dose per fraction 2.8 Gy (range: 1.5-6.0 Gy). RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival and local control rates were 44% and 74%, respectively. One (3%) and six patients (18%) suffered from treatment-related acute and late toxicity > grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria). One patient with a history of radiotherapy suffered from acute toxicity > grade 3. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy appeared to offer high local control rates with few toxicities relative to conventional radiotherapy. However, late toxicity was seen in areas where large radiation doses had been given

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2000, 33 patients with head and neck malignancies but no history of surgical resection were treated with 250-MeV protons with or without X-ray irradiation. This study retrospectively evaluated local control, survival, and treatment sequelae of these patients. The median total target dose using protons with or without X-rays was 76 Gy (range: 42-99 Gy) and the median proton dose per fraction 2.8 Gy (range: 1.5-6.0 Gy). RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival and local control rates were 44% and 74%, respectively. One (3%) and six patients (18%) suffered from treatment-related acute and late toxicity > grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria). One patient with a history of radiotherapy suffered from acute toxicity > grade 3. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy appeared to offer high local control rates with few toxicities relative to conventional radiotherapy. However, late toxicity was seen in areas where large radiation doses had been given

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities.

In that survival rate radiotherapy takes part in 15%. By further development of radiological methods and techniques radiotherapy gains significance in the recent time. Optimizing radiation planning and tactics, all modern imaging techniques are applied consequently. The radiotherapist must be able to asses their immanent specifity which should remain object of the radiological training, even if separated into therapy and diagnostics. Dose distribution is calculated by computer; three-dimensional planning is done in tumors of the mediastinum, oesophagus carcinoma and paraaortic lymphomas. Critical description of radiation techniques, results, problems and prognoses are given by results in tumors of the epipharynx and gastric cancer. After-loading, done until now only in gynaecological tumors, is performed in recurrences of pharyngeal tumors by individually shaped applicators. Reducing the number of therapy failures as well as possible, the application of higher tumor doses, new kinds of rays as neutrons and combinations with physical and chemical methods is outlined. Modifications of radiation volumes are discussed, especially the irradiation of the complete abdomen in ovarian cancer, the irradiation of the complete body surface by electrons in mycosis fungoides, and the total body irradiation prior to autologue bone marrow transplantation. Modifications of fractionation are shown in short-time radiation of bone metastases and single-time radiation of brain lesions. Low penetrating electron therapy facilitates intraoperative single-time irradiation. Because of higher biological efficiency neutrons and heavy ions allow to irradiate low sensible tumors or recurrences embedded in fibrotic tissue respectively. The combination with hyperthermia yields good results in tumors of the head and neck with better local response and total remissions of 59%. There are potentials in synchronising with chemotherapeutics. Remissions of different duration were achieved in 190 patients. Because of neutrotoxicity there are still problems in applicating radiosensitizers. New methods are applied treating endocrine active tumors by labelled hormone precursers. [References: 27]	
0	1388	Analysis of complex-type chromosome exchanges in astronauts' lymphocytes after space flight as a biomarker of high-LET exposure	Astronauts, Biological Markers, Cell Cycle, Chromosomes/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Metaphase, Radiation, Space Flight, Time, Uncertainty	High-LET radiation is more efficient in producing complex-type chromosome exchanges than sparsely ionizing radiation, and this can potentially be used as a biomarker of radiation quality. To investigate if complex chromosome exchanges are induced by the high-LET component of space radiation exposure, damage was assessed in astronauts' blood lymphocytes before and after long duration missions of 3-4 months. The frequency of simple translocations increased significantly for most of the crewmembers studied. However, there were few complex exchanges detected and only one crewmember had a significant increase after flight. It has been suggested that the yield of complex chromosome damage could be underestimated when analyzing metaphase cells collected at one time point after irradiation, and analysis of chemically-induced PCC may be more accurate since problems with complicated cell-cycle delays are avoided. However, in this case the yields of chromosome damage were similar for metaphase and PCC analysis of astronauts' lymphocytes. It appears that the use of complex-type exchanges as biomarker of radiation quality in vivo after low-dose chronic exposure in mixed radiation fields is hampered by statistical uncertainties

With 5 to 6 weeks irradiation, daily fractions resulted in a significantly more pronounced skin erythema (p less than 0.05) than twice-a-week fractions, corresponding to about 10% in terms of absorbed dose. With 4 weeks irradiation and split-course therapy, the acute reactions were identical with both schedules. We interpret these findings as indicating a radiation-induced accelerated repopulation of the basal cells in the epidermis, with a fairly abrupt onset after 4 weeks. The higher effect after more frequent fractions of smaller size would be expected from a sensitizing effect of redistribution. In conclusion, the overall treatment time is of importance for establishment of iso-effect relationships for acutely responding tissues. The implication is that different fractionation parameters used in models to predict equivalent radiation effects of different fractionation schedules also vary significantly with the overall treatment time

Autopsy imaging is a postmortem and preautopsy diagnostic procedure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Scanning is performed with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system before autopsy. The AI results are reported to the pathologist and, in light of this information, autopsy is performed with minute precision. Autopsy imaging was performed on 37 cancer cases. In seven cases, AI was less informative than the autopsy, but in 30 cases, more precise reports on the final diagnosis were available with the combined application of autopsy and AI than autopsy alone, particularly in eight limited autopsy cases. Thus, AI provides critical and supplementary information for autopsy; furthermore, AI itself is a unique imaging system of great importance

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

Therefore, 10B is selectively carried into tumours, being linked to a molecular vehicle. The tissues are then irradiated with thermal neutrons, and the boron neutron capture leads to the formation of alpha and 7Li particles which produce high levels of radiolytic damage along their range of 10 microns. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) uses a thermal/epithermal neutron beam for irradiation, while boron neutron capture potentiation uses the addition of the captures in a fast neutron irradiation. A first trial, conducted in 1951 to 1961 in the USA to test BNCT on patients suffering of glioblastoma, was a failure, essentially because 10B was located in the cerebral capillaries rather than in the tumoral cells. Today, with great improvement in the boronated compounds which show an uptake preferentially inside the cells; the quality of neutron beams; and the knowledge of the microdosimetry of the technique, this technique may be clinically used to increase the local control of radioresistant tumours, like the high grade gliomas, cutaneous or uveal melanoma, and perhaps soft tissue sarcomas.

1	4484	Phase I/II study of proton beam irradiation for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration: treatment techniques and preliminary results	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Angiography, Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Humans, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Methods, Morbidity, Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Reading, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration is the prevalent etiology of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The only effective treatment is laser photocoagulation, which is associated with decreased visual acuity following treatment in most patients. This study assessed both the response of subfoveal CNV to proton beam irradiation and treatment-related morbidity. We evaluated preliminary results in patients treated with an initial dose of 8 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) using a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with subfoveal CNV received proton irradiation to the central macula with a single fraction of 8 CGE; 19 were eligible for evaluation. Treatment-related morbidity was based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria; response was evaluated by Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) guidelines. Fluorescein angiography was performed; visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and reading speed were measured at study entry and at 3-month intervals after treatment. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 15 months. RESULTS: No measurable treatment-related morbidity was seen during or after treatment. Of 19 patients evaluated at 6 months, fluorescein angiography demonstrated treatment response in 10 (53%); 14 (74%) patients had improved or stable visual acuity. With a mean follow-up of 11.6 months, 11 (58%) patients have demonstrated improved or stable visual acuity. CONCLUSION: A macular dose of 8 CGE yielded no measurable treatment morbidity in patients studied. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated that regressed or stabilized lesions were associated with improved visual acuity as compared with MPS results. In the next phase, a dose of 14 CGE in a single fraction will be used to further define the optimal dose fractionation schedule

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report dosimetric results for 72 cases of mycosis fungoides, using similar irradiation techniques on two different linear accelerators. All patients were treated using a modified Stanford 6-field technique. In vivo TLD was done on all patients, and the data for all patients treated on both machines was collected into a database for analysis. Means and standard deviations (SDs) were computed for all locations. Scatter plots of doses vs. height, weight, and obesity index were generated, and correlation coefficients with these variables were computed. RESULTS: The TLD results show that our current TSEB implementation is dosimetrically equivalent to the previous implementation, and that our beam calibration technique and monitor unit calculation is accurate. Correlations with obesity index were significant at several sites. Individual TLD results allow us to customize the boost treatment for each patient, in addition to revealing patient positioning problems and/or systematic variations in dose caused by patient variability. The data agree well with previously published TLD results for similar TSEB techniques. CONCLUSION: TLD is an important part of the treatment planning and quality assurance programs for TSEB, and routine use of TLD measurements for TSEB is recommended

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report dosimetric results for 72 cases of mycosis fungoides, using similar irradiation techniques on two different linear accelerators. All patients were treated using a modified Stanford 6-field technique. In vivo TLD was done on all patients, and the data for all patients treated on both machines was collected into a database for analysis. Means and standard deviations (SDs) were computed for all locations. Scatter plots of doses vs. height, weight, and obesity index were generated, and correlation coefficients with these variables were computed. RESULTS: The TLD results show that our current TSEB implementation is dosimetrically equivalent to the previous implementation, and that our beam calibration technique and monitor unit calculation is accurate. Correlations with obesity index were significant at several sites. Individual TLD results allow us to customize the boost treatment for each patient, in addition to revealing patient positioning problems and/or systematic variations in dose caused by patient variability. The data agree well with previously published TLD results for similar TSEB techniques. CONCLUSION: TLD is an important part of the treatment planning and quality assurance programs for TSEB, and routine use of TLD measurements for TSEB is recommended

OBJECTIVE: To compare various methods of modeling the relationship between tumor dimension and metastatic death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1204 patients with primary choroidal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between January 1985 and December 1998. Largest basal diameter and largest perpendicular basal diameter were recorded at the time of surgical placement of tantalum rings used for tumor localization during proton treatment. The height of the tumor and the axial diameter of the eye were measured by ultrasonography prior to treatment. Using proportional hazards regression, we compared the prognostic influence of different indices of tumor size with estimated risk ratios and death rates according to tumor basal area and largest basal diameter. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up annually through June 30, 2000. Of the 1204 patients analyzed, 193 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up among survivors was 7.9 years. The 5- and 10-year metastatic death rates were 12.8% and 20.7%, respectively. Among various approaches for modeling tumor dimension, the logarithm of tumor basal area had the highest log-likelihood and performed better than other approaches in 85% of the simulations. Based on this model, the covariate-adjusted rate ratio for any doubling in tumor basal area was 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.28). CONCLUSION: Tumor basal area is a better prognostic indicator than largest tumor diameter and tumor volume in the prediction of metastatic death after proton beam irradiation for uveal melanoma

Proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE), making use of the resonance reaction of 19F(p, alpha gamma)16O at 872 keV, and cyclic neutron activation analysis (CNAA), using the 19F(n, gamma)20F reaction in a reactor irradiation facility, were employed. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was used to calculate the volume, and, hence, mass of the sample excited in PIGE by determining the major element composition of the samples in order to express results in terms of concentration. From this preliminary investigation, a relationship is suggested between fluorine concentrations in bone and aluminium levels in the system

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290MeV/u), silicon (490MeV/u) and iron (200 and 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. PCC were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 min. RESULTS: The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components representing a rapid and a slow time constant. Chromatid breaks decreased rapidly during the first 10min after exposure, then continued to decrease at a slower rate. The rejoining kinetics were similar for exposure to each type of radiation. Chromatid exchanges were also formed quickly. Compared to low-LET radiation, isochromatid breaks were produced more frequently and the proportion of unrejoined breaks was higher for high-LET radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gamma-rays, isochromatid breaks were observed more frequently in high-LET irradiated samples, suggesting that an increase in isochromatid breaks is a signature of high-LET radiation exposure	
1	1266	Clinical dosimetry with MOSFET dosimeters to determine the dose along the field junction in a split beam technique	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Calibration, Humans, Lead, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Quality Control, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report on the accuracy of metal oxide-silicon semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors to measure dose distributions in the region of a field junction in a split beam technique, compared to ionisation chamber and photographic film. We present a study on five patients receiving loco-regional treatment for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose variation at the junction was measured with the patient dose verification system model TN-RD-50 (MOSFET system). Phantom measurements were performed to investigate the MOSFET accuracy in a half-field matching method and the influence of factors related to the accelerator. The aim of the patient measurements was to determine the effect of patient related factors on the dose at the junction over a period of 10 irradiation fractions. RESULTS: The MOSFET detector overestimates the dose in the junction area, therefore a correction factor was determined to correct the MOSFET results. Phantom measurements showed overdosages as well as underdosages, depending on the matching field direction (X or Y). Patient measurements showed dose values that deviated up to 133%+/-3% (2 S.D.). The average values of 10 irradiation sessions showed a continuous, almost linear, variation of dose value across the junction. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Significant dose deviations in the junction area average out over repeated treatments; (2) one individual measurement in the junction area should not lead to any action; (3) a linac QA procedure to check the dose at the junction line should simulate the clinical situation sufficiently; and (4) MOSFET dosimeters overestimate dose values in the penumbra region

Neutrons are produced by bombarding a beryllium target with 65 MeV protons. A CNPF of 2.8 was adopted. As far as soft tissue sarcomas are concerned, 32 patients were irradiated after "radical" surgery: only 2 local recurrences were observed (follow-up from 6 months to more that 5 years). On the other hand, in a group of 26 patients with large inoperable, recurrent of incompletely resected tumours, local control could not be achieved in 14 cases. In the whole group of these 58 patients, 12 severe complications were observed; their frequency increases with field size which in turn reflects tumour extent. Locally extended prostatic adenocarcinomas (stage C) were treated with mixed schedule irradiation (3 neutron and 2 photon fractions per week). A local control rate of 93% at 1 year, of 83% at 2 years, and 90% at 3 years was achieved (28, 23 and 10 patients respectively). The early and late tolerance was excellent; only one complication was observed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

In the assessment of retinal hemangioblastomas it is necessary to know about VHL, an autosomal dominant disease, a multisystem familial tumour syndrome. METHODS: An overview of the diagnosis and therapy of VHL is presented. RESULTS: Minimal criteria of the syndrome are tumours in one index patient and one of the typical lesions in another first-degree relative. Retinal hemangioblastomas were already found in children. Only 5 % of patients with VHL present retinal capillary hemangioma before the age of 10 years, and most patients present between the ages of 10 and 40 years. Data suggest that retinal capillary hemangioma is usually manifested by the age of 30 years. The VHL gene functions as a tumour suppressor gene and is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3p25. The mapping of a locus for VHL has offered the prospect of presymptomatic diagnosis of the disease using DNA markers. Small retinal tumours are treated by photocoagulation, big hemangioblastomas by cryotherapy. Modern options in treatment of retinal tumours are proton therapy, plaque radiotherapy, pars-plana vitrectomy, photodynamic therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy and systemic treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor, in addition. CONCLUSIONS: The interdisciplinary Freiburg VHL study which has been in existence for more than 20 years, has shown that an extensive family screening for early detection of the disease is necessary. The assessment of the diagnosis in a VHL carrier requires close follow-up for multiple and recurrent tumours. [References: 176]

The tumors of all patients were histologically confirmed. A 45 MV betatron was used for radiation of the clipped tumor volume plus a 1 to 2 cm margin. Fourteen patients were treated by a three-field technic with the use of opposed lateral photon beams and an anterior mixed photon-electron beam. Five patients were treated with either a four-field "box" or a three-field photon technic. Tumor doses of 5,900 to 6,700 r were delivered over seven to nine weeks. The twelve month survival rate after diagnosis is 53%. This compares favorably with published reports of patients treated surgically for cure. Four patients are alive 18.5 to 64 months after diagnosis. Three are clinically free of disease. Treatment has been well tolerated and there have been no significant radiation complications

We review our experience over 7 years treating 29 consecutive patients with a modified linear accelerator (linac) SRS system. Between August 1989 and October 1995, 29 patients with a median age of 67 years (range 26 to 83) underwent linac SRS treatment. Twenty-five patients had unilateral acoustic neuromas, and four patients with neurofibromatosis type II had bilateral vestibular schwannoma. Eligibility criteria for SRS were recurrent tumors (n = 9), age >65 (n = 16), or patient preference (n = 6). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed on all patients. The most common presenting symptoms were hearing impairment (18 patients) and gait difficulties (17 patients). Ten patients were deaf in the affected ear prior to treatment. Doses to the periphery of the tumor ranged from 800 to 2,400 cGy (median 1, 600 cGy) prescribed to the 50% to 80% isodose line (median 80%). After a median radiographic follow-up of 49 months (range 4 to 110 months), 11 tumors were smaller, 17 were stable, and one had evidence of progression (at 41 months). The 5-year local disease control rate (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 94%. Acute complications were minimal, with only two patients experiencing nausea and vomiting after the procedure. Long-term complications included new or progressive trigeminal and facial nerve deficits with estimated 5-year incidences of 15% and 32%, respectively. Subjective hearing reduction or loss occurred in 14 (74%) of the 19 patients who had useful hearing prior to treatment. Five patients died from unrelated causes. These results suggest that linac SRS provides excellent short-term tumor control rates. Since there was a high risk of cranial nerve neuropathy, we do not recommend using only computed tomography-based planning and high prescription doses. Int. J. Cancer (Radiat. Oncol.

METHODS: Retrospective review of 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. Several parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis techniques were used. RESULTS: In 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma, the mean dimension for largest basal diameter was 11.9 mm (range 5 mm to 24 mm). The mean tumor thickness was 6.7 mm (range 1.3 mm to 14.2 mm). Following helium ion radiation 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. At 10 years after radiation 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes were enucleated; the majority (37 of 46) of enucleations were due to anterior ocular segment complications. At 10 years after radiation 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; half had non-tumor related deaths and 51 died from metastatic melanoma. Best corrected visual acuity after radiation was > or = 20/40 in 21 of 93 eyes of patients that were alive and retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors that were less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm away from the nerve or the fovea, 13 of 18 (72%) retained > or = 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of acuity. The actuarial enucleation rate at 5 years was 17.2% (2.7% S.E.) and at 10 years this was 22.4% (3.1% S.E). The recurrence tumor control rate at both 5 and 10 years was 5.3% (S.E 1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion radiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In tumors that are less than 6 mm in thickness and greater than 3 mm from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision.

METHODS: Retrospective review of 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. Several parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis techniques were used. RESULTS: In 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma, the mean dimension for largest basal diameter was 11.9 mm (range 5 mm to 24 mm). The mean tumor thickness was 6.7 mm (range 1.3 mm to 14.2 mm). Following helium ion radiation 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. At 10 years after radiation 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes were enucleated; the majority (37 of 46) of enucleations were due to anterior ocular segment complications. At 10 years after radiation 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; half had non-tumor related deaths and 51 died from metastatic melanoma.

1	675	Proton beam radiotherapy versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: A comparative study	Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Germany, Humans, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study was undertaken between proton and photon therapy in uveal melanoma to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. A fixed proton horizontal beam (OPTIS) and intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT), with multiple noncoplanar beam arrangements, was compared with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), using a static and a dynamic micromultileaf collimator and intensity-modulated RT (IMRS). METHOD AND MATERIALS: A planning CT scan was performed on a brain metastasis patient, with a 3-mm acquisition slice spacing and the patient looking at a luminous spot with the eyes in three different positions (neutral and 25 degrees right and left). Four different gross tumor volumes were defined for each treatment technique. These target scenarios represented different locations (involving vs. not involving the macula and temporal vs. nasal) and volumes (10 x 6 mm vs. 16 x 10 mm) to challenge the proton and photon treatment techniques. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 2 mm laterally and 3 mm craniocaudally for both modalities. A dose homogeneity of 95-99% of the planning target volume was used as the "goal" for all techniques. The dose constraint (maximum) for the organs at risk (OARs) for both the proton and the SRT photon plans was 27.5, 22.5, 20, and 9 CGE-Gy for the optic apparatus, retina, lacrimal gland, and lens, respectively. The dose to the planning target volume was 50 CGE-Gy in 10 CGE-Gy daily fractions. The plans for proton and photon therapy were computed using the Paul Scherrer Institute and BrainSCAN, version 5.2 (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) treatment planning systems, respectively. Tumor and OARs dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using the dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index (CI(95%)), and inhomogeneity coefficient. RESULTS: Target coverage of all simulated uveal melanomas was equally conformal with the photon and proton modalities. The median CI(95%) value was 1.74, 1.86, and 1.83 for the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively. With proton planning, the median CI(95%) was 1.88 for OPTIS and substantially improved with IMPT in some tumor cases (median CI(95%), 1.29). The tumor dose homogeneity in the proton plans was, however, always better than with SRT photon planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient 0.1 and 0.15 vs. 0.46, 0.41, and 0.23 for the OPTIS and IMPT vs. the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively). Compared with the photon plans, the use of protons did not lead to a substantial reduction in the homolateral OAR total integral dose in the low- to high-dose level, except for the lacrimal gland. The median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume with the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans was 33-30.8, 31.8-28, and 35.8-49 Gy, respectively, for the lacrimal gland, a critical organ. For protons, only the OPTIS plans were better, with a median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume using OPTIS and IMPT of 19.2 and 8.8 and 25.6 and 23.6 CGE, respectively. The contralateral OARs were completely spared with the proton plans, but the median dose delivered to these structures was 1.2 Gy (range, 0-6.3 Gy) with the SRT photon plans. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of SRT photon techniques, compared with protons, can result in similar levels of dose conformation. IMPT did not increase the degree of conformality for this small tumor. Tumor dose inhomogeneity was, however, always increased with photon planning. Except for the lacrimal gland, the use of protons, with or without intensity modulation, did not increase homolateral OAR dose sparing. The dose to all the contralateral OARs was, however, completely eliminated with proton planning

For skull base tumors, 10-year local control rates with combined proton-photon therapy are highest for chondrosarcomas, intermediate for male chordomas, and lowest for female chordomas (94%, 65%, and 42%, respectively). For cervical spine tumors, 10-year local control rates are not significantly different for chordomas and chondrosarcomas (54% and 48%, respectively), nor is there any difference in local control between males and females. Observed treatment-related morbidity has been judged acceptable, in view of the major morbidity and mortality which accompany uncontrolled tumor growth. [References: 46]

In addition, heavy-ions are high-LET radiations and have increased biological effectiveness when compared with photons or protons. The potential indications for them are those diseases which are usually hard to cure with conventional radiations. At present there are 17 operating facilities world-wide for proton therapy, which in Japan is being conducted at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) and Tsukuba University (PMRC). Currently, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in USA and the National Cancer Institute East Hospital in Japan are building a hospital-based proton facility, both of them will have a fixed energy cyclotron (230MeV). New plans for commencing proton therapy are also proposed by many other institutions in the world. As with heavy-ion therapy, clinical trials have been carried out since 1994 using carbon-ions generated by HIMAC (Heavy-ion medical accelerator in Chiba) at NIRS. The HIMAC is the world's only heavy-ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. The Hyogo prefecture has just decided to build a similar ion therapy facility. As of February 1997, a total of 230 patients were treated in carbon-ion Phase I/II studies at NIRS. So far, carbon-ions appear to be effective in such cases as locally advanced tumors and non-squamous tumors. [References: 18]

For most cancer sites, the risk model is one in which age-specific, relative risk coefficients are obtained by taking a geometric mean of the coefficients derived from the atomic bomb survivor data using two different methods for transporting risks from the Japanese to the U.S. population. The risk models are applied to estimate organ-specific risks per unit dose for a stationary population with mortality rates governed by 1980 U.S. vital statistics. With the exception of breast cancer, low-LET radiogenic cancer risk estimates are reduced by a factor of 2 at low doses and dose rates compared to acute high dose exposure conditions. For low dose (or dose rate) conditions, the risk of inducing a premature cancer death from uniform, whole body, low-LET irradiation is calculated to be 5.1 x 10(-2) Gy-1. Neglecting nonfatal skin cancers, the corresponding incidence risk is 7.6 x 10(-2) Gy-1. High-LET (alpha particle) risks are presumed to increase linearly with dose and to be independent of dose rate. High-LET risks are estimated to be 20 times the low-LET risks estimated under low dose rate conditions, except for leukemia and breast cancer where RBEs of 1 and 10 are adopted, respectively

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions

The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions

[Review] [16 refs]	Antineoplastic Agents, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Choroid Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Choroid Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Choroid Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Photons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods]	Therapy of choroidal metastases depends on several factors, but conventional external beam irradiation using photons is the most common treatment. Proton beam irradiation has recently been used for selected lesions. The advantage of this method is that the dose can be localized to the tumor more accurately. Other therapies include chemotherapy, photocoagulation, or, in extreme cases, enucleation. The author discusses these treatment modalities, complications, and prospects for future therapies.

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1066-1070

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In intracranial benign and malignant tumours, it is estimated that between 130 and 180 patients each year are candidates for proton beam therapy. Of these, between 50 and 75 patients have malignant glioma, 30-40 meningeoma, 20-25 arteriovenous malformations, 20-25 skull base tumours and 10-15 pituitary adenoma. In addition, 15 patients with ocular melanoma are candidates. [References: 93]

Group A was treated with conventional dose/fraction (180-200 cGy) X 5 days/week and Group B was treated with 250 cGy/fraction X 4 days/week. Total dose was reduced by 10% in Group B patients to allow comparison of biologically equivalent doses. Two categories of patients were analyzed in each group: patients receiving planned high dose preoperative radiation (4000-4500 cGy); and patients receiving high dose radiation for post-surgical recurrent tumors or locally advanced inoperable tumors (5500-6000 cGy). Tumor regression was markedly better in patients treated with the 250 cGy/fraction. Overall response (greater than 50% regression) was 35% (10/29) in Group A and 62% (18/29) in Group B. Nine of 10 patients in Group B, treated preoperatively, had greater than 50% regression in tumor size, with two patients having no evidence of disease on surgico-pathological evaluation.

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer received accelerated photon and proton radiation, 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions/5.5 weeks, to the primary disease, involved lymph nodes, and potential areas of subclinical spread. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial control for local disease was 88%, and for neck node disease, 96%; yielding a 84% locoregional control rate at 5 years. Four patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 84%. The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival rate was 81%; at 5 years, it was 65%. All patients completed the prescribed treatment; though aggressive nutritional and anesthetic support was necessary. Late Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Protons used as a concomitant boost with photons effectively delivered an accelerated time-dose schedule to the cancer with a more tolerable schedule to surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary results reveal increased locoregional control without increased toxicity. Future studies must evaluate the optimum time-dose schedule

0	751	Proton radiation for treatment of cancer of the oropharynx: early experience at Loma Linda University Medical Center using a concomitant boost technique	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Humans, Neoplasm Staging, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To assess accelerated fractionation using photon and proton radiation to improve local control and reduce complications in treating locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer received accelerated photon and proton radiation, 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions/5.5 weeks, to the primary disease, involved lymph nodes, and potential areas of subclinical spread. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial control for local disease was 88%, and for neck node disease, 96%; yielding a 84% locoregional control rate at 5 years. Four patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 84%. The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival rate was 81%; at 5 years, it was 65%. All patients completed the prescribed treatment; though aggressive nutritional and anesthetic support was necessary. Late Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Protons used as a concomitant boost with photons effectively delivered an accelerated time-dose schedule to the cancer with a more tolerable schedule to surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary results reveal increased locoregional control without increased toxicity. Future studies must evaluate the optimum time-dose schedule

Measurement of both photon and neutron scattered dose at the position of a fetus from chest irradiation by a large field 18 MV x-ray beam was performed using an ionization chamber and superheated drop detector, respectively. Shielding construction to reduce this scattered dose was investigated using both lead sheet and borated polyethylene slabs. A 7.35 cm lead shield reduced the scattered photon dose by 50% and the scattered neutron dose by 40%. Adding 10 cm of 5% borated polyethylene to this lead shield reduced the scattered neutron dose by a factor of 7.5 from the unshielded value. When the 5% borated polyethylene was replaced by the same thickness of 30% borated polyethylene there was no significant change in the reduction of neutron scatter dose. The most efficient shield studied reduced the neutron scatter dose by a factor of 10. The results indicate that most of the scattered neutrons present at the position of the fetus produced by an 18 MV x-ray beam are of low energy and in the thermal to 0.57 MeV range since lead is almost transparent to neutrons with energies lower than 0.57 MeV. This article constitutes the first report of an effective shield to reduce neutron dose at the fetus when treating a pregnant woman with a high energy x-ray beam	
0	3461	In vivo diode dosimetry for total marrow irradiation	Bone Marrow/re [Radiation Effects], Calibration, Humans, Immobilization, Methods, Multiple Myeloma/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reading, Silicon, Skin, Time, Transplantation Conditioning, Umbilicus	PURPOSE: To describe a method and evaluate the efficacy of using a p-type silicon diode as an alternative to thermoluminescent dosimeters for verifying the accuracy of total marrow irradiation setups and calculations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A calibration factor has been measured for a 6 MV photon beam incident horizontally onto a polystyrene phantom inside an in-house built total marrow irradiation stand. Signal responses due to positioning and orientation of the diode with respect to the source were compared to a 0.6 cc cylindrical ionization chamber inside a polystyrene phantom. Procedures for predicting the diode reading and taking entrance measurements have been developed and action levels established to determine causes for discrepancies when ratios between predicted and actual values fell outside a +/- 5% tolerance range. Measurements were taken at the skin surface over the umbilicus calculation point for alternating 1.5 Gy anterior and posterior fractions given bidaily over a 3-day period. RESULTS: A total of 137 measurements taken from January to September 1994 for 23 patients were analyzed using a frequency histogram. The histogram indicated a mean reading of 1.002 +/- 2.6, and that three of the measurements fell outside the 5% tolerance. Investigation into the cause of the discrepancies showed that the diode had been improperly placed one time and that further patient immobilization needs to be considered. CONCLUSION: It is possible to use a diode as an in vivo dosimeter for a total marrow irradiation technique. The ease of implementation and immediate readouts make a diode system preferable to a thermoluminescent system for identifying systematic errors and verifying treatment configurations and monitor unit calculations	
0	8	Proton irradiation of malignant uveal melanoma. A five year follow-up of patients treated in Uppsala, Sweden	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty patients with malignant uveal melanoma were treated at the The Svedbergh cyclotron in Uppsala from 1989 to 1991. Each tumour received a total dose of 54.6 Gy in four equal fractions on four following days. After treatment the melanoma in all eyes showed decrease in size combined with irradiation retinopathy. In eight patients the treatment was successful after five years. Nine eyes had to be enucleated, two due to recurrence and seven due to neovascular glaucoma. Three patients died, two from metastases and one from heart disease. In all patients the visual acuity was dependent on the distance between the irradiation field and the macula or optic nerve. Each patient suffered from transient post irradiation skin erythema and permanent loss of eyelashes and eyebrows when these were included in the irradiation field. The development of secondary glaucoma was positively correlated with tumour volume, but not to the age or sex of the patients. Histological examination of all the enucleated eyes revealed residual viable tumour without obvious radiation damage: mitotic figures were not identified. MRI examination, performed before and after treatment, demonstrated a marked shift in water binding properties after irradiation. The final visual acuity was dependent on the location of the tumour

The MCNP code was used to study the dependence of these neutron fluences on room design, room area and the effect of neutron moderator materials placed on the room walls. The results of the investigation showed a poor agreement between the simulations and empirical approximations, suggesting that the formulae found in the literature can underestimate the neutron flux inside a radiotherapy room

The data were collected in 1984-1985 by the Patterns of Care Study Survey of Palliative Care conducted in 49 institutions selected to provide valid national averages for the practice patterns reported. Data were collected from 784 patient records selected from five "strata" of practice. Demographic data and process data were tabulated and national averages were calculated from the data. Four metastatic sites were selected, weight bearing bones (401), non-weight bearing bones (102), brain metastasis (224), and lung-mediastinum (57). The median patient age was 63 years, equally divided by sex. In 52% of patients this was the first metastasis. Common Karnofsky performance scores ranged from 40 to 80%. Lung, breast, and prostate were the most common primaries. Two-thirds of the patients were treated by linear accelerators, one-third by cobalt. The median number of fractions was 10, median dose 3000 cGy, median fraction size 300 cGy, and median treatment duration 15 days. The goal of treatment was relief of pain (98%) and return of function (30%) for weight bearing bones, for brain metastasis it was preservation of function (68%), pain relief (33%), and relief of compression (25%). All sites showed TDF values that ranged from 33-85, and a TDF of approximately 65 was most common for weight bearing bones and brain metastasis with no consistent pattern of TDF selection for the other sites. Compliance by strata of practice with work-up criteria was excellent with isolated poor compliance seen in several strata

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue.

All patients had received curative pelvic irradiation (greater than or equal to 1750 reu) nine to 133 months prior to the investigation. Eleven patients had recurrent or persistent disease and four (36%) of these patients had severe hematuria. The urinary morbidity of the 37 patients without evidence of disease varied between 24 and 38%, but only 3 to 8% of these patients experienced severe disturbances. Four patients (9%) had to undergo bowl resection due to severe radiation damage in the intestines. In conclusion, slight morbidity after curative radiation treatment is to be expected in about 30% of patients surviving more than six months. Severe complications may be expected in 10% of the patients. Serious complaints from the urologic tract, especially hematuria, indicate recurrent or persistent disease rather than a late radiation effect

Based on the microdosimetric specific energy spectrum in cell nuclei, a model to evaluate the biological effect induced by the internally emitted particles from a beta-delayed particle decay beam has been developed. In this paper, using this model the additional contributions to the cell-killing effect due to the emitted particles from stopping 9C ions were incorporated in the design of spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBP) for radioactive 9C beams. For this purpose, a simulated annealing algorithm was employed to optimize the superposing weighting fractions of all monoenergetic beams so that a uniform cell survival level could be realized across the SOBP within an acceptable deviation of 5%. SOBPs with different widths and at different cell survival levels were designed for both therapeutic 9C and 12C beams for comparison. The potential use of the 9C beam in radiotherapy compared to the 12C beam, which is commonly adopted in the practices of current heavy-ion therapy, is shown systematically in terms of the distributions of biological effective dose and cell survival along the beam penetration

Severe - but not vitally dangerous - complications in bladder and intestine are rare (3%); their percentage corresponds roughly to the average mortality rate of surgical intervention (radical prostatectomy). Contrary to operation, troubles of the sexual function appear only in one third of the patients. Taking into consideration the similar therapeutic results of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, radiotherapy is more favorable with respect to side effects. This essential aspect should be considered when making a decision whether to apply a surgical or a radiotherapeutic treatment treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer

In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

The length of follow-up ranged from 1-115 months (median 42 months). The 5-year actuarial treatment results were: local control rate, 96.8%, determinate survival rate, 81%, freedom from distant metastases, 76%, eye retention rate, 83%, and risk of developing neovascular glaucoma, 36%. Long-term vision outcome was analyzed in 81 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Forty-seven percent of patients retained vision of 20/200 or better. The median change in vision was a loss of four lines on the standard eye chart. Thirty-eight percent of patients had visual acuity either improve or remain within two lines of their pretreatment vision. A multivariate analysis identified tumor size as the only independently significant risk factor affecting survival, development of neovascular glaucoma, or the risk of enucleation; no risk factor correlated with local recurrence. Tumor size, tumor-fovea distance, and pretreatment visual acuity were independently significant risk factors influencing vision outcome. These results confirm that helium ion irradiation is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma which combines high rates of local control, survival, and eye retention with a substantial likelihood of long-term vision preservation

0	507	Prognostic significance of serial magnetic resonance spectroscopies over the course of radiation therapy for patients with malignant glioma	Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease Progression, Female, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Survival Analysis, Survivors	BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of high grade gliomas (HGG) involves maximal neuro-surgical debulking, followed by post-operative radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, depending on histologic grade. Despite this aggressive strategy, there are few long-term survivors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging method that can monitor metabolic changes in brain tumours. To date there is little data concerning the prognostic significance of the evolving spectral alterations during a course of radiotherapy. MATERIALS: We report herein a prospective study of patients with HGGs undergoing post-operative radiotherapy. Fourteen consecutively eligible patients with a confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant glioma and completion of all required MRS imaging were included in this study. All patients had MRS imaging prior to radiotherapy, at week 4 of radiotherapy, and 2 months post-treatment. T1 and T2 weighted images as well as post-gadolinium multi-voxel proton MRS images were obtained. Normalized (tumour metabolite/normal brain metabolite) levels of choline, NAA, creatine, lipid and lactate were calculated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of progression-free and overall survival were constructed based on the evolving patterns of metabolite changes over the course of the images. RESULTS: The mean tumour choline/NAA ratio decreased over the course of therapy, with a reduction observed between the baseline and post-radiotherapy studies (1.91 vs. 1.29, P=0.049). A similar decrease was identified with the mean normalized choline ratio, with a highly significant difference observed between the baseline and post-radiation images (1.61 vs. 0.96, P=0.001). Patients who exhibited more than 40% decrease in normalized choline between the week 4 and post-radiotherapy studies were associated with unfavourable survival (logrank test, P=0.003) and disease progression (logrank test, P=0.012). The Lactate/NAA ratio at the 4th week of radiotherapy and the change in normalized choline/creatine between baseline and week 4 of radiotherapy were also predictive of outcome suggesting the possibility of adaptive, response-based radiation treatment. Patients with two or more poor prognostic MRS indices had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with zero or one poor indices, with 15% and 68% at 1 year, respectively (logrank test, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The evolving pattern of spectral changes over the course of radiotherapy, in particular those associated with choline-containing compounds, appears to be prognostic of tumour response and outcome. Based on our data, a decision point may exist in the mid course of radical radiotherapy, at which time consideration of the choline levels could indicate the extent of radiotherapeutic response, thus allowing for individualized treatment modification

The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy

1	4432	Alopecia associated with unexpected leakage from electron cone	Alopecia/et [Etiology], Electrons, Equipment Failure, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Universities	Excessive irradiation due to unexpected leakage was found on a patient receiving electron beam therapy. The cause of this leakage was analyzed and the amount of leakage was measured for different electron beam energies. The highest leakage occurred with a 6 x 6 cm cone using a 12 MeV electron beam. The leakage dose measured along the side of the cone could be as great as 40%. Until the cones are modified or redesigned, it is advised that all patient setups be carefully reviewed to assure that no significant patient areas are in the side scatter region

METHODS: Modern skull base surgical techniques were used in all patients who were treated between August 1991 and July 2000. The degree of tumor resection was gauged according to intraoperative inspection and postoperative high-resolution imaging findings. There were 21 patients with primary disease and eight with recurrent disease. Total resection was accomplished in 18 patients. Five patients had undergone radiotherapy prior to the present surgery, and an additional eight patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. There were no surgery-related deaths. In five patients who died of the disease, surgery and radiotherapy had failed to effect a cure. Two of the remaining patients are alive with recurrent disease, and there is questionable evidence of recurrence in another patient. All 24 patients are functioning independently. Cranial nerve impairment was the most common postoperative deficit, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull base techniques in radical surgery provides an opportunity to excise the tumor and the involved bone. In most cases the procedure-related cranial nerve deficits improve over time. The complications of CSF leakage and infection can be minimized and are preventable. Proton beam irradiation is an excellent adjuvant treatment but is reserved for patients with definite tumor recurrence or residual tumor that can be identified on the imaging studies

To understand better these relations, four groups of cases were examined: 1.) 126 choroidal melanomas which were treated conservatively with Cobalt 60 applicator from 1969 till 1984. 2.) 715 choroidal melanomas which have been treated with proton-beam from 1984 to 1989. 3.) 7 tumors or pseudotumors for which for diagnostic purposes a phosphorus 32 test was necessary. 4.) 9 choroid melanomas which had conservative treatment and where vitrectomy was realized. The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment the thickness of the tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in choroid melanoma which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

0	789	Increase of enamel fluoride retention by low fluence argon laser beam: a 6-month follow-up study in vivo	Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride/ad [Administration & Dosage], Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Dental Caries/pc [Prevention & Control], Dental Enamel/me [Metabolism], Dental Enamel/re [Radiation Effects], Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Laser Therapy,Low-Level, Time, Water	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 6-month in vivo study was to investigate if argon laser irradiation of enamel can increase the retention of fluoride. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight teeth in 12 patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) EF group: 40 teeth were only treated with fluoride gel (applied for 5 minutes followed by a 1 minute rinsing with distilled water). (2) EFL group: 40 teeth were treated the same way as in the EF group but they were lased after fluoridation. (3) E group: 18 teeth were kept without any treatment as a control group. In order to quantify the fluoride content in the enamel samples, the teeth were analyzed by proton beam delivered by a tandem accelerator (PIgE, particle induced gamma-ray emission). A low energy density of argon laser beam was used: 10.74 J/cm2 (11 mm of beam diameter, irradiation time of 30 seconds, and an output power of 340 mW in continuous mode). RESULTS: The results after 6 months showed that the lased enamel still retained 52.55+/-8.47 ppm or 14.12% of fluoride after the fluoridation process, whereas the unlased enamel retained only 12.18+/-6.82 ppm or 3.27% of fluoride. The untreated and control enamel (E group: unlased and without fluoride treatment) had 1.16+/-4.27 ppm value of fluoride. The statistical test (ANOVA tests at 95% level) showed that the difference is significant between the fluoride retention in the group EFL and the group EF 6 months after fluoridation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of argon laser at low energy density (10.74 J/cm2) significantly increased the fluoride retention in lased enamel that had approximately 400 times more fluoride than the unlased enamel. We consider this procedure as an alternative clinical procedure to increase the fluoride content of enamel surface. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc

We retrospectively analyzed our experience in 239 patients to assess treatment outcome with this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1990, 239 uveal melanoma patients were treated with 125I plaques at the University of California, San Francisco. High intensity 125I seeds in the range of 3-20 mCi were used to give a minimum tumor dose of 70 Gy in 4 days. Initial mean tumor size was 10.9 mm x 9.2 mm x 5.5 mm with a range in tumor diameter from 4 to 18 mm and tumor height from 1.9 to 11.1 mm. Best corrected pre-treatment visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 92% of patients. RESULTS: Local tumor control was maintained in 91.7% of patients with a mean follow-up of 35.9 months; 19 patients had local tumor progression; mean time to progression was 27.3 mo (1.8 to 60.1 mo). Actuarial local control is 82% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrates significant correlation of local failure with larger maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0008), closer proximity to the fovea (p = 0.0001), lower radiation dose (p = 0.0437), and smaller ultrasound height (p = 0.0034). The actuarial incidence of distant metastases is 12% at 5 years with multivariate analysis showing significant correlation only with maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0064). Visual outcome is 20/200 or better in 58% of patients. CONCLUSION: While the tumor control rates appear favorable, ocular morbidity is significant. A current randomized trial comparing 125I plaque with Helium ion therapy is in progress with specific comparison of tumor control, survival, and visual outcome

Besides the physical selectivity that makes ions especially efficient for deep-seated tumours and tumours close to critical organs, carbon ions with their enhanced relative biological effectiveness offer an additional biological advantage for slow-growing radioresistant tumours, with an additional gain for tumours with hypoxic sections. These advantages can only be fully exploited by active beam-shaping and biology-based treatment planning

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 51 NSCLC patients were treated with proton beams at the University of Tsukuba. There were 28 patients in Stage I, 9 in Stage II, 8 in Stage III, 1 in Stage IV, and 5 with recurrent disease. Thirty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 17 had adenocarcinoma, and 1 had large-cell carcinoma. Median fraction and total doses given were 3.0 Gy (range 2.0-6.0 Gy), and 76.0 Gy (range 49.0-93.0 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 29% for all patients, 70% for 9 Stage IA patients, and 16% for 19 Stage IB patients, respectively (IA vs. IB: p < 0.05). The 5-year in-field local control rate was higher in patients with Stage IA (89%) when compared with those with Stage IB (39%). Forty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute lung toxicity of Grade 1 or less; 3 had Grade 2, 1 had Grade 3, and none experienced Grade 4 or higher. Patients in the present series showed very little late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is a very safe and effective treatment for patients with NSCLC, especially for those with early stages. The relative merit of proton therapy in comparison with stereotactic photon radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy remains to be defined through future clinical trials

Between September 1988 and December 1997 a total of 973 patients (26,916 fields) had been treated on the 66 MeV p+Be isocentric neutron therapy system. Patients are currently being treated according to several protocols, including tumors of the head and neck, salivary gland and breast and soft tissue sarcomas, uterine sarcomas and paranasal sinuses. A multiblade post-collimator trimmer has recently being installed. This device provides improved neutron beam shaping capability. Between September 1993 and December 1997 a total of 243 patients (4008 fields) had been treated (mainly intracranial stereotactic irradiations) on the fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton therapy facility. The facility incorporates an innovative automatic patient positioning system. Two new fixed beam lines for proton therapy are presently being designed (horizontal and 30 degrees to the vertical) for an existing unused treatment vault. Spot scanning systems will be developed for both beam lines

We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone

We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone

On the basis of its histopathology, the tumor must be classified as a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The latest data in the literature give cause for a little more optimism thanks to the introduction of the most recent schemes of chemotherapy combined with large-dose radiation for consolidation. Our patient was treated with chemotherapy CHOP high-dose radiation which resulted in complete disappearance of the mediastinal mass and rapid remission of the severe symptoms of mediastinal compression. After about 30 months, instrumental and laboratory findings confirm the persistence of the complete remission

METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe, brain stem, thalamus, or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment. The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient. Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high. Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution. One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin. The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a helium-ion particle beam. The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents. The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous malformations. RESULTS: One irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult. This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of helium-ion radiosurgery. Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately. Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations, six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels, fibrinoid necrosis, and ferrugination. However, the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls. All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels; none were completely thrombosed. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years (mean 3.5 yr) after radiation delivery. It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients. However, recurrent bleeding from AOVMs may relate to poor radiation response in some patients

1	4490	Irradiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors: analysis by positron emission tomography and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy	Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast, Cell Differentiation/ph [Physiology], Female, Humans, Japan, Lung, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Effects, Radiation Injuries, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Universities	To evaluate irradiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors treated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery, positron emission tomography (PET) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies were performed on five patients. The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury

The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months.

Surgery and chemotherapy have also been used either before, after, or during radiation therapy, aiming at further improvement of local control of cancer. Intraoperative irradiation, which was firstly developed in Japan, has been applied for treatment of cancers arising from stomach, pancreas and the tumors requiring further improvement of dose distributions in the target volume. Particle radiation therapy using fast neutrons and protons is in under clinical trial in order to evaluate the role of dose distribution as well as biological effect in radiation therapy influencing upon local control of the tumor

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in 78 patients who underwent MR spectroscopy for evaluation of a focal brain mass suspected of being neoplastic. MR spectroscopic findings were positive for neoplasm in 49 patients and negative in 29. Treatment with or without performance of biopsy was noted. In patients with positive findings who underwent irradiation or chemotherapy without biopsy and in patients with negative findings who were treated medically or followed up for interval changes, MR spectroscopy was classified as having a potential positive influence on treatment. In patients with positive findings with subsequently proved nonneoplastic lesions and in patients with negative findings with subsequently proved tumors, MR spectroscopy was classified as having a potential negative influence. RESULTS: MR spectroscopy in eight (16%) patients with positive findings and in 15 (52%) patients with negative findings had a potential positive influence on treatment. In two (3%) patients, MR spectroscopy had a potential negative influence. CONCLUSION: MR spectroscopy may play a beneficial role in the management of suspected brain tumors. Prospective studies are needed to test the effect of MR spectroscopy on clinical practice and to measure costs and benefits

The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis.

In most cases a single dose of stereotactic irradiation effects the reduction of the tumor volume in a few days. External whole brain and, in two cases, spinal irradiation completed the treatment to avoid seeding of tumor cells. The technique and the advantages of this original therapeutical approach to intracranial germinomas are described and discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred seventeen eligible patients were randomly allocated to either photon or pion therapy. No adjuvant hormone therapy was used. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 42 months (range 2-90). Acute bladder toxicity was worse in the pion arm, p = 0.2, but other acute toxicity did not differ. Late grade 2 toxicity was significantly less in the pion arm (29% at 5 years versus 48%, p = 0.002), but late grade 3 or 4 toxicity did not differ. Clinical local control was not significantly different between treatment arms (64% after 5 years with photons, 56% with pions, p = 0.6). Cause-specific and overall survival also did not differ (p = 0.7). There was a significant delay in time to first failure in the photon arm, largely as a result of decreased biochemical relapse, p = 0.01. A multivariate analysis is presented. CONCLUSION: Pion therapy was well tolerated, with increased acute toxicity and significantly decreased late tissue injury. This contrasts with the late toxicity observed with higher LET particle therapy such as neutron therapy. No improvement in local control with pion therapy was observed

Xerostomia is a serious, permanent, and ubiquitous sequelae in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This study was designed to investigate the severity of xerostomia and its impact on the quality of life in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated by conventional radiation therapy in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, were surveyed by interview at the outpatient. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analysis of xerostomia and xerostomia-related problems. RESULTS: Of 136 patents, 73.5% of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. 82.4% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate speech; 92.6% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate chewing and swallowing; 91.2% of the patients changed their feeding pattern (can eat only mashed food); 61.3% of the patients had to wake up to drink water because of dry mouth; 75.0% of the patients had teeth deteriorated. CONCLUSION: 73.5% of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. Xerostomia has a significant impact on the patient's speech, deglutition, sleep, and increases the morbidity rate of the tooth

We discuss issues related to the statistical analysis of Monte Carlo dose calculations for realistic clinical beams using various variance reduction or time saving techniques. We discuss the effect of statistical uncertainties on dose prescription and monitor unit calculation for conventional treatment and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show the effect of statistical uncertainties on beamlet dose calculation and plan optimization for IMRT and other advanced treatment techniques such as modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT). We provide practical guidelines for the clinical implementation of Monte Carlo treatment planning and show realistic examples of Monte Carlo based IMRT and MERT plans

This is the first trial to investigate the utility of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the imaging of chordoma before and after carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with chordoma were investigated with MET-PET before and after CIRT and the findings analyzed visually and quantitatively. Tumor MET uptake was evaluated by tumor-to-nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). RESULTS: In 12 (80%) patients chordoma was clearly visible in the baseline MET-PET study with a mean T/N ratio of 3.3+/-1.7. The MET uptake decreased significantly to 2.3+/-1.4 after CIRT ( P<0.05). A significant reduction in tumor MET uptake of 24% was observed after CIRT. Fourteen (93%) patients showed no local recurrence after CIRT with a median follow-up time of 20 months. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that MET-PET is feasible for imaging of chordoma. MET-PET could provide important tumor metabolic information for the therapeutic monitoring of chordoma after CIRT

To establish heavy ion therapy for prostate cancer, three trials have been conducted. For 247 patients with T1b-T3 cancer, carbon ion beam was irradiated 20 times/5 weeks with or without endocrine therapy. Overall and cause-specific survivals were excellent and local control was achieved in all patients except one. Grade 3 late morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra was developed in 7 cases who received higher dose. Thus, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment. In conclusion, carbon ion therapy is expected to exert excellent effect in the treatment of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. [References: 19]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors

Over the past twelve months at this institution, we have developed devices and techniques to obtain precise and reproducible electron therapy treatments. These devices and methods have been used in the treatment of irregularly shaped fields for areas of complex shape, or those adjacent to critical or radiosensitive tissues and areas where it has been cosmetically unsuitable for patients to carry treatment field markings. This paper describes the techniques used in six representative cases with due consideration to physics, dosimetry and practical aspects. Several recommendations result from our experiences here

[French]	Biopsy, Brachytherapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: We conducted a retrospective study on the clinical factors influencing the local and general prognosis of patients treated for uveal melanoma with a preliminary analysis of the prognostic value of monosomy 3. PATIENTS: and method: The patients sent to Curie Institute for uveal melanoma have a complete initial clinical evaluation, conservative management by radiotherapy or enucleation, and local and general long-term follow-up. Over the last 5 years, the status of chromosome 3 has been assessed by FISH in the tumors of enucleated patients. Findings concerning the initial workup, treatment, and follow-up are recorded prospectively. We conducted a retrospective study with multivariate analysis of the clinical factors influencing local recurrence, ocular conservation metastasis, and survival and studied the effect of monosomy 3. RESULTS: A total of 2241 patients were registered with a median follow-up of 72 months. Of these patients, 92.8% had conservative management with iodine 125 brachytherapy or proton beam therapy and 7.2% of the patients had enucleation (n=160). Tumors from 120 patients were studied for the status of chromosome 3 by FISH. The overall survival rate was 76.3% and the metastatic rate was 19.5%. The clinical factors influencing survival were the size and location of the tumor, age of the patient, gender, and initial treatment. The factors influencing the metastatic risk were the same plus retinal detachment and local recurrence. Monosomy 3 was a significant risk factor for metastatic disease. DISCUSSION: This study found the usual risk factors with the difference that location on the equator seems to be of worse prognosis than ciliary body involvement for survival and metastasis. In addition, the initial retinal detachment appears to be a risk factor for local recurrence and metastasis. At present, the evaluation of chromosome 3 is available for enucleated tumors but it could probably be done on needle biopsy performed during conservative management as well. CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous results on the prognostic factors of uveal melanoma and on the value of monosomy 3. The increasingly precise identification of a group of high-risk patients should allow us to propose adjuvant therapy and to adapt follow-up

Left ventricular myocardium of victims of accidents without cardiovascular pathology was studied as control. Compared with control dysbalance of various degree was noted in left ventricular myocardium of patients with ischemic heart disease. Four groups of microelements were distinguished: lowered content (Se, Rb, K); close to normal content (Mn, Cu); moderately elevated content (Cr, Sr, Fe); elevated content (Ni, Zn). Several orders of magnitude elevation of Ni and Zn was noted in all parts of left ventricle, especially in the zone of infarction and periinfarction zone

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with medication refractory idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia were treated with a single fraction of 80 Gy to the trigeminal nerve root. For treatment delivery, a 4-mm collimator and a 7-arc technique were delivered using a stereotactic floor stand system with an isocenter stability of 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm to minimize dose to the brainstem. Treatment delivery time was approximately 55 minutes. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 1-40 mo), 57% of patients achieved complete pain relief and 75% (exact 95% confidence interval, 55 to 89%) had their pain reduced to 3 or less on a 10-point pain scale. Median time to pain relief was 1 month. Four patients did not respond to treatment. The actuarial mean time to pain recurrence in responders was 14 months, and the actuarial mean response duration in major to complete responders was 16 months. Women had significantly longer mean time to pain recurrence than men (16 versus 7 months; P = 0.05). Three patients reported new mild facial numbness after radiosurgery and one patient developed neurotrophic keratopathy.

Protons, neutrons, pions, boron-neutron capture therapy, and charged-nuclei therapy (with argon, carbon, helium [alpha particles], neon, nitrogen, and silicon) have been assessed for their physical, biological, and clinical effects. In the 90 years since protons and neutrons were discovered, investigations of particle therapy for cancer have helped to elucidate many fundamental radiobiological ideas, such as linear energy transfer, relative biological effectiveness, oxygen effect, and oxygen enhancement. Particle therapy has contributed to our understanding of medical ethics when neutron therapy became intertwined with the debate over standards of informed consent in radiation experiments in humans during the cold war era. Particle teletherapy and brachytherapy continue to show promise in some clinical situations. In the future, the insights of molecular biology might clarify the ideal particles for clinical situations

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred twenty patients with carcinoma of the cervix were treated by primary radiotherapy between 1991 and 1998. The median age was 63 (range 24-84). The distribution according to Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was as follows: Stage IB, 11.4%; IIA, 9.1%; IIB, 50.9%; IIIA, 3.6%; IIIB, 23.2%; and IVA, 1.8%. They were treated with whole pelvic irradiation giving 40 Gy to the midplane in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. This was followed by parametrial irradiation, giving 16-20 Gy in 8-10 fractions. HDR intracavitary brachytherapy was given weekly, with a dose of 7 Gy to point A for three fractions and, starting from 1996, 6 Gy weekly for four fractions. The median overall treatment time was 50 days (range 42-73 days). The median follow-up time was 4.7 years (range 3 months to 11.1 years). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The complete remission rate after radiotherapy was 93.4% (211/226). The 5-year actuarial failure-free survival (FFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates for stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA were 87.7% and 86.6%, 85% and 85%, 67.8% and 74%, 46.9% and 54.7%, 44.8% and 50.4%, 0% and 25%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, young age (< 50) (p = 0.0054), adenocarcinoma (p = 0.0384), and stage (p = 0.0005) were found to be independent poor prognostic factors. The 5-year actuarial major complication rates (Grade 3 or above) were as follows: proctitis, 1.0%; cystitis, 0.5%; enteritis, 1.3%; and overall, 2.8%. On multivariate analysis, history of pelvic surgery was a significant prognosticator. The two HDR fractionation schedules were not a significant prognosticator in predicting disease control and complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience in treating cervical cancer with HDR intracavitary brachytherapy is encouraging. Our treatment results and complication rates were compatible with those of the LDR series. Further studies are eagerly awaited to better define the optimal fractionation schedule for HDR brachytherapy and the schedule on how chemotherapy may be combined with it. [References: 41]

DESIGN: Longitudinal survey design with descriptive, correlational, and comparative elements. SETTING: A tertiary medical center and associated clinics in a suburban community in the Southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 185 men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled from five treatment groups: watchful waiting (n = 30), surgery (n = 59), conventional radiation (n = 25), proton-beam radiation (n = 24), and a combination of conventional radiation and proton-beam radiation or mixed-beam radiation (n = 47). At six months, 163 remained on the study; at 12 months, 154 remained: and at 18 months, 153 remained. The average age was 68 years, and 82% of the men were white. METHODS: Men were enrolled at treatment and given a questionnaire with a self-addressed, stamped envelope for return. Questionnaires were mailed again at 6, 12, and 18 months. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Health-related QOL health status, prostate treatment-specific symptoms, and sex-role identity. FINDINGS: No overall difference in health-related QOL or health status was found, but post-hoc analysis revealed specific differences. The differences existed in sexual functioning and gastrointestinal treatment-specific symptoms. No relationship existed between masculinity and health-related QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related QOL and health status are similar regardless of type of treatment. Radiation tends to produce more gastrointestinal symptoms, and surgery tends to produce more sexual functioning symptoms. Watchful waiting is associated with poorer general health. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses can provide specific treatment-related information to men who are faced with making treatment decisions for prostate cancer and, in consultation with the healthcare team, can select a treatment best sulted to them

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, a total of 85 patients with vascular lesions have been treated. Of those, 64 patients fulfilled the criteria of having an arteriovenous malformation and sufficient follow-up. The AVMs were grouped by volume: <14 cc (26 patients) and > or =14 cc (38 patients). Treatment was delivered with a fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton beam under stereotactic conditions, using a stereophotogrammetric positioning system. The majority of patients were hypofractionated (2 or 3 fractions), and the proton doses are presented as single-fraction equivalent cobalt Gray equivalent doses (SFEcGyE). The overall mean minimum target volume dose was 17.37 SFEcGyE, ranging from 10.38-22.05 SFEcGyE. RESULTS: Analysis by volume group showed obliteration in 67% for volumes <14 cc and 43% for volumes > or =14 cc. Grade IV acute complications were observed in 3% of patients. Transient delayed effects were seen in 15 patients (23%), becoming permanent in 3 patients. One patient also developed a cyst 8 years after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic proton beam therapy applied in a hypofractionated schedule allows for the safe treatment of large AVMs, with acceptable results. It is an alternative to other treatment strategies for large AVMs. AVMs are likely not static entities, but probably undergo vascular remodeling. Factors influencing angiogenesis could play a new role in a form of adjuvant therapy to improve on the radiosurgical results

Of those, 64 patients fulfilled the criteria of having an arteriovenous malformation and sufficient follow-up. The AVMs were grouped by volume: <14 cc (26 patients) and > or =14 cc (38 patients). Treatment was delivered with a fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton beam under stereotactic conditions, using a stereophotogrammetric positioning system. The majority of patients were hypofractionated (2 or 3 fractions), and the proton doses are presented as single-fraction equivalent cobalt Gray equivalent doses (SFEcGyE). The overall mean minimum target volume dose was 17.37 SFEcGyE, ranging from 10.38-22.05 SFEcGyE. RESULTS: Analysis by volume group showed obliteration in 67% for volumes <14 cc and 43% for volumes > or =14 cc. Grade IV acute complications were observed in 3% of patients. Transient delayed effects were seen in 15 patients (23%), becoming permanent in 3 patients. One patient also developed a cyst 8 years after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic proton beam therapy applied in a hypofractionated schedule allows for the safe treatment of large AVMs, with acceptable results. It is an alternative to other treatment strategies for large AVMs. AVMs are likely not static entities, but probably undergo vascular remodeling. Factors influencing angiogenesis could play a new role in a form of adjuvant therapy to improve on the radiosurgical results

0	1331	Tumor location, cirrhosis, and surgical history contribute to tumor movement in the liver, as measured during stereotactic irradiation using a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system	Computer Systems, Fluoroscopy, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Hepatectomy, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Liver Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) intrafractional motion of liver tumors during real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 20 patients with liver tumors were analyzed. Before treatment, a 2-mm gold marker was implanted near the tumor. The RTRT system used fluoroscopy image processor units to determine the 3D position of the implanted marker. A linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker was located within a permitted region. The automatically recorded tumor-motion data were analyzed to determine the amplitude of the tumor motion, curve shape of the tumor motion, treatment efficiency, frequency of movement, and hysteresis. Each of the following clinical factors was evaluated to determine its contribution to the amplitude of movement: tumor position, existence of cirrhosis, surgical history, tumor volume, and distance between the isocenter and the marker. RESULTS: The average amplitude of tumor motion in the 20 patients was 4 +/- 4 mm (range 1-12), 9 +/- 5 mm (range 2-19), and 5 +/- 3 mm (range 2-12) in the left-right, craniocaudal, and anterior-posterior (AP) direction, respectively. The tumor motion of the right lobe was significantly larger than that of the left lobe in the left-right and AP directions (p = 0.01). The tumor motion of the patients with liver cirrhosis was significantly larger than that of the patients without liver cirrhosis in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.004). The tumor motion of the patients who had received partial hepatectomy was significantly smaller than that of the patients who had no history of any operation on the liver in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.03). Thus, three of the five clinical factors examined (i.e., tumor position in the liver, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver) significantly affected the tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction during stereotactic irradiation. Frequency analysis revealed that for 9 (45%) of the 20 tumors, the cardiac beat caused measurable motion. The 3D trajectory of the tumor showed hysteresis for 4 (20%) of the 20 tumors. The average treatment efficiency of RTRT was 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver all had an impact on the intrafractional tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction. This finding should be helpful in determining the smallest possible margin in individual cases of radiotherapy for liver malignancy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the period from 1977 to 1992, 223 patients were irradiated with charged particles at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for tumors either arising in or extending to the skull base, of whom 48 (22%) had recurrent lesions, either post previous surgery or radiotherapy. One hundred twenty-six patients had lesions arising in the cranial base, mostly chordoma (53), chondrosarcoma (27), paraclival meningioma (27) with 19 patients having other histologies such as osteosarcoma or neurofibrosarcoma. There were also 31 patients with primary or recurrent squamous carcinoma of the nasopharynx extending to the skull base, 44 patients with major or minor salivary gland tumors, mostly adenocarcinoma, and 22 patients with squamous carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses, all with cranial base extension. RESULTS: Local control and survival appeared improved in tumors arising in the skull base, following the ability with charged particles to deliver high doses (mean of 65 Gy-equivalent) with relative sparing of the adjacent normal tissues. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year local control was 85% for meningioma, 78% for chondrosarcoma, 63% for chordoma and 58% for other sarcoma. Follow-up ranged from 4-191 months with a median of 51 months. CONCLUSION: Charged particle radiotherapy is highly effective in controlling cranial base lesions which have have been partially resected. Better tumor localization with CT and MRI, improved 3-D treatment planning and beam delivery techniques have continued to reduce the level of serious complications and increase local control and survival.

The tumour dose ranged between 6 and 12 Gy and was limited by the low dose penetration of the neutron beam. A local control rate of 66% was obtained. The local control was affected by the tumour differentiation, residual status and histological subtype. Severe fibrosis of the subcutaneous tissues occurred in 40% usually after 2 years. No serious general side effects occurred. To optimize neutron therapy, a high energy clinically-based cyclotron with a fully rotational gantry and a multileaf collimator should be utilized.

To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands	
1	4713	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry of the head and neck: a comparison of treatment plans using linear accelerator-based IMRT and helical tomotherapy	Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Methods, Neck, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Gland, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography,Spiral Computed/mt [Methods], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	PURPOSE: To date, most intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery has occurred using linear accelerators (linacs), although helical tomotherapy has become commercially available. To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%.

CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

The study of tumors attributable to high LET irradiation would greatly augment our insights into the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Chronic low-dose-rate internal exposure to alpha-radiation from thorium dioxide deposits following intravascular administration of the radiographic contrast agent Thorotrast is known to markedly increase the risk of cancer development, especially that of hepatic angiosarcomas and cholangiocarcinomas. Although the mechanism is hypothesized to be via cellular damage, DNA being a major target, wrought by the high LET alpha-particles, the specific genes and the actual sequence of events involved in the process of transforming a normal cell into a malignant one are largely unknown. To shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of cancer development during a lifetime exposure to alpha-radiation, we analyzed the most commonly affected tumor suppressor gene in humans, p53, in 20 Thorotrast recipients who developed cancer, mostly of hepatic bile duct and blood vessel origin. Of the 20 cases, 19 were found to harbor p53 point mutations. Moreover, the accompanying non-tumor tissues from these patients also had p53 mutations, albeit at lower frequency. The distribution pattern of the point mutations was significantly different between the non-tumor and tumor tissues, with most mutations in malignant tissues located in the highly conserved domains of the p53 gene. Our results support the idea that p53 mutations are important in the genesis of Thorotrast-induced tumors but that these point mutations are a secondary outcome of genomic instability induced by the irradiation. Additionally, non-tumor cells harboring p53 mutations may gain some survival advantage in situ but mutations in the domains responsible for the formation of structural elements critical in binding DNA may be necessary for a cell to reach full malignancy

0	3789	A model for calculating the effects of small inhomogeneities on electron beam dose distributions	Air, Humans, Motion, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Solutions	Charged particles penetrating a medium are repeatedly deflected from their line of motion by coulomb interactions with target nuclei. This physical feature should be included in the calculation of dose distributions when the irradiated medium contains small inhomogeneities. We use the mean path taken by particles in homogeneous media to represent their motion through inhomogeneous materials. This procedure adapts wht small angle multiple scattering formalism to yield manageable, approximate solutions when a medium contains arbitrarily composed inhomogeneities. To promote the development of this procedure into an electron beam treatment planning program, we discuss the salient features which arise in connection with electron beam inhomogeneity calculations. We use a solid phantom containing an air cavity just below its surface as a particular example of a small inhomogeneity. We discuss qualitatively and quantitatively the dose distributions which result from their irradiation with an 11-MeV electron beam

To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

0	758	Estimation of the dose to the nursing infant due to direct irradiation from activity present in maternal organs and tissues	Adult, Body Burden, Brazil, Breast, Breast Feeding, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Linear Energy Transfer/ph [Physiology], Liver, Lung, Maternal Exposure, Monte Carlo Method, Organ Specificity, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/an [Analysis], Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Whole-Body Counting/mt [Methods]	Radionuclides deposited internally in the mother will give rise to a radiation dose in the infant in two ways. The radionuclides may be transferred through milk and give rise to an internal dose in the infant, or the radionuclides may emit photons that are absorbed by the infant, giving rise to an external dose. In this paper, the external dose to the newborn infant caused by direct irradiation was estimated for monoenergetic photons. Voxel models (also called voxel phantoms) of the mother and infant were made in three geometries. These models, consisting of volume elements, or voxels, were designed so that the infant model was placed in the lap, at the breast and on the shoulder of the mother model. The Visual Monte Carlo (VMC) code was used to transport the photons through the voxel models. Source regions for the emitted photons, such as the whole body, the thyroid, the lung, the liver and the skeleton, were chosen. For the validation of the calculation procedure, VMC results were favourably compared with the results obtained by using other Monte Carlo programs and also with the previously published results for specific absorbed fractions. This paper provides estimates of the external dose per photon to the infant for photon energies between 0.05 and 2.5 MeV. The external dose per photon estimates were made for the three geometries and for the sources listed above. The results show that, for the geometry of the nursing infant model at the breast, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited in the mother's liver. For the nursing infant model at the shoulder, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited in the mother's thyroid, and for the nursing infant model in the lap, the highest dose to the infant per photon comes from radionuclides deposited uniformly in the whole body. The dose per photon results were then used to estimate the dose an infant might receive over the lactation period (6 months) due to the incorporation of 1 Bq of a radionuclide by the mother. This information may be used to provide external dose estimates to the infant in the case of a known or suspected radionuclide incorporation by the mother due to, for example, a nuclear medicine procedure

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 65 women (age 25-70 years, mean 47 years) with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB were initially treated with external beam radiotherapy on a telecobalt or 6 MV linear accelerator to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 5-6 weeks. After 2-3 weeks of completing external radiation, patients received interstitial brachytherapy with Iridium-192 (activity 0.5-1 mCi/cm) using a Syed-Neblett perineal template. The median dose delivered to the implant volume was 24 Gy (range 20-32 Gy) delivered at an average dose rate of 0.70 Gy/h (range 0.40-1.20 Gy/h). A point defined at 1.5 cm lateral to the central uterine tandem at the level of os was taken as a representative for assessing the dose to the cervix. Mean doses delivered by interstitial brachytherapy to point A, cervix, point B and rectum were 38 Gy, 34 Gy, 16 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 53 months, the actuarial disease free survival and overall survival for 65 patients at both 5 and 10 years was 64% and 44%, respectively. Response to radiotherapy was a strong predictor of local control with 82% of patients continuing to have pelvic control after initial complete response. Overall, nine (14%) patients had persistent disease, ten (15%) developed a central recurrence after initial control and three patients developed distant metastasis on follow-up. No patient had any immediate treatment-related complication. Late toxicity included grade I-II rectal reactions in five patients and grade IV bladder complication (vesico-vaginal fistula) in two patients. 5 years after treatment, one patient developed intestinal obstruction, which was relieved after conservative management. Two patients developed vaginal stenosis. The 5- and 10-year disease free survival was 48% in patients aged less than 45 years as compared to 80% in patients of more than 45 years (p = 0.009). Dose to the cervical point was a prognostic indicator with 5- and 10-year disease free survival of 47% in patients who received < 35 Gy in comparison to 80% in patients who had > 35 Gy (p = 0.03). There was no difference in local control and survival in patients with minimal and moderate parametrial involvement. Bulky disease (> 4 cm) at presentation and a longer gap between external radiation and brachytherapy showed a trend towards inferior local control. CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial brachytherapy after external beam irradiation in patients with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB results in acceptable local control, survival and complication rates. Increased dose to the cervical disease results in improved local control and survival and should therefore be considered while optimizing brachytherapy treatment plans. Comparison of the results with those of standard intracavitary therapy remains to be proven in a randomized trial

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 65 women (age 25-70 years, mean 47 years) with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB were initially treated with external beam radiotherapy on a telecobalt or 6 MV linear accelerator to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 5-6 weeks. After 2-3 weeks of completing external radiation, patients received interstitial brachytherapy with Iridium-192 (activity 0.5-1 mCi/cm) using a Syed-Neblett perineal template. The median dose delivered to the implant volume was 24 Gy (range 20-32 Gy) delivered at an average dose rate of 0.70 Gy/h (range 0.40-1.20 Gy/h). A point defined at 1.5 cm lateral to the central uterine tandem at the level of os was taken as a representative for assessing the dose to the cervix. Mean doses delivered by interstitial brachytherapy to point A, cervix, point B and rectum were 38 Gy, 34 Gy, 16 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 53 months, the actuarial disease free survival and overall survival for 65 patients at both 5 and 10 years was 64% and 44%, respectively. Response to radiotherapy was a strong predictor of local control with 82% of patients continuing to have pelvic control after initial complete response. Overall, nine (14%) patients had persistent disease, ten (15%) developed a central recurrence after initial control and three patients developed distant metastasis on follow-up. No patient had any immediate treatment-related complication. Late toxicity included grade I-II rectal reactions in five patients and grade IV bladder complication (vesico-vaginal fistula) in two patients. 5 years after treatment, one patient developed intestinal obstruction, which was relieved after conservative management.

In all cases the diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory data, as well as radiographic images. Ten patients with false-negative CT scans had MRI confirming the presence of microadenomas less than 5 mm in size. The majority of patients (n = 51) were operated via transsphenoidal approach, transcranial route was utilized in 2 cases. Among the pathological findings, corticotropinomas were revealed in 49 cases, 4 patients were considered to have hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary without well demarcated adenoma. All patients were divided into 2 groups based on the history of previous treatment. Group 1 included 37 primary patients who had not been treated before admission. Group 2 included 16 patients treated surgically (e.g. neurosurgical operations, bilateral/unilateral adrenalectomy), or with irradiation therapy, including proton beam irradiation prior to admission. We came to conclusion that the following principles were essential in the management of Cushing's disease. 1. Properly interpreted clinical signs and symptoms along with biochemical data and radiographic imaging (including MRI) are extremely helpful in the preoperative evaluation of such patients. Our approach helped us reveal corticotropinomas with 98% accuracy. 2. Microsurgical removal was proved to be effective in up to 83% of patients, which was demonstrated by clinical and biochemical remission. 3. It should be emphasized that the results of treatment were significantly better in the first group versus the second one. In group 1, remission was reached in 91.1% of patients as compared to 62.5% in Group 2. 4. In primary patients, the trauma associated with surgical procedure is less and tumors demonstrate a less aggressive biological behavior

Among 4401 3-year survivors of a childhood cancer in eight French and British centres and 25120 patients younger than 20 years old at first malignant neoplasm (FMN) extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, 16 patients developed a melanoma as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). A cohort study of the French and British cohorts was performed. In a nested case-control study, the 16 patients who developed a melanoma as a SMN (cases) were matched with 3-5 controls in their respective cohort according to gender, age at the first cancer, the calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer and follow-up. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of melanoma for local doses >15 Gy, Odds Ratio (OR)=13 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.94-174). Regarding chemotherapy, we observed an increased OR for both alkylating agents and spindle inhibitors, OR=2.7 (95% CI: 0.5-14). Children treated for a gonadal tumour as a FMN were found to be at a higher risk of melanoma, OR=8.7 (95% CI: 0.9-86). The adjusted OR for the local radiation dose was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00-1.15). In conclusion, radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk of melanoma as a SMN, but only at very high doses of low linear energy transfer radiation.

Regarding chemotherapy, we observed an increased OR for both alkylating agents and spindle inhibitors, OR=2.7 (95% CI: 0.5-14). Children treated for a gonadal tumour as a FMN were found to be at a higher risk of melanoma, OR=8.7 (95% CI: 0.9-86). The adjusted OR for the local radiation dose was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00-1.15). In conclusion, radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk of melanoma as a SMN, but only at very high doses of low linear energy transfer radiation. Common genetic origins between gonadal tumours and malignant melanomas are likely

Among 4401 3-year survivors of a childhood cancer in eight French and British centres and 25120 patients younger than 20 years old at first malignant neoplasm (FMN) extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, 16 patients developed a melanoma as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). A cohort study of the French and British cohorts was performed. In a nested case-control study, the 16 patients who developed a melanoma as a SMN (cases) were matched with 3-5 controls in their respective cohort according to gender, age at the first cancer, the calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer and follow-up. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of melanoma for local doses >15 Gy, Odds Ratio (OR)=13 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.94-174).

METHODS: Twenty patients with multiple brain metastases not having received any previous brain radiation were selected for the study. The total radiation dose varied from 40 (20 fractions) to 50 (25 fractions) Gy, with an opposition technique. MRS was performed just before irradiation, during the acute phase (n = 20, 8.5 +/- 4.6 days) and in the early delayed phase (n = 15, 3.6 +/- 0.5 months) after radiation. The concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), choline-containing substance (Cho), and creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) was quantified. RESULTS: The concentration of NAA decreased (P = 0.05 versus before radiation), and the concentration of Cho increased (P = 0.006 versus before radiation) during the early delayed phase. The concentration of Cr was not changed before or after radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced changes in brain metabolism were well detected with quantitative MRS in the early delayed phase. Quantitative MRS is a novel tool for estimating radiation-induced neurotoxicity

Chondroid mineralisation, a histological feature of chondrosarcoma, can be recognised on CT and is, together with the off-midline position of the tumour, the most characteristic finding. Differentiation is usually made by histological and immunocytochemical staining. Surgery, proton radiation therapy and stereotactic single high-dose irradiation have been used to treat patients with chondrosarcoma. It is worth mentioning that it was likely that the chondrosarcoma in our patient represented a malignant degeneration of an enchondroma that had been resected 30 years earlier

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation

We retrospectively analyzed patients with brain metastases of malignant melanoma who were treated at our institution for outcome and prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 64 patients with 122 cerebral metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery between 1986 and 2000. Twelve patients (19%) showed neurologic symptoms at the time of treatment, and 46 patients (72%) had extracerebral tumor manifestation at that time. The median dose to the 80% isodose line, prescribed to encompass the tumor margin, was 20 Gy (range, 15-22 Gy). RESULTS: Neurologic symptoms improved in five of twelve symptomatic patients. 41 patients remained asymptomatic or unchanged in their neurologic symptoms. Only five patients (8%) temporarily worsened neurologically after therapy despite no signs of tumor progression. With a mean follow-up time of 9.4 months, actuarial local control was 81% after 1 year. There was a statistically significant dose and size dependency of local tumor control. Median actuarial survival after treatment was 10.6 months. Patients without extracerebral tumor manifestation showed a superior survival (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high local tumor control rates, the prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases of malignant melanoma remains poor. Stereotactic radiosurgery has the potential of stabilizing or improving neurologic symptoms in these patients in a palliative setting

The system comprises a compact diagnostic X-ray unit mounted on the accelerator head, with its source in the isocentric plane exactly 37 degrees around from the therapy source. The image detector is an image intensifier with digital image storage/processing facilities. Images were taken at the accelerator of treatment fields in seven patients (pelvic, head and neck, chest fields) and these images were comparable in anatomical contrast to simulator radiographs. Two techniques for marking the therapy field onto the portal images were successfully demonstrated. One was to mark relevant corners or edges of the therapy light field on the skin using small Pb markers which become clearly visible in the 'diagnostic' portal image. The other was to record a separate 'therapy' image and through the software, extract and superimpose the field edges on to the 'diagnostic' image. The system and method proved fundamentally sound on criteria of image quality, geometric precision of rotation between therapy and imaging conditions, and its potential for development as a practical clinical tool

DESIGN: Noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a series of 63 patients (76 eyes) with choroidal metastases treated with proton beam therapy between December 1989 and September 2000. METHODS: Patients were treated with 2 fractions of 14 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) (CGE = proton Gy x relative biological effectiveness 1.1), each using a nonoperative "light-field" technique. Ophthalmologic follow-up was available for 46 patients (55 eyes), with a mean follow-up time of 10 months. The medical record or the Social Security Death Index was used to obtain survival status, which was available in 94% of cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor regression, recurrence, treatment-associated complications, and visual acuity were evaluated by ophthalmologic examination and ultrasonography. Eye retention and length of survival also were assessed. RESULTS: At the time of ocular diagnosis, 49 patients reported a history of a primary cancer. Median survival time after ocular diagnosis was 16 months through May 2003. Most choroidal metastases were dome shaped (62%) and located at the posterior pole (95%). Mean tumor height was approximately 3.5 mm, and serous retinal detachment was seen in 63% of cases. Eighty-four percent of treated tumors regressed completely within 5 months of treatment, and none of these recurred. Retinal detachment resolved in 82% of patients within 3.8 months after treatment, and visual acuity was preserved or improved in 47% of the patients. Complications occurred in 56% of cases and included madarosis, keratitis, dry eye syndrome, cataract, neovascular glaucoma, chorioretinal atrophy, radiation papillopathy, and radiation maculopathy. None of the treated eyes required enucleation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation is a useful therapeutic approach for choroidal metastases; it allows retention of the globe, achieves a high probability of local tumor control, and helps to avoid pain and visual loss. Although complications occur in most cases, many of these are minor and are not associated with a change in function. This modality is accurate and efficient, because it only entails 2 treatment fractions and does not require surgery for tumor localization

0	30	Combined hyperfractionated radiotherapy and protracted infusion chemotherapy in bladder cancer for organ preservation	Adult, Aged, Antimetabolites,Antineoplastic/ad [Administration & Dosage], Combined Modality Therapy, Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Female, Fluorouracil/ad [Administration & Dosage], Humans, Infusions,Intravenous, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Time Factors, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: To test an innovative schedule of concurrent protracted intravenous infusion (PVI) of cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) with organ-sparing intent in bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (pts) were selected to receive an aggressive TURB followed by 2 MCV cycles, and HFRT with concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (33 pts) or HFRT and concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (20 pts). The 5-FU and CDDP doses ranged from 180 to 220 mg/sm/day and from 4 to 6 mg/sm/day, respectively. Radiotherapy was delivered as three 100 cGy fraction per day or two 150 cGy fraction per day to a total dose of 50 Gy to the pelvis and a 20 Gy boost to the bladder. RESULTS: Grade III toxicity in pts who received or not MCV was: rectal tenesmus 12/33 and 0/20, dysuria 6/33 and 4/20, leukopenia 3/33 and 0/20, thrombocytopenia 7/33 and 1/20 pts, respectively. A Grade IV toxicity was observed in 2 pts. Of the 28 evaluable patients treated with MCV, CR were observed in 23 (82%) and PR in 5 cases. Of the 18 evaluable patients treated without MCV, CR were observed in 18 cases (100%). Actually, 65% and 14% of the CR pts treated with or without HCV are alive and free of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This bladder-sparing treatment shows an acceptable acute and late toxicity, similar to that observed with radiotherapy alone. The high CRs and bladder preservation rates observed deserve further clinical evaluation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions. RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an alpha/beta value of 3.7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated. CONCLUSION: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since January 1990, 97 patients with locally advanced carcinomas of the naso-, oro-, hypopharynx and the oral cavity in UICC stages III and IV were treated according to an accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy schedule with concurrent chemotherapy. The primary tumor and positive lymph nodes received a total dose of 72 Gy in 6 weeks. In the first 3 weeks, large fields were irradiated 5 times per week with 2 Gy per fraction. Thereafter, treatment was accelerated, giving 2 daily fractions of 1.4 Gy with minimal intervals of 6 hours. Target volumes were reduced after 49.6 and 59.4 Gy, excluding clinically uninvolved lymph node regions of low and high risk. On day 1, 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 50 mg/m2 folinic acid were given as intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion of 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 100 mg/m2 folinic acid, days 1 to 5. 10 mg/m2 mitomycin C was given on day 5 and 36 of the treatment. Salvage surgery was offered for residual disease 5 to 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Patient characteristics: 70 male, 27 female; age: 27 to 81 years; T2/T3/T4: 7/30/60; N0/N1/N2/N3: 20/18/53/6; nasopharynx/oropharynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity: 16/33/36/12. Median follow-up is 26 months. RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were 68 +/- 5% and 74 +/- 5%. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant influence of the geometric mean neck node diameter or the N-stage on loco-regional control and survival. T-stage, tumor volume, or tumor localisation did not become significant. Acute toxicity of this schedule was acceptable but required optimised supportive care. Treatment related grade 4+ late toxicity of mucosa, soft tissue and bone were observed with a cumulative frequency of 13% at 2 years. Two patients died during a phase of severe leuko- or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: This phase I to II trial shows favourable results using an intensified treatment radio-chemotherapy protocol. A phase III study is now planned, comparing this regime with an accelerated hyperfractionated radio-therapy alone to an increased total dose of 77.6 Gy

These complex situations give rise to problems and inaccuracies in both dosimetry and analytical/empirical dose calculation, and therefore require other than conventional methods. A natural diamond detector and a Markus parallel plate ionization chamber have been selected for clinical dosimetry in 6 MV photon beams. Results of simulations using the Monte Carlo system BEAM/EGS4 to model the beam geometry have been compared with dose measurements. A modification of the existing component module for multileaf collimators (MLCs) allowed the modeling of a linear accelerator SL 25 (Elekta Oncology Systems) equipped with a MLC with curved leaf-ends. A mechanical measurement method with spacer plates and a light-field edge detection technique are described as methods to obtain geometrical data of collimator openings for application in the Monte Carlo system. Generally a good agreement is found between measurements and calculations of depth dose distributions and deviations are typically less than 1%. Calculated lateral dose profiles slightly exceed measured dose distributions near the higher level of the penumbras for a 10x2 cm2 field, but agree well with the measurements for all other cases. The simulations are also able to predict variations of output factors and ratios of output factors as a function of field width and field-offset. The Monte Carlo results demonstrate that qualitative changes in energy spectra are too small to explain these variations and that especially geometrical factors affect the output factors and depth dose curves and profiles

The higher uptake by lymphomas of 67Gallium (67Ga) compared with monoclonal antibodies makes selective radiotherapy by the widely available 67Ga appealing. However, the gamma radiation of 67Ga used in scintigraphy is considered to be almost non-toxic to lymphoma cells. However, in addition to photon radiation 67Ga emits low energy Auger electrons and 80-90 keV conversion electrons which could be cytotoxic. The objective of the present study was the assessment of radiotoxicity of 67Ga on a lymphoid cell line: U937. Proliferation (MTT-assay) and clonogenic capacity (CFU-assay) were measured after 3 and 6 days incubation with 10, 20 and 40 microCi ml-1 67Ga. Growth inhibition was 36% after 3 days incubation and 63% after 6 days incubation with 40 microCi 67Ga ml-1. Clonogenic capacity was reduced by 51% after 3 days and 72% after 6 days incubation with 40 microCi ml-1 67Ga. A survival curve showed an initial shoulder and became steeper beyond 200-250 pCi cell-1 (low linear energy transfer type). Iso-effect doses of 67Ga and 90Yttrium (90Y) were determined. The iso-effect dose of 40 microCi 67Ga ml-1 (cumulative dose of conversion electrons 306 cGy) was 2.5 microCi 90Y ml-1 (cumulative dose 494 cGy) and the iso-effect dose of 80 microCi 67Ga ml-1 was 5.0 microCi 90Y/ml. The main cytotoxic effect of 67Ga seems to be induced by the 80 keV conversion electrons. We conclude that the conversion electrons of 67Ga have a cytotoxic effect on U937 cells and that in our experiments a 16-fold higher microCi-dose of 67Ga than of 90Y was needed for the same cytotoxic effect. We believe that 67Ga holds promise for therapeutic use

At the present time, we believe it is interesting to present the methodologies of the SALT (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon) group. Up to the present time we have irradiated 693 patients using a single fraction. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represented the majority (90%) of treated lesions. Irradiation protocol has little changed since 1986, and the localization of the target volume was performed in the neurosurgery department of St Anne Hospital, France. The stereotactic images (computerized tomography [CT], angiography) were sent to the radiotherapy department of Tenon Hospital through the French public digital network NUMERIS. Protocol was realized using the stereotactic ARTEMIS-3D/Dosigray TPS. The lesion volume was filled by one or more spherical or elliptical subvolumes using the "Associated Target Methodology". The interactive adjustment of subvolumes was based on the 3D graphical representations of the lesion. The direct optimization of the irradiation space was performed by managing parameters provided by the DDB (Dosimetric Data Base) such as the number of arcs, their angular position, as well as the starting and the ending point of each arc. The evaluation of the calculated dose distribution was made using quantitative parameters. The second method of optimization was based on the minibeam intensity modulation using a mathematical theory of inverse problems and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. At the present time, due to technical reasons, linear accelerators do not permit the modulation of intensity of arctherapy. Thus we transformed the profiles of irregular forms into rectangular profiles of modulated ponderation, with each optimized plan being evaluated before its implementation. The criteria of evaluation were derived from the differential and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH). The DVHs permitted the evaluation of the volumes of underdosage and overdosage inside the lesion and in the healthy tissue, respectively. Using DVHs, we have defined parameters such as the conform factor and the homogeneity index. We stress that the methodology of protocol optimization is valid for single or multiple fractions as well as for intra- and extra-cranial irradiation

Carbon ions were generated by a medically dedicated accelerator (HIMAC, Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan), which was the world's first heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. In general, patients were selected for treatment when their tumors could not be expected to respond favorably to conventional forms of therapy. A total of 1601 patients were registered in this clinical trial so far. The normal tissue reactions were acceptable, and there were no carbon related deaths. Carbon ion radiotherapy seemed to be a clinically feasible curative treatment modality, and appears to offer improved results not only over conventional X-rays but also even over surgery in some selected carcinomas.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children

PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: In 41 patients irradiated for unilateral breast cancer the regular scoring by CTC was done during radiotherapy. In parallel, a total of 4,920 spectrophotometric measurements to determine the skin color were performed at baseline, at the beginning of radiotherapy, and at 20, 40 and 60 Gy. The nonirradiated contralateral breast was used for control measurements. RESULTS: As expected, the skin color (especially red) depended on the radiation dose applied to the skin. The objective spectrophotometric measurements were found to correlate well with the subjective CTC scores. CONCLUSION: For classification of acute radiation toxicity there seems to be no need to replace the common CTC scoring by technical methods

There is a lack of effective treatments for individuals with advanced disease. Many melanomas exhibit high levels of radioresistance. The direct consequence of gamma-irradiation for most melanoma cells is growth arrest at the G2-M phase of cell cycle. However, radiation-induced signaling pathways may affect numerous additional targets in cancer cells. We show in the present study that gamma-irradiation, as well as alpha-particle exposure, dramatically increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface TRAIL-receptor 1/receptor 2 (DR4/DR5) levels and to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface Fas levels. Additionally, increased dynamin-2 expression after irradiation is critically important in the translocation of death receptor to the cell surface. Moreover, sodium arsenite treatment may up-regulate expression of endogenous TRAIL and induces its translocation to cell surface and further down-regulates cFLIP levels in melanoma cells. We have evaluated the effects of sequential gamma-irradiation and arsenite treatment of melanoma cells for the induction of death signaling. Such treatment results in an efficient TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via a paracrine mechanism. These data highlight the efficacy of combined modality treatment involving radiation and arsenite in clinical management of this often fatal form of skin cancer

Although the importance of the area of irradiated lung is well known, the irradiated area of mediastinum is little to be considered in the routine treatment. PURPOSE: To evaluate the significance of the irradiated area of the mediastinum in the simulation film for radiation induced lung injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients with primary lung cancer treated with radiation therapy were analyzed for incidence of radiation induced lung injury. Lung injury was defined as the appearance of an abnormal shadow on the chest radiograph. CT images were used to differentiate recurrence or other conditions. Age, sex, irradiation dose, irradiated lung area, T and N factors of the tumor, irradiated mediastinum area, performance status of patients, location of irradiated fields and use of chemotherapy were analyzed with Cox's multivariate regression model. RESULTS: The cumulative rate of radiation induced lung injury at 12 months was 85%. Significant factor of radiation induced lung injury was irradiated area of the mediastinum (p = 0.03). Irradiated area of the lung (p = 0.18, n.s.), total tumor dose (p = 0.1, n.s.), use of chemotherapy (p = 0.08, n.s.) and location of irradiated field (p = 0.08, n.s.) may also have an effect on radiation induced lung injury.

We evaluated whether L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake and its change after CIRT were the early survival predictors in patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MET positron emission tomography was prospectively performed in 62 patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas before and within 1 month after CIRT. Tumor MET uptake was measured with the semiquantitative tumor:nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). The MET uptake in the tumor and relevant clinical parameters were entered into univariate and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 20 months. Patients with a baseline T/N ratio of <or=6 had a significant better survival than patients with a baseline T/N ratio >6 (2-year survival rate: 69.4% versus 32.3%; P = 0.01). Patients with a post-CIRT ratio of <or=4.4 had a better survival than that with a post-CIRT ratio >4.4 (2-year survival rate: 63.7% versus 41.3%; P = 0.01). A significant higher survival rate was observed in patients with post-therapeutic MET uptake change of >30% than patients in lower change group (2-year survival rate: 74.6% versus 41.6%; P = 0.049). The multivariate analysis showed that both baseline and post-CIRT T/N ratio were statistically significant independent predictors of patient survival. Tumors with larger T/N ratio had a significantly poorer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: MET uptake as measured by either baseline or post-CIRT T/N ratio was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherapy, whereas post-therapeutic MET uptake change might have potential value for the same purpose

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84% and 77%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS

In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

A planning intercomparison	Berlin, Eye Injuries/et [Etiology], Eye Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Fovea Centralis, Germany, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Methods, Optic Disk, Optic Nerve, Patients, Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Safety, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton and stereotactic radiotherapy with photons (SRT) are both used to treat choroidal melanomas in proximity to optic disk and fovea centralis, a situation where plaque therapy is prone to complications. A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated

Protocols were largely nonrandomized. Some results have been obtained: 1) results with mixed beam studies for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix have been equivocal compared with the photon controls. 2) some trends of local control have been observed in the trial of esophageal cancer, early cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung and malignant melanoma. 3) significant better results were observed in the pancoast type lung cancer and osteo sarcoma which was treated by the systemic multimodal treatment. It is concluded that neutrons are efficacious for certain specific tumor types owing to some biological effects, however the problem of inferior dose distribution was the weakness of neutron therapy at present.

0	3425	Chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by neutron irradiation	Cell Survival, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Effects, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage	In vitro dose--response curves of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes have been obtained for neutron spectra of mean energies 0-7, 0-9, 7-6 and 14-7 MeV. The aberration yields have been fitted to the quadratic function Y = alphaD + betaD2, which is consistent with the single-track and two-track model of aberration formation. However with high-LET radiation, the linear component of yield, corresponding to damage caused by single tracks, predominants, and this term becomes more dominant with increasing LET, so that for fission spectrum neutrons the relationship is linear, Y = alphaD. At low doses, such as those recieved by radiation workers, limiting r.b.e. values between 13 and 47 are obtained relative to 60Co gamma-radiation. At higher doses, as used in radiotherapy, the values are much lower; ranging from 2-7 to 8 at 200 rad of equivalent gamma-radiation. Both sets of r.b.e. values correlate well with track-averaged LET but not with dose-averaged LET. When the numbers of cells without aberrations are plotted against radiation dose, curves are obtained which are similar in shape to those for conventional cell-survival experiments with comparable neutron spectra. The Do values obtained in the present study are close to those from other cell system

METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery

The distribution was determined for four nuclides: 232Th and its decay products, 228Ra and 228Th; and 230Th, a contaminant associated with Thorotrast. More than 90% of the activity was associated with the reticuloendothelial system. Approximately 32% of the total activity was found in the total skeleton (mineral bone and bone marrow), which is somewhat higher than expected from the literature. The 44% found in the liver and 12% in the spleen were somewhat lower than expected. This difference may be attributable, in part, to the initial deposition as influenced by colloidal particle size and to the radiation-induced hyposplenism, splenic atrophy, and slight hepatic atrophy observed at autopsy. In addition, roughly 3% of the activity was found in the Thorotrastoma and surrounding carotid artery tissue. Estimated lifetime absorbed doses from the 232Th series were 15 Gy to the liver, 121 Gy to the spleen, 4 Gy to the skeleton, and 16 Gy to the Thorotrastoma. Comparable dose equivalents to these tissues are 300, 2420, 80, and 320 Sv, respectively, assuming a quality factor of 20 for alpha irradiation

In this study the effectiveness of "high dose intravenous immunoglobulin" (IVIG) in Graves' ophthalmopathy treatment is explored. 11 patients were treated with orbital radiotherapy combined with systemic corticosteroid (Group 1), while 10 patients were treated with the combination of orbital irradiation and IVIG (Group 2). The therapeutic effect was assessed by an ophthalmopathy index based on the American Thyroid Association, classification of ocular changes of Graves' ophthalmopathy. All signs and symptoms of endocrine ophthalmopathy improved significantly in both groups. The mean ophthalmopathy index decreased from 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 3.4 +/- 1.5 in Group 1, and from 7.0 +/- 1.8 to 3.0 +/- 2.1 in Group 2. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between Group 1 and 2 mean initial and final ophthalmopathy index, and a significant difference between initial and final ophthalmopathy index both in Group 1 and 2. While side effects were present in Group 1 treated with systemic corticosteroid, no side effect was observed in patients treated with IVIG. These preliminary results suggest that IVIG is safe and effective in the treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy

Clinical presentation is related to local invasion. Lesion of the body of the clivus can extend ventrally or dorsally and cause cranial nerve palsies, brain stem compression or hydrocephalus. Pathologically, they form soft, grey masses that are histologically benign but locally invasive and destructive. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging clearly depict the lesion. CT better demonstrates bone destruction and intralesional calcifications. In our case, MR was performed first and showed all the classical signs of skull base chordoma. CT provided complementary information about bone destruction which are also usual in this type of lesion.

Clinical presentation is related to local invasion. Lesion of the body of the clivus can extend ventrally or dorsally and cause cranial nerve palsies, brain stem compression or hydrocephalus. Pathologically, they form soft, grey masses that are histologically benign but locally invasive and destructive. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging clearly depict the lesion. CT better demonstrates bone destruction and intralesional calcifications. In our case, MR was performed first and showed all the classical signs of skull base chordoma. CT provided complementary information about bone destruction which are also usual in this type of lesion.

1	1296	Study on dosimetric parameters for stereotactic radiosurgery and intensity-modulated radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Meningeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/ra [Radiography], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Neuroma,Acoustic/ra [Radiography], Neuroma,Acoustic/rt [Radiotherapy], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	This study is an attempt to compare the dosimetric parameters of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using patient data. Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity

Over 100 patients were treated using this system, which is fitted to a Clinac 600C linac. Both cranial and extracranial lesions have been treated using this modality. Immobilization is achieved either with the Talon system for cranial sites or an Aquaplast cast. Target volumes up to 500 cm3 have been treated. Multiple lesions (up to 3) were treated in one setup. The range of dose/fractionation schemes used was 15 Gy/1 fx (radiosurgical treatment) - 80 Gy/40 fx. Dose validation studies were carried out using film and ion chamber dosimetry in a specially designed phantom. Optimal dose distributions were attainable using inverse treatment planning for IMRT delivery. These were found to encompass the target volumes accurately using dose validation phantom studies. Immobilization methods used were accurate to within 1 mm, as evidenced by daily portal films. IMRT using the Peacock system offers the advantage of delivery of conformal therapy to high doses safely and accurately. This provides the opportunity for dose escalation studies, retreatment of previously treated tumors, as well as treating multiple targets in one setup. The system may be fitted to a conventional linac without major modifications

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision

The superior local tumor control and overall survival achieved with fractionated proton RT can be attributed to improved dose localization characteristics of protons, resulting in higher doses delivered. Patients with base of skull neoplasms are increasingly considered for stereotactic radiosurgery. Recently, Muthukumar et al reported for the University of Pittsburgh group on cobalt-60 Gamma Knife (Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA) therapy for 15 patients with chordomas or chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. With tumor volumes ranging between 0.98 and 10.3 mL (mean, 4.6 mL), doses to the tumor margin varying from 12 to 20 Gy (median, 18 Gy) were delivered. Two patients were treated without histologic tumor confirmation. After a median follow-up time of 40 months, 2 patients had died of disease, 2 patients had succumbed to intercurrent disease, and 1 patient surviving at the time of analysis had developed tumor progression. Neither actuarial local control nor actuarial survival data were presented. In the LLUMC series, most tumors exceeded sizes reportedly suitable for radiosurgery or were of a highly irregular configuration. Nevertheless, in 11 patients, tumors less than 15 mL in size remained locally controlled as did tumors sized between 15 and 25 mL in 11 additional patients; these patients were thus potential candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery. At present, too few reports on radiosurgery contain sufficient patient numbers and statistical analyses to permit one to draw conclusions about the feasibility of radiosurgery for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull. A principal difference between proton RT and radiosurgery as currently practiced in most centers concerns target definition. In proton RT, the GTV is treated. In addition, a clinical volume is defined, which is distinctly different from the GTV in size and shape, to include the operative site and other areas of microscopic risk. In many instances, only the GTV is targeted in radiosurgery. Although it is certainly appropriate to explore the role that radiosurgical techniques may have in treating these tumors, results should be evaluated against the excellent outcome that can be achieved with fractionated proton RT, particularly in patients with tumors small enough and of favorable configuration and location to make them candidates for radiosurgery. The present problem of particle therapy is its limited availability. In the United States, only two proton centers can currently provide treatment for base of skull lesions. The HCL is soon to be replaced by a hospital-based facility at the MGH. Several other proton centers in the United States are currently under active consideration. Proton RT is an evolutionary process. Recent developments in proton RT include intensity modulated therapy and improvements in beam delivery systems, namely, the introduction of active beam scanning. These should further increase the degree of dose conformity. In addition, other heavy particles are also being investigated so as to combine the physical advantages of protons with the differential increased biologic effectiveness of particles in tumor as compared to normal tissues. A report from the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Darmstadt, Germany, has not revealed any increased acute toxicities in the first 13 patients with skull base chordomas or chondrosarcomas treated using carbon ions. Several important factors have emerged from recently published results: Patients with low-grade chondrosarcomas and male patients with chordomas have an excellent chance of durable tumor control and long-term survival after proton RT. Severe complications are within the acceptable range considering the high doses delivered and given the major morbidity associated with uncontrollable tumor growth in such patients. Female patients with chordomas experience increased early and late failures [References: 35]

The in-vivo MR spectra of malignant breast tissue of patients (n = 67) suffering from infiltrating ductal carcinoma are dominated by the water resonance, while the spectra of the unaffected contralateral breast tissue of these patients are mainly dominated by resonance arising from lipids which is similar to the spectra of normal breast tissue obtained from volunteers (controls, n = 16). In addition to the water and lipid peaks, in majority of the patients (approximately 80%) the water suppressed spectra showed a resonance at 3.2 ppm due to choline containing compounds (TCho) before treatment. In patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, absence/reduction in choline was observed in 89% of the patients. TCho was also observed in 2 of 14 benign lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of in-vivo MRS in detecting TCho in malignant tumours was 78% and 86%, respectively. Observation of TCho before treatment and its disappearance (or reduction) after treatment may be a useful indicator of response of locally advanced breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

In this study, quality assurance for FSRT of 58 cases, between August 1995 and August 1997 are described, and the errors for each step and overall accuracy were estimated. Some of the important items for FSRT procedures are: accuracy in CT localization, transferred image distortion, laser alignment, isocentric accuracy of linear accelerator, head frame movement, portal verification, and various human errors. A geometric phantom, that has known coordinates was used to estimate the accuracy of CT localization. A treatment planning computer was used for checking the transferred image distortion. The mechanical isocenter standard (MIS), rectilinear phantom pointer: (RLPP), and laser target localizer frame (LTLF) were used for laser alignment and target coordinates setting. Head-frame stability check was performed by a depth confirmation helmet (DCH). A film test was done to check isocentric accuracy and portal verification. All measured data for the 58 patients were recorded and analyzed for each item. 4-MV x-rays from a linear accelerator, were used for FSRT, along with homemade circular cones with diameters from 20 to 70 mm (interval: 5 mm). The accuracy in CT localization was 1.2+/-0.5 mm. The isocentric accuracy of the linear accelerator, including laser alignment, was 0.5+/-0.2 mm.

In this study, quality assurance for FSRT of 58 cases, between August 1995 and August 1997 are described, and the errors for each step and overall accuracy were estimated. Some of the important items for FSRT procedures are: accuracy in CT localization, transferred image distortion, laser alignment, isocentric accuracy of linear accelerator, head frame movement, portal verification, and various human errors. A geometric phantom, that has known coordinates was used to estimate the accuracy of CT localization. A treatment planning computer was used for checking the transferred image distortion. The mechanical isocenter standard (MIS), rectilinear phantom pointer: (RLPP), and laser target localizer frame (LTLF) were used for laser alignment and target coordinates setting. Head-frame stability check was performed by a depth confirmation helmet (DCH). A film test was done to check isocentric accuracy and portal verification. All measured data for the 58 patients were recorded and analyzed for each item. 4-MV x-rays from a linear accelerator, were used for FSRT, along with homemade circular cones with diameters from 20 to 70 mm (interval: 5 mm).

These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Monte Carlo calculations were performed to evaluate the pencil-beam algorithm in patient geometries for a modulated 150-MeV proton beam. A modified version of a Monte Carlo code described in a previous publication (18) was used for these comparisons. Tissue densities were inferred from patient CT data on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and calculations were performed with and without tissue compensators. A dose calculation module using the new algorithm was written, and treatment plans using the new algorithm were compared to plans using standard ray-tracing techniques for 10 patients with clival chordoma and three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with helium lons at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL). RESULTS: Pencil beam calculations agreed well with Monte Carlo calculations in the patient geometries. The pencil-beam algorithm predicted several multiple-scattering effects that are not modeled by conventional ray-tracing calculations. These include (a) the widening of the penumbra as a function of beam penetration, (b) the degradation in the sharpness of the dose gradient at the end of the particle range in highly heterogeneous regions, and (c) the appearance of hot and cold dose regions in the shadow of complex heterogeneities. In particular, pencil-beam calculations indicated that the dose distribution within the target was not as homogeneous as expected on the basis of ray-tracing calculations. On average, for the 13 patients considered, only about 72% of the conedown target volume received at least 99% of the prescribed dose, whereas, 93% of the conedown volume was contained within the 95% isodose surface. This may be significant because in standard charged particle dose calculations, the dose across the spread-Bragg peak is assumed to be uniform and equal to the maximum or prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Dose distributions computed with the pencil-beam model are more accurate than ray-tracing calculations, providing additional information to clinicians, which may influence the doses they prescribe. In particular, these calculations indicate that for some patients with skull-base tumors, it may be advantageous to prescribe proton doses to a lower isodose level than is commonly done

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients

The constant support of an up-to-date and specialized laboratory and nursing staff may reduce the most common compliances of the neoplastic disease course and therapy. Neoplastic child with his family is facing a terrible stress, often with incumbent death risks. So a psychologic help is advisable for the whole family, and the best feeling is requested for the physicians. Supportive therapy must provide prevention and correction of the most common compliances of tumoral conditions, i.e. infections and hemorrhages . A correct and specific antibiotic therapy is absolutely necessary, but sometime is not sufficient.

1	439	Curative treatment of Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer with carbon ion beams using a hypofractionated regimen	Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Quality of Life, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Research, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: A phase I/II study on carbon ion radiotherapy for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was first conducted between 1994 and 1999 and determined the optimal dose. Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66%) of these were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the data were statistically processed by using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 5 years or until death with a median follow-up time of 59.2 months (range, 6.0-83.0 months). The local control rate for all patients was 94.7%. The patients' 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 75.7% (IA: 89.4; IB: 55.1), and overall survival 50.0% (IA: 55.2; IB: 42.9). No toxic reactions in the lung greater than Grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy, a new treatment modality with superior benefits in terms of quality of life and activity of daily living, has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for Stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

The system consisted of a conventional linear accelerator, invasive fixation head frame (RADFRAME, Mizuho Ika Kogyo), and a tungsten collimator. The RADFRAME was developed to be used with any linear accelerators and with any dose planning systems. The accuracy of the irradiation was assured to be within +/-1.5mm. Fifty-one patients with metastatic brain tumors were treated using the system. The overall median survival time was 10 months. No difference in survival was observed between patients with a single lesion and patients with two or three lesions. Complete, partial, and minimal responses were obtained in 16 (39%), 18 (41%), and 7 (16%) lesions. These were comparable to the reported results of gamma knife treatment. A maximum dose of 25 Gy was suggested to be more effective than lower doses. Local control rate was higher in tumors with a diameter of less than 2.0cm (87.5%) than in larger tumors (60%). No difference in tumor response was observed among various histopathologic types. In a patient with a 25mm cerebellar metastasis from an adenocarcinoma of the lung, autopsy at 5 months after STI showed fibrinoid degeneration and hyaline deposition without residual tumor at the Gd-enhanced region on MRI. The efficacy of linac stereotactic irradiation was equal to that of gamma knife radiotherapy for metastatic brain tumors

The authors also report their preliminary experience in the treatment of 6 consecutive pediatric patients with intracerebral vascular malformations using gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery. METHODS: The various stereotactic radiosurgery methods currently used (charged-particle beam, modified linear accelerator, and GK) are described. At the Department of Neurosurgery in Verona, from February 1993 to February 1996, stereotactic GK radiosurgery was performed on 721 patients, including 20 of pediatric age (3%). Of the 78 AVMs, 7 (9%) were diagnosed in children. One patient was lost at follow-up. Among the remaining 6 children, there were 3 males and 3 females with a mean age of 12.3 years (range, 5-16 years). Treatment general anesthesia was needed only in 1 case. The AVM volume was always less than 10 cc. After completion of the procedure, children were discharged from the hospital the following day. RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 29 months (median 18.8 months). The angiographic confirmed total obliteration is used as the end point of an AVM treated radiosurgically, and usually requires 2 to 3 years. All the patients are alive; four of the treated children are neurologically normal and one patient has clinically improved to a normal neurological status. The sixth patient has fixed neurological deficits that existed prior to treatment. Among the three cases with a follow-up period of over 2 years, complete obliteration has been angiographically confirmed in 2 patients and subtotal in 1 patient. In the three remaining patients with follow-up periods less than 2 years, serial MR images suggest subtotal obliteration in 2 cases and no significant change in one patient who had undergone treatment within the current year. To date, neither persistent GK radiosurgery-related complications nor bleeding following stereotactic radiosurgery has been described. CONCLUSIONS: The review of literature and our preliminary results suggest that also in children, as in adults, the use of stereotactically delivered irradiation represents a safe and effective technique obtaining complete obliteration of AVMs previously considered surgically inaccessible due to their location and poor response to resection and/or embolization

Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

Between 1983 and 1988, 127 patients were treated. Results are analysed on a group of 84 patients followed 18 months and more. In 72 cases a reduction of thickness was noted. It was complete in 33 cases. Enucleation was performed in 10 patients due to no response or regrowth. In 3 cases the tumor was sterilized. Five patients died of metastases, and 73 are alive, 3 of them with liver metastases. An afterloading iridium template disk was used in 8 patients. 4 of them with a tumor thickness between 6.5 and 8 mm had a good response. Edema of the fovea was observed in 21% of cases, while cataracts were very unusual with Ru 106. An enucleation was performed in 6 patients because of a complication. A useful vision may be preserved in 60% of cases. The scleral tolerance dose is close to 1,500 Gy. These results are in agreement with those of the literature and are considered to be satisfactory for tumors not exceeding 5 to 6 mm in thickness. If the tumor is located close to the fovea or the papilla, and/or if the thickness is 8 mm or more, proton beam could be a good alternative

[French]	Adult, Aged, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Iridium Radioisotopes, Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Liver, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Radioisotopes, Ruthenium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Vision	Following the experience of the German authors, the treatment of choroidal melanoma with ruthenium 106 disk was introduced in Lyon. Between 1983 and 1988, 127 patients were treated. Results are analysed on a group of 84 patients followed 18 months and more. In 72 cases a reduction of thickness was noted. It was complete in 33 cases. Enucleation was performed in 10 patients due to no response or regrowth. In 3 cases the tumor was sterilized. Five patients died of metastases, and 73 are alive, 3 of them with liver metastases. An afterloading iridium template disk was used in 8 patients. 4 of them with a tumor thickness between 6.5 and 8 mm had a good response. Edema of the fovea was observed in 21% of cases, while cataracts were very unusual with Ru 106. An enucleation was performed in 6 patients because of a complication. A useful vision may be preserved in 60% of cases. The scleral tolerance dose is close to 1,500 Gy. These results are in agreement with those of the literature and are considered to be satisfactory for tumors not exceeding 5 to 6 mm in thickness. If the tumor is located close to the fovea or the papilla, and/or if the thickness is 8 mm or more, proton beam could be a good alternative

1	445	Evaluation of surface and superficial dose for head and neck treatments using conventional or intensity-modulated techniques	Antineoplastic Protocols, Calibration, Fluorides/ch [Chemistry], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lithium Compounds/ch [Chemistry], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/mt [Methods]	With increased use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck treatment questions have arisen as to selection of an optimum treatment approach when either superficial sparing or treatment is desired. Other work has pointed out the increased superficial dose resulting from obliquity effects when multiple tangential beams are applied to head and neck treatment, as is the general case in IMRT planning. Helical tomotherapy might be expected to result in even further enhanced superficial dose compared with conventional bilateral field treatment. We have designed a typical right oropharynx target volume in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Three different treatment techniques have been used to optimally treat this target, including bilateral static fields, eight-field IMRT and helical tomotherapy. The phantom was immobilized in a standard treatment position and treated on a Varian 2300cd linear accelerator and on a Hi-Art Helical Tomotherapy unit. 1 mm3 lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed on the surface of the phantom at a number of axial test positions. Film strips (Kodak EDR2) were either wrapped around the surface or sandwiched within the phantom. Measured doses at the surface and as a function of depth are compared with the planning system predictions for each treatment technique. The maximum surface doses on the proximal treatment side, averaged from TLDs and films, were measured to be 69-82% of the target dose with the bilateral fields yielding the lowest surface doses (69%), tomotherapy about 2% more than that (71%) and IMRT 13% more (82%). Anterior to the target volume, doses are always low for bilateral treatment. In this case the minimum anterior surface dose (chin area) was 6% of the prescription dose from that technique as compared with 26% and 35% from the IMRT and tomotherapy methods, respectively. The Eclipse and Tomotherapy planning systems both modelled deep and superficial doses well. Surface doses were better modelled by Eclipse at the test points, while the tomotherapy plans consistently overestimated the measured doses by 10% or more. Depth dose measurements, extracted from embedded films, indicated the depth of dose build-up to >99% to be the shallowest for IMRT (2-5 mm) followed by tomotherapy (5-8 mm) and bilateral fields (10-15 mm). The amount of surface dose is clearly technique dependent and should be taken into account in the planning stage

The advent of localized proton spectroscopy has made this detection possible. The spectral peak intensities were found to be very different depending on tumor tissue pathology. METHODS: The tumor cell reaction after radiation therapy was examined with proton localized spectroscopy in addition to enhanced MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips, Gyroscan S15-HP). Plain MR images (short spin echo) were used for localization pilot images, and after the MRS study, contrast enhanced MRI was carried out. Studies were performed pre-radiation, mid-radiation, and post-radiation if possible. MATERIALS: Sixteen patients (total 27 examinations) with intracranial tumors and three normal volunteers underwent proton NMR localized spectroscopy. The brain tumors were diagnosed before the MR study, and nine patients had metastatic brain tumors, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, and seven other patients were diagnosed with glioma-type tumors. RESULTS: The reaction patterns of proton NMR spectroscopy of brain tumors after radiation therapy were very different and depended on tumor histology. CONCLUSION: Proton NMR spectroscopy is an excellent means of determining tumor cell viability

0	704	Dynamic collimator optimization compared with fixed collimator angle in arc-based stereotactic radiotherapy: a dosimetric analysis	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods]	OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of static and dynamic collimator optimization when using a micromultileaf collimator (mMLC) in dynamic-arc stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) by evaluating the dose to healthy peritumoral tissue. METHODS: Thirty patients previously treated for intracranial lesions with the BrainLAB mMLC underwent retrospective replanning. Three collimator optimization strategies were compared for a simulated SRS treatment plan, as follows: Strategy 1, static collimation fixed at 90 degrees throughout arcs; Strategy 2, static collimator settings optimized for each arc; and Strategy 3, dynamic collimator settings optimized every 10 degrees throughout treatment arcs. Dose-volume histograms for a 0.7-cm shell of healthy peritumoral tissue were quantitatively compared. Collimator optimization schemes (Strategies 2 and 3) significantly decreased the volume of peritumoral tissue that is irradiated when compared with static collimation at 90 degrees (Strategy 1). The volume was reduced by 40.6% for Strategy 2 (95% confidence interval [CI] +/- 11) and by 47.1% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 8.1) at the 95% isodose; by 28.4% for Strategy 2 (95% CI +/- 4.9) and 39.1% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 6) at the 90% isodose; and by 18.2% for Strategy 2 (95% CI +/- 8.1) and 25.4% for Strategy 3 (95% CI +/- 7.1) at the 80% isodose. Serial collimator optimization throughout the treatment arcs (Strategy 3) reduced the mean volume of peritumoral tissue irradiated when compared with static collimator optimization (Strategy 2), by 16.1% (95% CI +/- 1.5) at 95% isodose, by 11.7% (95% CI +/- 1) at 90% isodose, and by 8.2% (95% CI +/- 1.2) at 80% isodose regions. In specific cases, linear or polynomial functions were formulated to optimize collimator settings dynamically throughout treatment arcs. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic collimator optimization during arc-based SRS decreases the volume of healthy peritumoral tissue treated with high doses of radiation and appears to be an effective method of improving target conformality. This study is the first step toward determination of a smoothing function algorithm to allow for true dynamic collimation during SRS

Dose measurements in dynamically generated dose distributions with a single ionization chamber require a complete application of the treatment field for each single measurement. Therefore measurements are performed by simultaneous use of multiple ionization chambers. The measurement is performed by a computer controlled system and is comprised of the following steps: (a) automated positioning of the ionization chambers, (b) measurement at these points, (c) a comparison with the calculated dose from the treatment planning system, and (d) documentation of the measurement. The ionization chambers are read out by a multichannel electrometer and are densely packed into a mounting of polymethylmetacrylate, which is attached to the arm of a three-dimensional motor-driven water phantom. The measured and planned dose values are displayed numerically as well as graphically. The mean deviation between measured and planned doses as well as their standard deviation are calculated and displayed. Through printouts complete documentation of the measurement is obtained and a quick decision can be made whether the dose distribution is acceptable for the patient. The system is now routinely used for dose verification at the heavy ion therapy project at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. Up to now 242 measurements have been performed for heavy ion treatment of 30 patients. The system allows efficient verification and documentation of carbon ion fields and is in principle also applicable to intensity-modulated photon beams

Analysis of early and late side effects and complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, early and late complications were assessed in 50 patients as a function of hypoxyradiotherapeutic dose increase. The preliminary treatment results of this radiotherapeutic modification were evaluated after a median follow-up of 48 months using Kaplen-Meier analysis. Between April 1991 and February 1997, 50 patients (36 men and 14 women) with colorectal carcinoma were treated preoperatively with locoregional accelerated hypofractionated hypoxyradiotherapy. The extent of disease was classified according to Dukes' criteria (A: four patients, B. 28 patients, C: 18 patients). We used a 20-MeV linear accelerator with two parallel opposed fields. Hypoxyradiotherapy was performed extending from the perineum to the L4 region. Acute hypoxia was induced during irradiation by ventilation of a hypoxic gas mixture containing 7.8-8.0% oxygen. Total doses of 24 Gy/8 days, 28 Gy/9 days, and 32 Gy/10 days were applied in five, 20, and 25 patients, respectively. Low anterior resection or abdominoperineal amputation of the rectum was performed the day after completion of preoperative hypoxyradiotherapy. The early reactions after irradiation were evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute (CTC-NCI). RESULTS: Early postirradiation proctitis was documented in three and early radiation-induced cystitis in two patients only. Neither early nor late radiation-associated complications were observed in any of the three hypoxyradiotherapy schedules during the follow-up period of 6-105 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (median 48 months), a 5-year overall survival rate of 61.5% and a local relapse-free survival rate of 84.2% can be expected. Treatment failures were predominantly systemic. CONCLUSION: We believe it can be concluded that acute hypoxia has a radioprotective effect on normal tissues during accelerated hypoxyradiotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. Hypoxyradiotherapy permits safe administration of doses higher than those tolerated by normoxic, noncanceorus tissue, resulting in the amplification of the biological effect of radiation on tumor tissue and contributing to an improved outcome after combined radiosurgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma

Hypoxyradiotherapy was performed extending from the perineum to the L4 region. Acute hypoxia was induced during irradiation by ventilation of a hypoxic gas mixture containing 7.8-8.0% oxygen. Total doses of 24 Gy/8 days, 28 Gy/9 days, and 32 Gy/10 days were applied in five, 20, and 25 patients, respectively. Low anterior resection or abdominoperineal amputation of the rectum was performed the day after completion of preoperative hypoxyradiotherapy. The early reactions after irradiation were evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute (CTC-NCI). RESULTS: Early postirradiation proctitis was documented in three and early radiation-induced cystitis in two patients only. Neither early nor late radiation-associated complications were observed in any of the three hypoxyradiotherapy schedules during the follow-up period of 6-105 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (median 48 months), a 5-year overall survival rate of 61.5% and a local relapse-free survival rate of 84.2% can be expected. Treatment failures were predominantly systemic. CONCLUSION: We believe it can be concluded that acute hypoxia has a radioprotective effect on normal tissues during accelerated hypoxyradiotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. Hypoxyradiotherapy permits safe administration of doses higher than those tolerated by normoxic, noncanceorus tissue, resulting in the amplification of the biological effect of radiation on tumor tissue and contributing to an improved outcome after combined radiosurgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma

Twenty-one of the 28 patients (75%) achieved at least a partial local response. There were 9 patients (32%) who achieved a complete response and 12 patients (43%) who achieved a partial response. The responses were 9/11 for squamous cell carcinoma, 5/10 for adenocarcinoma, 5/5 for large cell carcinoma, and 2/2 for small cell carcinoma patients. Treatment was very well tolerated and in fact, no acute radiation related complications were observed during the 10-12 week treatment duration. Radiation induced fibrosis of various degrees has occurred but it has been mostly asymptomatic and similar to what is normally seen using conventional continuous schedules. In this group of very advanced lung cancer patients, failures have mostly resulted from metastatic progression; only one patient progressed locally in the irradiated field without evidence of metastatic disease. A preliminary analysis indicates that this treatment yields results that are similar to those achieved with conventional fractionation regimens and should be explored further

This has important clinical implications, because when treated with similar aggressive treatment strategies, CSA has a much better prognosis than chordoma. In an effort to identify those morphologic and immunohistochemical features that help to identify conventional skull base CSA correctly and to understand its prognosis better, particularly compared with chordoma, when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, the authors performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 200 CSAs. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 79 years (mean, 39 years), 87 patients were male and 113 patients were female, and most presented with symptoms related to the central nervous system. Approximately 6% of the tumors arose in the sphenoethmoid complex, 28% originated in the clivus, and 66% developed in the temperooccipital junction. Histologically, 15 tumors (7.5%) were classified as hyaline CSA, 59 (29.5%) as myxoid CSA, and 126 (63%) as mixed hyaline and myxoid CSA. A total of 101 (50.5%) tumors were grade 1, 57 (28.5%) had areas of grades 1 and 2, and 42 (21%) were pure grade 2 neoplasms. The vast majority of patients originated from referring hospitals, and the diagnosis was changed prospectively at our institution to CSA from chordoma in 74 patients (37%). Of the tumors studied immunohistochemically, 96 of 97 (98.9%) stained for S-100 protein, 0 of 97 (0%) stained for keratin, and faint staining for epithelial membrane antigen was seen in 7 of 88 tumors (7.95%). All patients underwent high-dose postoperative fractionated precision conformal radiation therapy with a dose that ranged from 64.2 to 79.6 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents (median, 72.1 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents, given in 38 fractions. The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%. In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively. CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management

In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively. CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management	
1	2093	Chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull: a clinicopathologic study of 200 cases with emphasis on its distinction from chordoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Boston, Child, Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Radiation, Recurrence, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Rate	Conventional chondrosarcoma (CSA) of the skull base is an uncommon neoplasm that can resemble chordoma, and indeed it is misdiagnosed frequently as such. This has important clinical implications, because when treated with similar aggressive treatment strategies, CSA has a much better prognosis than chordoma. In an effort to identify those morphologic and immunohistochemical features that help to identify conventional skull base CSA correctly and to understand its prognosis better, particularly compared with chordoma, when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, the authors performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 200 CSAs. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 79 years (mean, 39 years), 87 patients were male and 113 patients were female, and most presented with symptoms related to the central nervous system. Approximately 6% of the tumors arose in the sphenoethmoid complex, 28% originated in the clivus, and 66% developed in the temperooccipital junction. Histologically, 15 tumors (7.5%) were classified as hyaline CSA, 59 (29.5%) as myxoid CSA, and 126 (63%) as mixed hyaline and myxoid CSA. A total of 101 (50.5%) tumors were grade 1, 57 (28.5%) had areas of grades 1 and 2, and 42 (21%) were pure grade 2 neoplasms. The vast majority of patients originated from referring hospitals, and the diagnosis was changed prospectively at our institution to CSA from chordoma in 74 patients (37%). Of the tumors studied immunohistochemically, 96 of 97 (98.9%) stained for S-100 protein, 0 of 97 (0%) stained for keratin, and faint staining for epithelial membrane antigen was seen in 7 of 88 tumors (7.95%). All patients underwent high-dose postoperative fractionated precision conformal radiation therapy with a dose that ranged from 64.2 to 79.6 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents (median, 72.1 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents, given in 38 fractions. The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%. In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively.

The cavity is defined to confine irradiation to the hand and modifies the neutron spectrum produced by a low energy accelerator neutron source to optimize activation per dose. Neutron and gamma-ray dose rates were measured with the microdosimetric technique using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter at the hand irradiation site and inside the hand access hole. For the outside of the cavity, a spherical neutron dose equivalent meter and a Farmer dosemeter were employed instead due to the low intensity of the radiation field. The maximum dose equivalent rate at the outside of the cavity was 2.94 microSv/100 microA min, which is lower by a factor of 1/2260 than the dose rate at the hand irradiation position. The local dose contributions from a hand, an arm and the rest of a body to the effective dose rate were estimated to be 1.73, 0.782 and 2.94 microSv/100 microA min, respectively. For the standard irradiation protocol of the in vivo hand activation, 300 microA min, an effective dose of 16.3 microSv would be delivered

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The motion of a patient due to respiration is detected by the motion of the body surface around the chest wall. A respiratory sensor was developed using an infrared light spot and a position-sensitive detector. A timing signal to request a beam is generated in response to the respiration waveform, and a carbon beam is extracted from the synchrotron using a RF-knockout method. CT images for treatment planning are taken in synchronization with the respiratory motion. For patient positioning, digitized fluoroscopic images superimposed with the respiration waveform were used. The relation between the respiratory sensor signal and the organ motion was examined using digitized video images from fluoroscopy. The performance of our gated system was demonstrated by using the moving phantom, and dose profiles were measured in the direction of phantom motion. RESULTS: The timing of gate-on is set at the end of the expiratory phase, because the motion of the diaphragm is slower and more reproducible than during the inspiratory phase. The signal of the respiratory sensor shows a phase difference of 120 milliseconds between lower and upper locations on the chest wall. The motion of diaphragm is delayed by 200 milliseconds from the respiration waveform at the lower location. The beam extraction system worked according to the beam on/off logic for gating, and the gated CT scanner performed well. The lateral penumbra size of the dose profile along the moving axis was distinguishably decreased by the gated irradiation. The ratio of the nongated to gated lateral fall-off was 4.3, 3.5, and 2. 0 under the stroke of 40.0, 29.0, and 13.0 mm respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed a total treatment system of gated irradiation for heavy-ion radiotherapy. We found that with this system the target margin along the body axis could be decreased to 5-10 mm although the target moved twice or three times. Over 150 patients with lung or liver cancer had already been treated by this gated irradiation system by the end of July 1999

For the purpose of confirming the feasibility of proton therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, we investigated the influence of proton therapy on liver function and also tried to evaluate the possibility of optimization using dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. The results indicated that proton therapy did not cause clinically symptomatic damage in liver function and the only notable change after proton therapy was the transient increase of transminase. DVH analysis showed that this transient increase of transaminase was well correlated to the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). These results indicate that localized high dose radiation using proton beams is feasible for the treatment of liver cancers and optimization of this treatment may be possible using DVH analysis

Thirty-four patients with histologically proven astrocytoma WHO II-IV after treatment by FSRT and a new suspect lesion in the follow-up were included in this study. Data were analysed by three independent radiologists with different experience in 1H SI: Data were verified by clinical follow-up (PT, progressive tumour; nPT, non-progressive tumour) and a kappa analysis was performed. Sensitivity and specificity of T1 weighted (w) and T2w MRI was compared (imaging at radiotherapy and follow-up) using further follow-up controls as gold standard and the additional benefit of 1H SI (imaging at follow-up) was calculated. Mean interval between last irradiation and detection of a suspicious lesion was 37 +/- 32 months. Time to clinical evaluation was 13 +/- 8 months. Interobserver agreement was significantly high in all analyses (kappa always >0.8, P < 0.05). T2w imaging proved to be superior to contrast enhanced T1w imaging in sensitivity (87.5 vs 81.25%) and specificity (85.7 vs 57.1%). Solitary 1H SI had similar results as T2w (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 71.4%). Taking all techniques into account, all PT were correctly diagnosed. Radiologists' experience had no significant influence on correct interpretation of a suspicious lesion. We conclude that 1H SI is helpful in characterising new suspicious lesions in irradiated gliomas, particularly if pre-MRI is not available for evaluating follow-up

RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate and median survival period from the beginning of the first course for the 27 patients were 55.6% and 62.2 months, respectively. Five-year local control rate for the 68 lesions was 87.8%. Of the patients, 1 with Child-Pugh class B and another with class C before the last course suffered from acute hepatic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated proton beam therapy for HCC is safe when the patient has a target in the peripheral region of the liver and liver function is Child-Pugh class A	
0	3898	The radiotherapeutical use of high energy electrons in West Germany	Electrons, Germany, Germany,West, Hospitals, Humans, Particle Accelerators/sd [Supply & Distribution], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/ut [Utilization]	Germany has always deserved a great interest to electron beam radiotherapy (betatron, linear accelerator). At St. Vincentius Hospital in Karlsruhe the percentage of electron treated patients grew up in the years from 15% to 45%. Electron energies between 7 and 12 MeV are the most commonly used. Major RT Centres need a wider range of energies (5/7-20 MeV), but the minor ones should have at least electron beams of 5-12/15 MeV

METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas and 8 had diffuse choroidal hemangiomas (DCH) and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Of the patients, 19 were treated with photons with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy. A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All patients with DCH but 1 were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of all patients. Tumor thickness decreased in 95.4% and retinal detachment resolved in 92.9%. Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected. In all, 40.9% showed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, maximum Grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity. Retinopathy and radiation-induced optic neuropathy were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely. No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected. Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects should be part of the follow-up procedures

METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1998, a total of 58 patients who could be evaluated were treated for skull base tumors, 33 for chordoma and 25 for chondrosarcoma. Following various surgical procedures, residual tumor was detected in 91% of patients; 59% demonstrated brainstem involvement. Target dosages ranged from 64.8 and 79.2 (mean 70.7) Co Gy equivalent. The range of follow up was 7 to 75 months (mean 33 months). In 10 patients (17%) the treatment failed locally, resulting in local control rates of 92% (23 of 25 patients) for chondrosarcomas and 76% (25 of 33 patients) for chordomas. Tumor volume and brainstem involvement influenced control rates. All tumors with volumes of 25 ml or less remained locally controlled, compared with 56% of tumors larger than 25 ml (p = 0.02); 94% of patients without brainstem involvement did not experience recurrence; in patients with brainstem involvement (and dose reduction because of brainstem tolerance constraints) the authors achieved a tumor control rate of 53% (p = 0.04). Three patients died of their disease, and one died of intercurrent disease. Actuarial 5-year survival rates were 100% for patients with chondrosarcoma and 79% for patients with chordoma. Grade 3 and 4 late toxicities were observed in four patients (7%) and were symptomatic in three (5%). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose proton RT offers excellent chances of lasting tumor control and survival, with acceptable risks. In this series all small- and medium-sized tumors with no demonstrable brainstem involvement have been controlled; all such patients are alive. Surgical debulking enhanced delivery of full tumoricidal doses, but even patients with large tumors and disease abutting crucial normal structures benefited

METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1998, a total of 58 patients who could be evaluated were treated for skull base tumors, 33 for chordoma and 25 for chondrosarcoma. Following various surgical procedures, residual tumor was detected in 91% of patients; 59% demonstrated brainstem involvement. Target dosages ranged from 64.8 and 79.2 (mean 70.7) Co Gy equivalent. The range of follow up was 7 to 75 months (mean 33 months). In 10 patients (17%) the treatment failed locally, resulting in local control rates of 92% (23 of 25 patients) for chondrosarcomas and 76% (25 of 33 patients) for chordomas. Tumor volume and brainstem involvement influenced control rates. All tumors with volumes of 25 ml or less remained locally controlled, compared with 56% of tumors larger than 25 ml (p = 0.02); 94% of patients without brainstem involvement did not experience recurrence; in patients with brainstem involvement (and dose reduction because of brainstem tolerance constraints) the authors achieved a tumor control rate of 53% (p = 0.04). Three patients died of their disease, and one died of intercurrent disease. Actuarial 5-year survival rates were 100% for patients with chondrosarcoma and 79% for patients with chordoma. Grade 3 and 4 late toxicities were observed in four patients (7%) and were symptomatic in three (5%). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose proton RT offers excellent chances of lasting tumor control and survival, with acceptable risks. In this series all small- and medium-sized tumors with no demonstrable brainstem involvement have been controlled; all such patients are alive.

METHODS: Thirty-six patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery, and with conventional magnetic resonance imaging examinations at regular time intervals until the initiation of a new treatment strategy. Patients were categorized on the basis of their initial spectroscopic results, and their performance was assessed in terms of change in contrast-enhancing volume, time to further treatment, and survival. RESULTS: The trends in the overall population were toward more extensive increase in the percent contrast-enhancing volume, a decreased time to further treatment, and a reduced survival time for patients with more extensive initial metabolic abnormalities. Statistical analysis of the subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme found a significant increase in relative contrast-enhancing volume (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), a decrease in time to further treatment (P < 0.01, log-rank test), and a reduction in survival time (P < 0.01, log-rank test) for patients with regions containing tumor-suggestive spectra outside the gamma knife target, compared with patients exhibiting spectral abnormalities restricted to the gamma knife target. Further studies are needed to establish statistical significance for patients with lower-grade lesions and to confirm the results observed in this study. CONCLUSION: The pretreatment spectroscopic results provided information that was predictive of outcome for this patient pool, both in local control (change in contrast-enhancing volume) and global outcome (time to further treatment and survival). This modality may have an important role in improving the selection, planning, and treatment process for glioma patients

In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a "damage ratio" (DR) and a "recovery ratio" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment

Iodine contrast agents (CA), used during computed tomography (CT) imaging, lead to an increase of the Hounsfield units in tissue with increased CA uptake and cause errors in the calculation of the ranges. The aim of this work is to quantify how accurately ion range is calculated in CA loaded tissue. In order to quantify the mean change in Hounsfield units (HU), a statistical analysis of 25 CT data sets with and without CA was performed. To establish a relation between the change in Hounsfield units due to CA and changes in ion range, the Hounsfield number for various CA concentrations and the range of ions in CA was measured. The analysis of CT data sets showed that after intravenous injection of 100 ml contrast agent (Imeron300) at a concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml an increase of the Hounsfield numbers in tumor tissue of up to 57 HU can be observed. The measured range shift in CA is much smaller than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The maximum error in range resulting from the CA enhanced data is approximately 2.5% and results mainly from this wrong interpretation of HU by the TPS. For a tumor with an extent of 5 cm this leads to an exaggeration of the ion ranges during irradiation of (1.24+/-0.04) mm. This may be clinically relevant in cases where highest precision is needed and where organs at risk are close to the target volume. In view of these findings it may be safer to rely solely on native CT data for the purpose of dose and range optimization in therapy planning for heavy ions and protons

Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors. However, simultaneous individual anesthetic challenges require pediatric anesthesiologists highly experienced with the pediatric airway, clinical alertness and closed monitoring

METHODS: We first define 3D-CRT in comparison to standard radiation therapy and discuss the assumptions on which the technology of 3D-CRT and dose escalation are based. We then examine the evidence on the benefits and limitations from the current most commonly cited studies on dose-escalation trials to treat prostate cancer. RESULTS: The assumption that 3D-CRT can provide a tighter margin around the tumor area to allow for dose escalation is not yet proven by studies that show continual difficulty in defining the planning treatment volume because of extrinsic and intrinsic difficulties, such as imaging variabilities and patient and organ movement. Current short-term dose-escalation studies on the use of 3D-CRT to treat prostate cancer are limited in their ability to prove that increasing dose improves survival and does not incur potential long-term complications to normal tissue. CONCLUSION: Although 3D-CRT is a promising technology that many radiation oncologists and clinics are quickly adopting to treat such tumors as prostate cancer, the long-term evidence on the benefits and limitations of this technology is still lacking. Until we have solid long-term evidence on the true clinical potential of this new technology, let us not rush to judgment, but exercise caution, diligence, and thoughtfulness in using this new technology to treat our patients.

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In primary breast cancer, it is estimated that about 300 of the annually 3 425 irradiated patients can potentially be candidates for proton beam therapy to reduce late toxicity, mainly from the heart and lungs.

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively.

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity

We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94%. One patient (2.2%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg

METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 32 patients underwent surgical resection for suspected progression of brain metastases from a cohort of 245 patients with brain metastases treated with GKR. Postradiosurgery MRI surveillance was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after GKR. In some cases, additional MRI scanning with spectroscopy or perfusion (MRS/P) was used to aid differentiation of radiation change from tumor progression. The decision to perform neurosurgical resection was based on MRI or clinical evidence of lesion progression among patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more and absent or stable systemic disease. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (32 out of 245) of patients and 6% (38 out of 611) of lesions required surgical resection after GKR. The median time from GKR to surgical resection was 8.6 months (range, 1.7-27.1 mo). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival from time of GKR was 97, 78, and 47% for the resected patients and 65, 40, and 19% for the nonresected patients (P < 0.0001). The two-year survival rate of patients requiring two resections after GKR was 100% compared with 39% for patients undergoing one resection (P = 0.02). The median survival of resected patients was 27.2 months (range, 7.0-72.5 mo) from the diagnosis of brain metastases, 19.9 months (range, 5.0-60.7 mo) from GKR, and 8.9 months (range, 0.2-53.1 mo) from surgical resection. Tumor was found in 90% of resected specimens and necrosis alone in 10%. MRS/P studies were performed in 15 resected patients. Overall, MRS/P predicted tumor in 11 lesions, confirmed pathologically in nine lesions, and necrosis alone was found in two. The MRS/P predicted necrosis alone in three, whereas pathology revealed viable tumor in two and necrosis in one lesion. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of progressive brain metastases after GKR in selected patients leads to a meaningful improvement in survival rates. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MRS/P in the postradiosurgery surveillance of brain metastases

Tandem and ovoids insertions were used and combinations of single and multiple applications along with high dose whole pelvic irradiation. Dosimetric analysis of treated cases for patterns of tissue dose were carried out. Tissue dose for Cf-NT was, in general, high for neutron components in the central pelvis only, and fell off rapidly with distance from the applicators. The majority and balance of therapeutic dose was contributed by low linear energy transfer (LET) high energy photon beam radiation to the whole pelvis. Comparison with fast neutron beam therapy (NBT) isodose curves showed that much more homogeneous neutron dose was delivered to the pelvic tumor and organs by NBT. Complication frequency has been reported to be higher for neutron beam therapy than for Cf-NT. It appears that the higher integral neutron biological dose to normal tissues for NBT compared to intracavitary Cf-NT probably contributed to the frequency of side effects

To achieve these dose distributions in patients requires use of modern imaging techniques, rigid immobilization systems, confirmation of target position vis a vis the proton beam at each treatment session, treatment planning which feature beam's eye view, displays of uncertainty, dose at each anatomic point, boli based on accurate assessment of density along each pixel, etc. Experience at MGH/MEEI/HCL has yielded a disease-free survival of 78% for patients with chordoma/chondrosarcoma of base of skull. Local control is achieved by 98% of patients treated for choroidal melanoma

Data on cancer incidence in Europe, Austria, and neighbouring countries are reviewed for the most frequent tumors suitable for charged particle therapy. From these data, the numbers of potential patients suitable for MED-AUSTRON are derived for each tumor site by applying the coefficients proposed in the EULIMA-1992 feasibility study. Whatever the assumptions made, a sufficient and adequate recruitment for MED-AUSTRON can be expected. However, an appropriate referring system has to be established within Austria and also in the neighbouring countries

We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma.

ROKUS apparatus and a linear accelerator of 15 MeV were used for irradiation at a single dose of 1.5 Gy and a total dose of 3-6 Gy, at a 2-4 day interval. STI efficacy was assessed by a response of the peripheral and intrathoracic lymph nodes, tumor foci in the lungs, by a decrease in liver and spleen sizes, a decrease in body temperature and the end of night sweating. Of 25 patients a positive effect was achieved in 19, in 4 patients it was absent, and in 2 patients disease progression was observed. A marked positive effect was noted in 8 previously untreated patients, especially with respect to the elimination of signs of intoxication. A conclusion has been made that STI can be employed for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease patients as a method of general cytostatic action. STI causes a more noticeable and prolonged leukopenia than a cycle of polychemotherapy

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival

With the aim of reducing late neuropsychologic morbidity a CT-scan-based dosimetric study was undertaken in which treatment was confined mainly or exclusively to supratentorial sites considered at high risk for disease recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comparative dosimetric study is presented in which a three field (two laterals and one posterior) proton plan (spot scanning method) is compared with a two-field conventional WBI 6 MV x-ray plan, to a 6-field "hand-made" 6 MV x-ray plan, and to a computer-optimized 9-field "inverse" 15 MV x-ray plan. For favorable patients, 30 Gy were delivered to the ventricles and main cisterns, the subfrontal and subtemporal regions, and the posterior fossa. For the unfavorable patients, 10 Gy WBI preceeded a boost to 30 Gy to the same treatment volume chosen for favorable patients. The dose distribution was evaluated with dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the targets as well as the dose to the nontarget brain and optical structures. In addition, the risks of radiation-related late neuropsychologic effects after WBI were collected from the literature and used to predict normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) for an intelligence quotient deficit after treatment with photon or proton beams. RESULTS: Proton beams succeeded better in reducing the dose to the brain hemispheres and eye than any of the photon plans. A 25.1% risk of an IQ score <90 was predicted after 30 Gy WBI. Almost a 10% drop in the predicted risk was observed when using proton beams in both favorable and unfavorable patients. However, predicted NTCPs for both optimized photon plans ("hand made" and "inverse") were only slightly higher (0.3-2.5%) than those of proton beams. An age-modifying factor was introduced in the predictive NTCP model to assess for IQ differences in relation with age at irradiation. Children with ages between age 4 to 8 benefitted most from the dose reduction in this exercise (similar NTCP predictions for both proton and "inverse" plans). CONCLUSION: Modulated proton beams may help to significantly reduce the irradiation of normal brain while optimally treating the supratentorial subsites at higher risk for relapse. A decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons and both optimized proton plans compared to WBI

Since that time, over 1000 patients have completed treatments and the facility currently treats more than 45 patients per day. With a typical intensity of 3 x 10(10) protons per pulse and 27 pulses per minute, dose rates of 90-100 cGy/min are easily achieved on a 20-cm diameter field. In most cases, patient treatment times are 2 min, much less than the patient alignment time required before each treatment. Nevertheless, there is considerable medical interest in increasing field sizes up to 40-cm diameter while keeping dose rates high and treatment times low. In this article, beam measurements relevant to intensity studies are presented and possible accelerator modifications for upgrades are proposed. It is shown that nearly all intensity losses can be ascribed to the large momentum spread of the injected beam and occur at or near the injection energy of 2 MeV. The agreement between calculations and measurements appears quite good. In addition, optimum beam characteristics for a new injector are discussed based upon the momentum acceptance and space charge limits of the Loma Linda synchrotron

We treated nine AVM, 12 metastatic brain tumors, two malignant lymphomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, two meningiomas, and one brain tumor of unknown pathology. In the follow-up examinations at least five months after treatment, the local control rate was 83% for the metastatic tumors, and two malignant lymphomas disappeared completely. In addition, satisfactory results have been obtained with AVM and other brain tumors without any side effects. In comparison with gamma-knife radiosurgery, linac radiosurgery has some disadvantages such as longer treatment time and cumbersome accuracy control, but if accuracy control is performed periodically, accuracies of 1 mm or less can be obtained. There is some strengths of linac radiosurgery as follow. 1) The acquisition cost is relatively low. 2) Dose distribution are equivalent to gamma-knife. 3) There is no field size limitation. 4) There is great flexibility in beam delivery and linac systems. Radiosurgery using linear accelerators seems to become widely accepted in the future

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with GBM were studied using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) and diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging after surgery but prior to XRT. Patients were categorized on the basis of their volumes of morphologic and metabolic abnormalities (volume of CNI > or = 2 and CNI values), normalized ADC (nADC), or rCBV values within the T1 contrast-enhancing and T2 regions. The median survival time was compared. RESULTS: A significantly shorter median survival time was observed for patients with a large volume of metabolic abnormality than for those with a small abnormality (12.0 and 17.1 months, respectively, P = 0.002). A similar pattern was observed for patients with a low mean nADC value compared to those with high mean nADC value within the T2 region (11.2 and 21.7 months, respectively, P = 0.004). A shorter median survival time was also observed for patients with contrast-enhancing residual disease than for those without the presence of contrast enhancement with marginal significance. CONCLUSION: The pre-XRT volume of the metabolic abnormality and the nADC value within the T2 region may be valuable in predicting outcome for patients with GBM. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc

0	2797	New surgical method to prevent pelvic radiation enteropathy	Absorption, Aged, Boston, Female, Humans, Massachusetts, Morbidity, Pelvis, Polyglycolic Acid/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protein-Losing Enteropathies/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Rectal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Surgical Mesh, Time, Universities	Pelvic radiation doses exceeding 4,000-4,500 cGy are known to be associated with acute and chronic radiation enteropathy. This same radiation dose is, at the same time, only moderately effective in the elimination of microscopic malignancy, let alone gross clinical disease. Numerous medical and surgical attempts to minimize this complication have been uniformly unsuccessful. With the availability of a new synthetic, absorbable, polyglycolic acid mesh, an intestinal sling surgical procedure has been devised to exclude the small bowel from the pelvis and subsequent radiation fields. Twenty-five patients have been treated by this new technique with only one complication presenting as a fungal infection. Small-bowel barium contrast studies in 16 patients referred for postoperative radiation demonstrated 13 satisfactory exclusions of the small bowel from the translateral pelvic irradiation field. In 16 evaluable patients, three had unsatisfactory exclusion two of which were due to technical error. This has permitted high-dose (5,500-6,500 cGy) radiotherapy to the critical treatment volume without posttreatment complication. Mean follow-up time is 14.8 months. Several patients have been reexplored demonstrating complete absorption of the mesh without fibrinous adhesions or other foreign body reaction. It is concluded that this new technique of small bowel exclusion will permit the routine delivery of much higher doses of radiation in patients requiring improved local-regional control of their pelvic cancers and without morbidity from radiation-associated small bowel injury

The tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density, and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing method

However, psychological distress and anxiety related to irradiation are often observed. Purpose of our study was the evaluation of the influence of radiotherapy-induced distress in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and June 1996 in 48 breast cancer patients (31 to 76 years old) treated by breast-conserving surgery adjuvant irradiation with or without systemic therapy was applied. On the first and the last day of radiotherapy they were given a questionnaire (Table 1) which was designed together with psychologists. Covering different situations related to radiotherapy the construction of items are determined by factors with possible influence on psychological distress and perception with regard to irradiation. RESULTS: Most of the women (92%) stated to be well informed about the irradiation and tried to obtain further information about this treatment (83%). 56% tried not to think about radiotherapy and/or to distract themselves (81%). 40% were anxious about the fact to undergo irradiation. In the end of treatment 77% reported to have been anxious only initially or never; only 19% were anxious almost or most of the time. 35% were worried about the expected cosmetic alterations of their breast; only 30% observed acute cosmetic changes. With regard to situation-related distress all patients (100%) stated that the communication with the medical staff made it easier to stand the irradiation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of theoretical considerations our results are explorative in character. However, following statements seem to be important: 1. A large requirement exists to get information about radiotherapy. 2. The patients experience irradiation treatment more positive than initially expected by themselves. 3. With regard to radiotherapy anxiety is reduced during the course of treatment. Here the psychosocial care of the medical staff is an important support for reduction of anxiety

In the end of treatment 77% reported to have been anxious only initially or never; only 19% were anxious almost or most of the time. 35% were worried about the expected cosmetic alterations of their breast; only 30% observed acute cosmetic changes. With regard to situation-related distress all patients (100%) stated that the communication with the medical staff made it easier to stand the irradiation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of theoretical considerations our results are explorative in character. However, following statements seem to be important: 1. A large requirement exists to get information about radiotherapy. 2. The patients experience irradiation treatment more positive than initially expected by themselves. 3. With regard to radiotherapy anxiety is reduced during the course of treatment. Here the psychosocial care of the medical staff is an important support for reduction of anxiety

However, psychological distress and anxiety related to irradiation are often observed. Purpose of our study was the evaluation of the influence of radiotherapy-induced distress in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and June 1996 in 48 breast cancer patients (31 to 76 years old) treated by breast-conserving surgery adjuvant irradiation with or without systemic therapy was applied. On the first and the last day of radiotherapy they were given a questionnaire (Table 1) which was designed together with psychologists.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four patients with fully excised, Stage I breast cancer treated with adjuvant proton 3D-CPBI had treatment plans generated using the mixed-modality, photon-electron 3D-CPBI technique. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, planning target volumes (PTVs; lumpectomy site plus 1.5-2.0 cm margin) and prescribed dose (32 Gy) were held constant. Plans were optimized for PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Proton and mixed-modality plans both provided acceptable PTV coverage with 95% of the PTV receiving 90% of the prescribed dose in all cases. Both techniques also provided excellent dose homogeneity with a dose maximum exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose in only one case. Proton 3D-CPBI reduced the volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose by an average of 36%. Statistically significant reductions in the volume of total ipsilateral breast receiving 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the prescribed dose were also observed. The use of protons resulted in small, but statistically significant, reductions in the radiation dose delivered to 5%, 10%, and 20% of ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart. The nontarget breast tissue dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI were not dependent on tumor location, breast size, PTV size, or the ratio of PTV to breast volume. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to photon-electron 3D-CPBI, proton 3D-CPBI significantly reduces the volume of irradiated nontarget breast tissue. Both approaches to accelerated partial breast irradiation offer exceptional lung and heart sparing

Fifteen patients with urinary malignant tumors were treated by proton irradiation during the period from June, 1985 to March, 1989 at Particle Radiation Medical Center, University of Tsukuba. Four patients were with renal cell carcinoma, five with prostatic cancer and six with bladder cancer. Treatment results were assessed by change in tumor size either three or six months after the irradiation. In all the four cases with renal cell carcinoma, the tumor sizes were found to be unchanged without any enlargement. Of the five cases with prostatic cancer, two showed that the treatment was effective and the tumor sizes in the other three cases were found to be unchanged. In three of the six cases with bladder cancer the tumors disappeared while the treatment was found effective in two other and it did not cause any enlargement of the tumor in the remaining one. Although local control of the tumor was successful in all the cases, one patient with prostatic cancer and three with bladder cancer died of cancer. Various side effects, such as radiation cystitis, were observed. This prospective therapy is expected to replace the conventional photon therapy. However, some improvement is needed to make full use of the advantageous properties in dose distribution. Combination therapy with other general therapy is required for some cases

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and February 1997, 24 patients with histopathologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were treated to 15 fractions within 5 weeks in a step-wise dose-escalation study. The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92% and 92%, 81% and 50%, and 81% and 25% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy appears safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92% and 92%, 81% and 50%, and 81% and 25% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy appears safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional clinical studies using a larger subject group are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and February 1997, 24 patients with histopathologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were treated to 15 fractions within 5 weeks in a step-wise dose-escalation study. The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively.

METHODS AND MATERIALS : Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p < 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

Therefore, X-ray scatter and neutron radiation as well as the impact of the primary dose distribution on secondary cancer incidence are analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential and a plateau dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 30 patients who received radiation therapy of prostate cancer. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used in eleven patients, another eleven patients received IMRT with 6-MV photons, and eight patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. The treatment plans were recalculated with 15-MV and 18-MV photons. Secondary cancer risk was estimated based on the OED for the different treatment techniques. RESULTS: A modest increase of 15% radiation-induced cancer results from IMRT using low energies (6 MV), compared to conventional four-field planning with 15-MV photons (plateau dose-response: 1%). The probability to develop a secondary cancer increases with IMRT of higher energies by 20% and 60% for 15 MV and 18 MV, respectively (plateau dose-response: 2% and 30%). The use of spot-scanned protons can reduce secondary cancer incidence as much as 50% (independent of dose-response). CONCLUSION: By including the primary dose distribution into the analysis of radiation-induced cancer incidence, the resulting increase in risk for secondary cancer using modern treatment techniques such as IMRT is not as dramatic as expected from earlier studies. By using 6-MV photons, only a moderate risk increase is expected. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice in regard to secondary cancer incidence

Irradiated tumors showed more likely necrosis (p = 0.01) had balloon cells (p = 0.01), and inflammatory infiltrate (p = 0.05). In the irradiated group, the prevalence of tumor blood vessel damage was higher (p = 0.0002) and mitotic figures were fewer (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that proton beam irradiation damages tumor cells and alters the tumor's capacity for cellular reproduction. It damages blood vessels leading to tumor necrosis. It induces an inflammatory response of unknown effects. Radiosensitivity of choroidal melanomas cannot be assessed using conventional histologic methods. However, tumor necrosis, mitotic activity and rate of balloon cells can help to establish tumoral sensitivity to irradiation

The analysis was limited to women for whom a radium body burden measurement had been obtained and who were married prior to age 45 (n = 603). Internal radiation dose to the ovary was calculated based on initial intakes of radium-226 and radium-228, average ovarian mass, number and energy of alpha particles emitted, fraction of energy absorbed within the ovary, effective retention integrals and estimated photon irradiation. Time between marriage and pregnancy, number of pregnancies and number of live births served as surrogates for fertility. Radiation appeared to have no effect on fertility at estimated cumulative ovarian dose equivalents below 5 Sv; above this dose, however, statistically significant declines in both number of pregnancies and live births were observed. These trends persisted after multivariable adjustment for potential confounding variables and after exclusion of subjects contributing a potential classification or selection bias to the study. Additionally, the high-dose group experienced fewer live births than would have been expected based on population rates. There were no differences in time to first pregnancy between high- and low-dose groups. These results are consistent with earlier studies of gamma-ray exposures and suggest that exposure to high doses of radiation from internally deposited radium reduces fertility rather than inducing sterility

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1994 and February 2002, 48 patients with histologically confirmed malignant gliomas (16 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 32 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical study. The treatment involved the application of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks of XRT, followed by CRT at 8 fractions/2 weeks. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) were administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) concurrently in weeks 1, 4, or 5 of XRT. The carbon ion dose was increased from 16.8 to 24.8 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 10% incremental steps (16.8, 18.4, 20.0, 22.4, and 24.8 GyE, respectively). RESULTS: There was no Grade 3 or higher acute reaction in the brain. The late reactions included four cases of Grade 2 brain morbidity and four cases of Grade 2 brain reaction among 48 cases. The median survival time (MST) of AA patients was 35 months and that of GBM patients 17 months (p = 0.0035). The median progression-free survival and MST of GBM showed 4 and 7 months for the low-dose group, 7 and 19 months for the middle-dose group, and 14 and 26 months for the high-dose group. CONCLUSION: The results of combined therapy using XRT, ACNU chemotherapy, and CRT showed the potential efficacy of CRT for malignant gliomas in terms of the improved survival rate in those patients who received higher carbon doses

1	184	Pilot evaluation of cytokine levels in patients undergoing radiotherapy for brain tumor	Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cytokines/bl [Blood], Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Female, Growth Substances/bl [Blood], Humans, Interleukin-1/bl [Blood], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Pilot Projects, Radiotherapy, Research, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/me [Metabolism]	This study was undertaken to evaluate plasma levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 3 pediatric and 14 adult patients receiving radiotherapy for brain tumor. Patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, schwannoma, and lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the brain were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after treatment with conventional photon and/or proton radiation; samples from healthy volunteers served as controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantitate the cytokines. Before irradiation, most patients had greater amounts of one or more of the cytokines compared with the mean obtained for control plasma. This was especially striking in patients with chondrosarcoma; the mean values for TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, bFGF, and EGF were 1458, 1289, 332, and 92% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. After irradiation, bFGF and total TGF-beta 1 decreased in the majority of tested subjects. In contrast, IL-1 beta was detected only in pediatric patients (all with astrocytoma) and its levels after radiation were 33 to 67% higher than at pretreatment. EGF was found in four patients; post-treatment values were 125 to 608% higher in three of the individuals. These data show that cytokines are present at elevated concentrations in the blood circulation of patients with certain types of brain tumors and that changes in their levels can be detected after radiotherapy. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether these findings contribute to morbidity or therapeutic outcome

Mode of action and problems are discussed and published results reported. Human tumour cells obtained of biopsies from our patients before the onset of treatments were investigated. The short time cell cultures were treated either with hyperthermia or irradiation alone or with combinations under the same conditions as the clinical treatments. We could clearly demonstrate that cell cultures of human origin respond to irradiation or hyperthermia. But the effect was limited and only cultures treated with combined modalities did not relapse. There is hope that mega-voltage radiation complemented with hyperthermia have a similar effect as high-LET-radiation. Side effects have been moderate so far using an extended clinical use

For the current report, the expanded role of external beam RT in the setting of HCC from palliation to cure was reviewed. A systematic literature search was undertaken using the MEDLINE data base and secondary references to identify peer-reviewed, English-language articles that reported clinical outcomes after external beam RT alone or in combination with other treatments for HCC. Abstracts from the 2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, American Gastrointestinal Association, and Society of Surgical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium also were included in the search. More than 60 articles reporting on clinical outcomes among patients who received RT for HCC have been published since 1990, including 20 articles that described unique sets of at least 15 patients. RT was used for palliation, to improve local control, and with curative intent in a wide spectrum of patients who most often were unsuitable for surgery and other treatments. Pain reduction following RT was noted in approximately 75% of patients with bone metastases from HCC who received RT. For patients with liver-confined disease treated with conformal RT, proton beam RT, and/or image guided RT with or without transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), local control response rates ranged from 40% to 90%, and the median survival ranges from 10 months to 25 months. For patients with HCC who had portal vein thrombus, the median survival after RT to treat the thrombus and/or the hepatic tumor with or without TACE ranged from 5.3 months to 9.7 months. Although outcomes after high-dose conformal RT for liver-confined HCC were excellent, the potential survival benefit of RT should be tested in randomized controlled trials that require international collaboration. 2006 American Cancer Society [References: 85]

Gafchromic EBT radiochromic film is one of the newest radiation-induced auto-developing photon and electron-beam analysis films available for therapeutic radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy applications. EBT films can be particularly useful in TSET; due to patient morphology, underdosed regions typically occur, and the radiochromic film represents a suitable candidate for monitoring them. In this study, TSET was applied to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The technique for TSET was implemented by using an electron beam with a nominal energy of 6MeV. The patient was treated in a standing position using dual angled fields in order to obtain the greatest dose uniformity along the patient's longitudinal axis. The electron beam energy was degraded by a PMMA filter. The in vivo dose distribution was determined through the use of EBT films, as well as of thermoluminescent dosimeters for comparison (TLDs). EBT results showed a reasonable agreement with TLDs data

0	335	In vivo EBT radiochromic film dosimetry of electron beam for Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET)	Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Film Dosimetry, Humans, Italy, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skin Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	EBT radiochromic films were used to determine skin-dose maps for patients undergone Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET). Gafchromic EBT radiochromic film is one of the newest radiation-induced auto-developing photon and electron-beam analysis films available for therapeutic radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy applications. EBT films can be particularly useful in TSET; due to patient morphology, underdosed regions typically occur, and the radiochromic film represents a suitable candidate for monitoring them. In this study, TSET was applied to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The technique for TSET was implemented by using an electron beam with a nominal energy of 6MeV. The patient was treated in a standing position using dual angled fields in order to obtain the greatest dose uniformity along the patient's longitudinal axis. The electron beam energy was degraded by a PMMA filter. The in vivo dose distribution was determined through the use of EBT films, as well as of thermoluminescent dosimeters for comparison (TLDs).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance

Although this emotional syndrome has been seen in association with several different pathological entities, review of the literature failed to identify its occurrence as the only clinical expression of angiographically occult brainstem vascular malformation, or as a solitary symptom in any disease. Our data suggest that pathological laughing and crying can occur without any other manifestation of pseudobulbar palsy. An attempt is made to correlate this patient's clinical and radiological findings. This case was treated by stereotactic Bragg-peak proton beam therapy

1	2922	The time course of irradiation changes in proton beam-treated uveal melanomas	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Autopsy, Boston, Cyclotrons, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Fibrosis, Humans, Inflammation, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Prevalence, Protons, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveitis/et [Etiology], Uveitis/pa [Pathology]	BACKGROUND: Although histopathologic changes in uveal melanomas treated by irradiation have been well characterized, the timing of these effects after irradiation has not been previously evaluated. METHODS: The series consisted of a total of 92 eyes with uveal melanoma, enucleated at various intervals after proton irradiation (range, 1 month to 8 years) due to complications (n = 66) or tumor growth (n = 22), or at autopsy (n = 4). Study slides were read, using a standard protocol, by two pathologists masked to the timing of the enucleation after irradiation and the reason for the surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of inflammation decreased whereas fibrosis increased with time from 15% of cases enucleated within 12 months (early cases) to 61% of those enucleated more than 30 months (late cases) after irradiation (P for trend = 0.0005). Tumor necrosis and blood vessel damage occurred early, and the prevalence of these changes was constant over time. Excluding tumors with evidence of growth after irradiation, mitotic figures became progressively less common as the interval between irradiation and enucleation increased (P for trend = 0.015); no mitotic figures were present in 40 high-power fields more than 30 months after irradiation. CONCLUSION: Histopathologic changes in irradiated melanomas vary according to the time elapsed since irradiation. Inflammation decreases with time whereas fibrosis becomes more prevalent with time after irradiation. Among controlled tumors, mitotic figures appear only in recently irradiated tumors

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

0	826	Radiotherapy for local control of osteosarcoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Bone Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Bone Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Child, Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Osteosarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Osteosarcoma/su [Surgery], Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Local control of osteosarcoma in patients for whom a resection with satisfactory margins is not achieved can be difficult. This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05). No definitive dose-response relationship for local control of tumor was seen, although the local control rate was 71% +/- 9% for 32 patients receiving doses > or =55 Gy vs. 53.6% +/- 20.1% for 9 patients receiving <55 Gy (p = 0.11). Of 15 patients with tumors >5.3 cm, 9 received doses > or =55 Gy and the local control rate was 80% +/- 17.9%, and 6 received doses <55 Gy with a local control rate of only 50% +/- 25% at 5 years (p = 0.16). Among patients who underwent gross total resection, the local control rate was 77.5% +/- 9.95% in 22 patients with negative margins vs 66.7% +/- 27.2% in 3 patients with positive margins (p = 0.54). Two patients had unknown margin status. CONCLUSION: RT can help provide local control of osteosarcoma for patients in whom surgical resection with widely, negative margins is not possible. It appears to be more effective in situations in which microscopic or minimal residual disease is being treated

Of 15 patients with tumors >5.3 cm, 9 received doses > or =55 Gy and the local control rate was 80% +/- 17.9%, and 6 received doses <55 Gy with a local control rate of only 50% +/- 25% at 5 years (p = 0.16). Among patients who underwent gross total resection, the local control rate was 77.5% +/- 9.95% in 22 patients with negative margins vs 66.7% +/- 27.2% in 3 patients with positive margins (p = 0.54). Two patients had unknown margin status. CONCLUSION: RT can help provide local control of osteosarcoma for patients in whom surgical resection with widely, negative margins is not possible. It appears to be more effective in situations in which microscopic or minimal residual disease is being treated

This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05).

Since January 1991 we treated 3 retinoblastomas with proton beam at the cyclotron of Louvain-la-Neuve. Results are encouraging. The short term outcome seems comparable to phototherapy, but the long term expectancy is better, because of reduced secondary malignancies. Proton beam treatment for selected retinoblastomas seems a good alternative to external radiotherapy

In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT

Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT

The coordinates of specific target landmarks, i.e., bone, calcium deposition or catheters, on baseline CT scans were compared with those measured on control scans. Since the PLATO-SRS system yields 3 coordinates for each target, the final error is calculated by the evaluation of the shift of the different coordinates. The mean error reported for the first material (ORFIT) was 5 mm (13/23 patients). This margin of error is too high and was considered unacceptable; a second material was then tested. The latter, which is not recyclable and softens at higher temperatures, exhibited a mean error of 2.5 mm (10/23 patients), which allows daily repositioning of greater reliability. Treatment was repeated in 4/20 arcs in all, which number depended mainly on fraction size. Correct lesion location and patient positioning were allowed by laser landmarks on the mask made directly on the treatment couch. The laser too was checked before each treatment session, i.e., preferentially at the end of an ordinary working day

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A homogeneous group of 136 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate were treated with the Fermilab high-energy neutron beam at three dose levels: 19, 20.4, and 21 Gy, using the same treatment plan and fractionation scheme for all patients. RESULTS: Tumor control rates were about 83% at the three dose levels studied. However, the normal tissue complication rate (late sequelae) varied with dose: 0 out of 5 at 19 Gy, 5 out of 58 (8.6%) at 20.4 Gy, and 9 out of 73 (12.3%) at 21 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron therapy to the pelvis reveals a steep dose-response function for late effects with a coefficient of variation of only 11%. This is lower than that usually observed with photons or with less uniform clinical data sets, and may be characteristic for well-planned high-LET radiotherapy

In this work, micronucleus dose-response curves for lymphocytes of normal and AT individuals, exposed in G(zero) to low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons, are compared. After gamma-irradiation, the micronucleus yields for AT lymphocytes are strongly increased compared with controls. The micronucleus dose-response curve for AT cells shows a linear dependence instead of a linear-quadratic one which is found for normal cells. After neutron irradiation, the increase in micronucleus yield above controls is less pronounced than with gamma-rays and the micronucleus dose-response curves are linear, as expected. The high increase in micronucleus yield compared with controls after gamma-irradiation further suggests the application of the micronucleus assay as a diagnostic tool for ataxia telangiectasia

In four cases in which detailed microscopic examinations were performed, radiation induced tumour necrosis was evident but in all four cases viable tumour cells were also observed. No abnormalities that could be attributed to radiation were observed in brain tissue free from tumour. The therapeutic results were comparable to the results achieved by other modern therapies. The results support the view that the RBE of high-energy protons is similar to that for 60Co radiation. It is suggested that a larger radiation dose, delivered by a homogeneous, well-defined proton field could possibly result in an improved therapeutic result without undue risk of injury to normal brain tissue

An intensity-controlled magnetic raster scanner together with a synchrotron allowing fast energy variation enable a unique method of purely active dose shaping in three dimensions. This contribution describes the necessary steps to establish a treatment planning system for this novel modality. We discuss the requirements for the physical beam model and the radiobiological model. Based on these we chose to implement a home-grown pencil beam model to describe the ion-tissue interaction and the Local Effect Model to calculate the RBE voxel-by-voxel. Given the large number of degrees of freedom biological dose optimization must be achieved by means of inverse treatment planning. All ion-related aspects are collected in our TRiP98 software. Biological dosimetry measuring cell survival in two dimensions turns out to be a good way to verify the model predictions as well as the actual irradiation procedure. We show a patient example and outline the future steps towards a dedicated clinic facility for all light ions

We have studied the severe complications occurring after treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. Four groups of patients were compared: Group 1 (80 patients) had treatment with surgery alone for mobile and resectable tumors; Group 2 (23 patients) had treatment with high dose preoperative irradiation followed by surgical resection for tumors which were fixed to adjacent structures and initially unresectable for cure; Group 3 (24 patients, primary disease) and Group 4 (17 patients, locally recurrent disease) had locally advanced tumors as in Group 2 but were treated with IORT after preoperative irradiation and attempted surgical resection. All but 3 complications occurred within one year of therapy. Severe complications were seen in 16% of patients in Group 1, 35% in Group 2, 21% in Group 3 and 47% in Group 4 (32% in Groups 3 and 4 combined). There was a statistically insignificant increase (p = .10) in the complication rate in all irradiated patients (locally advanced tumors) compared to surgery alone (clinically mobile tumors). These data indicate no increase in severe complications with the use of IORT. If the ongoing studies continue to show improved local control with the use of IORT, expanded use of this modality may be warranted

The treatment of bladder cancer with 60 converging pion beams was expected to have certain dose-distribution advantages with possibly fewer side effects than other high linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation therapies, such as neutrons. RESULTS. Early results were promising: 20 of 24 (83%) evaluable patients with sessile invasive bladder carcinomas had clinically complete responses. However, only 3 of 10 (30%) evaluable patients with superficial bladder tumors had clinically complete responses. This article reports the long-term follow-up (6-8 years) of these patients with emphasis on the late side effects of pion radiation therapy. Thirty-eight of the 41 (93%) patients treated died after a median survival time of 17 months (range, 4-98 months). Seventeen (45%) died of metastatic disease (in two instances, this was combined with a local recurrence) 5-27 months after radiation therapy. Four (10%) died of locally progressive disease, and eight (21%) died of late side effects of radiation therapy 9-98 months after treatment. All these patients were treated with more than 33 pion Gy and had generally a symptom-free interval of 9-18 months. The observed side effects were severe, consisting of chronic inflammation and vascular damage in the pelvic region often followed by ulceration, fistulas, and perforations throughout the intestines. In 11 patients, cystectomy and urinary diversion was necessary because of excessive fibrosis and bladder shrinkage. In eight patients, a colostomy was required for stenotic inflammatory disease, necrosis, and perforations of the intestines. The remaining nine patients (24%) died of causes unrelated to the primary disease 4-60 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the first Phase I/II trial using the Swiss piotron showed a high complete response rate in patients with sessile bladder cancers but also a high incidence of local recurrences and severe, in some instances lethal side effects. Although it is expected that these results will be the basis for future improvements, particularly regarding dosing and fractionation, this experience emphasizes the need for a sufficiently long observation period before reaching conclusions about any high LET treatment, such as neutron, pion, or heavy ion radiation therapy

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen cases of metastatic melanoma involving intraocular tissues, 6 cases of metastatic melanoma in the orbit, and 1 case of metastatic melanoma involving both the eye and the orbit, treated in Lausanne between 1986 and 2002, were identified from the computer files of the ocular oncology and orbitopalpebral surgery units of Jules Gonin Hospital. METHODS: The analysis is based on the demographic data concerning these patients, clinical data concerning the tumor, the treatment applied, the outcome, and the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation of intraocular and orbital metastasis, interval between primary tumor and ocular metastasis, survival of the patients, evaluation of various therapeutic protocols. RESULTS: Intraocular metastases (14 cases, 15 eyes) were situated in the choroid in 11 cases (isolated lesion, 6 cases; multiple lesions, 3 cases; diffuse involvement, 2 cases), in the iris and ciliary body in 2 cases, and in the retina and vitreous in 2 other cases. The primary tumor was a cutaneous melanoma in 8 cases, a melanoma of the contralateral eye in 3 cases, a mucosal melanoma in 1 case, and was unknown in 2 cases. The mean interval between the diagnosis of ocular metastases and the patient's death was 8.8 months (range, 1-48 months). The primary tumor in the 7 cases of orbital metastases was a cutaneous melanoma in 5 cases, a uveal melanoma in the contralateral eye in 1 case, and was unknown in 1 case. The mean interval between the diagnosis of orbital metastases and death was 19.7 months (range, 5-48 months). The patients were treated by various protocols. The best results, in terms of both local tumor control and preservation of visual function, were obtained with circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or external beam irradiation, depending on the site and extent of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic melanomas to the eye and orbit are rare and generally occur in patients with disseminated metastases during the terminal stages of the disease, with a short life expectancy. Treatment is palliative and, among the various possible treatment options, circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or global photon beam radiotherapy, at relatively high irradiation doses, seems to achieve the most favorable results

1	65	Whole-body dose from tomotherapy delivery	Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Dosage, Scattering,Radiation, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Whole-Body Counting	PURPOSE: To measure whole-body dose in tomotherapy of the head and neck region resulting from internal patient scatter and linear accelerator leakage. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatments are performed using a commercial computer-controlled intensity modulated radiation therapy planning and delivery system (Peacock, NOMOS Corp.) and a 6-MV linear accelerator (Clinac 6/100, Varian Corp.). The patient dose outside the treatment field is measured in a water-equivalent phantom using thermoluminescent dosimetry. The whole-body dose components from internal scatter and leakage are separately determined. The use of fixed-portal leakage and scattered radiation measurements to estimate the whole-body dose from tomotherapy is evaluated. RESULTS: The internally scattered dose is significant near the target, but becomes negligible relative to the leakage dose beyond 15 cm from the target. Dose at 10 cm from the target volume, due to internal scatter and leakage, is approximately 2.5% of the total target dose, reducing to 0.5% at 30 cm. The measured dose is relatively uniform throughout the phantom. CONCLUSION: The whole-body dose equivalent from a tomotherapy treatment is greater than that from conventional radiation therapy. Further studies are required to assess the trade-off between improved dose distribution conformality and a possible slight increase in radiation-induced fatal malignancies. The accuracy of using fixed-portal leakage and scattered dose measurements to estimate the whole-body dose from tomotherapy treatments is adequate, if the appropriate fixed-portal field size equivalent is used	
0	596	Neutron scattered dose equivalent to a fetus from proton radiotherapy of the mother	Air, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant,Newborn, Maternal Exposure, Mental Retardation/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neutrons, Phantoms,Imaging, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Trimester,Second, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Risk, Survivors	Scattered neutron dose equivalent to a representative point for a fetus is evaluated in an anthropomorphic phantom of the mother undergoing proton radiotherapy. The effect on scattered neutron dose equivalent to the fetus of changing the incident proton beam energy, aperture size, beam location, and air gap between the beam delivery snout and skin was studied for both a small field snout and a large field snout. Measurements of the fetus scattered neutron dose equivalent were made by placing a neutron bubble detector 10 cm below the umbilicus of an anthropomorphic Rando phantom enhanced by a wax bolus to simulate a second trimester pregnancy. The neutron dose equivalent in milliSieverts (mSv) per proton treatment Gray increased with incident proton energy and decreased with aperture size, distance of the fetus representative point from the field edge, and increasing air gap. Neutron dose equivalent to the fetus varied from 0.025 to 0.450 mSv per proton Gray for the small field snout and from 0.097 to 0.871 mSv per proton Gray for the large field snout. There is likely to be no excess risk to the fetus of severe mental retardation for a typical proton treatment of 80 Gray to the mother since the scattered neutron dose to the fetus of 69.7 mSv is well below the lower confidence limit for the threshold of 300 mGy observed for the occurrence of severe mental retardation in prenatally exposed Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, based on the linear no threshold hypothesis, and this same typical treatment for the mother, the excess risk to the fetus of radiation induced cancer death in the first 10 years of life is 17.4 per 10,000 children

Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%.

A total of 84 patients underwent cataract extraction between 2 months and 11 years after irradiation. One year after cataract extraction, approximately half of the patients had visual acuity of 20/100 or better, and approximately one third had an acuity of 20/40 or better. Larger tumor size was highly correlated with poor visual outcome 1 year after extraction. Six patients underwent enucleation after cataract removal, five due to blind, painful eyes and one due to continued growth of a previously undiagnosed ring melanoma. The rate of metastases was not higher among patients who underwent cataract extraction (adjusted rate ratio, 0.83). Results suggest that cataract extraction offers improvement of vision in selected eyes previously irradiated for a uveal melanoma, without adding to the risk of metastases among patients undergoing the procedure

The mean age of patients was 37 years, the male/female ratio 1:1.1. The most frequent complaints were diplopia with oculomotor disorders (51%), headache (31%), and decreased hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus with statoacusticus dysfunction (21%). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 27 months. The chondrosarcomas were located in the petrosal bone in 37% (47 cases), in the occipital bone and clivus in 23% (30 cases), in the sphenoid bone in 20% (25 cases) and to a lesser extent in frontal, ethmoidal, and parietal bones (14%). In 6% (eight cases) the primary location was in dural tissue. Radiological examinations showed bone destruction and variable calcification (CT), involvement of neuronal and vascular structures (MRI), and mostly hypovascularity on angiography. On histological examination 51% of tumours were classified as grade I, 11% grade II, 30% mesenchymal, and 8% myxoid. The mesenchymal type was the most malignant as illustrated by a strong tendency to intradural and cerebral growth and possibly occurrence in younger age groups. The treatment of choice until recently was surgery because of the critical location and local aggressive nature. Regrowth of tumour after surgery occurred in 53% of the patients (average after 32 months). Charged particle irradiation gave a five year survival of 83-94% and a local control rate of 78%-91%. Both in surgery and radiotherapy there is treatment related morbidity and mortality that should be considered when offering these therapies. Recent promising results imply that charged particle radiotherapy, in combination with surgery, may be the therapeutical choice of the future. [References: 46]

The absorbed dose standard for ocular proton therapy beams at HCL was based on a fluence measurement with a Faraday cup (FC). A majority of proton therapy centers worldwide, however, use an absorbed dose standard that is based on an ionization chamber (IC) technique. The ion chamber calibration is deduced from a measurement in a reference 60Co photon field together with a calculated correction factor that takes into account differences in a chamber's response in 60Co and proton fields. In this work, we implemented an ionization chamber-based absolute dosimetry system for the HCL ocular beamline based on the recommendations given in Report 59 by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements. Comparative measurements revealed that the FC system yields an absorbed dose to water value that is 1.1% higher than was obtained with the IC system. That difference is small compared with the experimental uncertainties and is clinically insignificant. In June of 1998, we adopted the IC-based method as our standard practice for the ocular beam

Some adverse effects such as optic neuropathy can compromise the visual outcome. We were interested in determining the risk factors for radiation papillopathy. Since there is currently no effective therapy, this is an interesting way to improve prevention of optic neuropathy. Six hundred sixty-two eyes had more than 24 month follow-up after proton-beam irradiation for uveal melanoma. In five hundred twenty-two cases, the clinical examination of the optic nerve head by ophthalmoscopy was possible. One-hundred eleven optic discs were pathologic, whereas 411 remained disease-free. Retrospective study of these two groups allowed to quantify the risk factors for optic neuropathy. The irradiation of more than 2mm of optic nerve at 30 Grays-equivalents appeared to be the major risk factor for optic neuropathy. For a given irradiation dose, the observed pattern of clinical responses was heterogeneous. These results are discussed and compared to the previous published reports. Visual results and life prognosis are also discussed, considering the optic nerve head status. Proton-beam therapy can preserve the optic nerve when the tumor location allows to keep it away from the irradiation-field. Patients must be informed about the risk of optic neuropathy after proton-beam irradiation

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome

The procedure requires six injections of local anesthetic and application of a stereotactic frame by fixation into the outer table of the skull, and has been used during the past 20 yr to treat over 1,000 patients with cerebral AVMs. No effort was made to control blood pressure. Blood pressure increased during administration of the local anesthetic and application of the frame. Maximum systolic and mean arterial pressures averaged 160 +/- 17 and 118 +/- 7 mmHg (mean +/- SD), respectively. This represented an average increase of 44 mmHg (38%) in systolic pressure and 32 mmHg (37%) in mean blood pressure at some point during the procedure (P less than 0.01 compared with pretreatment control pressures). Systolic pressure increased more than 60 mmHg in 21% of patients. Nevertheless, none of these 56 patients nor any of the more than 1,000 patients treated in similar fashion suffered a clinically evident AVM hemorrhage during the procedure. Since the treatment protocol has not changed materially during the past 20 yr, the authors assume that most patients treated in this fashion developed a similar degree of hypertension and conclude from this large clinical experience that moderate arterial hypertension does not precipitate spontaneous hemorrhage of intracranial AVMs

Their general aim is to increase local tumor control rates while keeping the radiation induced complications below desired thresholds. IMRT is currently widely introduced in clinical practice. However, the more complicated IMPT is still under development. Especially, spot- scanning techniques integrated in rotating gantries that can deliver proton or light ion-beams to a radiation target from any direction will be available in the near future. We describe the basic concepts of intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT). Starting from the potential advantages of hadron therapy inverse treatment planning strategies are discussed for various dose delivery techniques of IMPT. Of special interest are the techniques of distal edge tracking (DET) and 3D-scanning. After the introduction of these concepts a study of comparative inverse treatment planning is presented. The study aims to identify the potential advantages of achievable physical dose distributions with proton and carbon beams, if different dose delivery techniques are employed. Moreover, a comparison to standard photon IMRT is performed. The results of the study are summarized as: i) IMRT with photon beams is a strong competitor to intensity modulated radiotherapy with charged particles. The most obvious benefit observed for charged particles is the reduction of medium and low doses in organs at risk. ii) The 3D-scanning technique could not improve the dosimetric results achieved with DET, although 10-15 times more beam spots were employed for 3D-scanning than for DET. However, concerns may arise about the application of DET, if positioning errors of the patient or organ movements have to be accounted for. iii) Replacing protons with carbon ions leads to further improvements of the physical dose distributions. However, the additional degree of improvement due to carbon ions is modest. The main clinical potential of heavy ion beams is probably related to their radiobiological properties

METHODS: A patient experienced persistent unilateral panuveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. Inflammation and pressure worsened after cataract extraction and lens implantation. Diagnostic vitrectomy was non-revealing. RESULTS: Repeat vitrectomy and lens implant removal revealed a ciliary body mass, suggestive of melanoma. Ultrasonography and clinical evaluation by the retinal oncologists supported this diagnosis. The uveitis persisted despite aggressive medical treatments, including methotrexate. Proton beam irradiation of the melanoma led to resolution of uveitis and restoration of normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Ciliary body melanoma can present as chronic uveitis and refractory glaucoma	
0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy.

1	2395	The Clatterbridge high-energy neutron facility: dosimetry intercomparisons	Belgium, Calibration, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Manikins, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Universities, Washington	Dosimetry intercomparisons have been performed between the Clatterbridge high-energy neutron facility and the following institutions, all employing beams with similar neutron energies: Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium; University of Washington, Seattle, USA; MD Anderson Hospital, Houston, USA; and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, USA. The purpose of the intercomparison was to provide a basis for the exchange of dose-response data and to facilitate the involvement of Clatterbridge in collaborative clinical trials. Tissue-equivalent ionization chambers were used by the participants in each intercomparison to compare measurements of total (neutron plus gamma) absorbed dose in the host institution's neutron beam, following calibration of the chambers in a reference photon beam. The effects of differences in exposure standards, chamber responses in the neutron beams and protocol-dependent dosimetry factors were all investigated. It was concluded that the overall difference in the measurement of absorbed dose relative to that determined by the Clatterbridge group was less than 2%

This article reviews the use of a commercial system, the Peacock system, which uses a special multileaf collimator (MIMiC) to deliver the dose distribution using arc therapy and segmented fields, similar to a moving strip. Although initially designed for stereotactic radiosurgery, this system has been employed to treat various body sites. More than 300 patients have been treated at our institution in the past 4 years, mainly for cranial, head-and-neck, and prostate tumors. Presently, we treat 40 to 45 patients per day with this technology using two linear accelerators operating with 10 MV and 15 MV x-rays, as Peacock has become a standard therapy procedure. Cases are presented that show the unique ability of IMRT to deliver conformal dose distributions. Why this type of technology can become a standard procedure and why it is cost-effective therapy for both the institution and the patient are discussed. [References: 17]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In gastrointestinal cancers, it is assessed that at least 345 patients, mainly non-resectable rectal cancers, oesophageal and liver cancers, are eligible. Great uncertainties do however exist both in the number of patients with gastrointestinal cancers suitable for radiation therapy, and in the proportion of those where proton beams may give sufficiently better results

To design a new protocol that employs epithermal neutron beams in the treatment of glioma patients, we examined the relationship between the radiation dose, histological tumor grade, and clinical outcome. Since 1968, 183 patients with different kinds of brain tumors were treated by BNCT; for this retrospective study, we selected 105 patients with glial tumors who were treated in Japan between 1978 and 1997. In the analysis of side effects due to radiation, we included all the 159 patients treated between 1977 and 2001. With respect to the radiation dose (i.e. physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction), the new protocol prescribes a minimum tumor volume dose of 15 Gy or, alternatively, a minimum target volume dose of 18 Gy. The maximum vascular dose should not exceed 15 Gy (physical dose of boron n-alpha reaction) and the total amount of gamma rays should remain below 10 Gy, including core gamma rays from the reactor and capture gamma in brain tissue. The outcomes for 10 patients who were treated by the new protocol using a new mode composed of thermal and epithermal neutrons are reported

Because of the program s success, the need for a dedicated radiosurgery unit in Ohio and the desire to treat functional disorders, the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) obtained the first Gamma Knife in the state of Ohio. Based on the previous volume of patients for radiosurgery, it was estimated that 75-100 patients would be treated during the first year of operation. However, during the first calendar year, 214 treatments were performed on 205 patients, which far exceeded expectations. The success of the CCHS Gamma Knife Center can be attributed to an increase in a number of factors. These included marketing efforts, patient awareness, increased use for functional disorders, physician understanding of radiosurgery, use by qualified nonaffiliated radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons, and outpatient delivery (95% with the Gamma Knife vs <5% with the LINAC). With proper planning, education, and awareness, the opening of a Gamma Knife Center can greatly increase the volume of radiosurgery performed when compared with a LINAC-based program

The median follow-up was 5.4 years, and no patient was lost to follow-up. All tumors showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 35% and 20/100 or better in 58%. Eight eyes were enucleated because of complications. Metastasis developed in 26 patients (20.5%) from 3 months to 7 years after treatment. Results indicate that proton irradiation is quite successful for achieving local control of uveal melanomas. A large proportion of the treated eyes maintained useful vision. Five-year follow-up data indicate that proton irradiation has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastasis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities

Two phase I/II clinical studies on the carbon beam radiation treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were carried out in our institution from October 1996 to February 1999. The dose-limiting toxicity was found to be radiation pneumonia. In the first protocol, 47 patients received 18 fractions of increasing doses from 59.4 GyE by 10% over 6 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was found to be 95.4 GyE, while the complete tumor control dose was 85.6 GyE. In the second protocol, 34 patients received 9 fractions of in creasing doses from 68.4 GyE by 5% over 3 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was 79.2 GyE, and the complete tumor control dose was > 68.9 GyE. The 4-year survival rate estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 56% for patients receiving the first protocol. Because a higher local control rate was achieved in the second protocol, the 5-year survival rate is estimated to be higher and similar to that achieved after surgery. Another phase II clinical study in patients with stage INSCLC is ongoing. Heavy-particle radiotherapy is a new modality for the treatment of lung cancer which holds promise for the 21st century.

The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. METHODS: Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. RESULTS: The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research

0	455	The influence of metal artefacts on the range of ion beams	Artifacts, Biophysics, Dental Implants, Germany, Gold, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Metals, Pelvic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Prostheses and Implants, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]	The influence of artefacts due to metal implants on the range of ion beams is investigated, using a geometrically well-defined head and pelvic phantom together with inserts from steel, titanium and tungsten. The ranges along various beam paths including artefacts were calculated from the TPS and compared to known calculations for phantoms without any insert. In the head phantom, beams intersecting the streak artefacts lead to errors in the range of around or below 1%, which is mainly due to a cancellation of various effects. Beams through the metal or close to it show an underestimation of 3.5% of the range for tungsten. For the pelvic phantom, a large underestimation of the range is observed for a lateral path through the metal insert. In the case of tungsten and steel, range errors of -5% and -18% are observed, respectively. Such beam paths are typically used for pelvic tumours in radiotherapy with ion beams. For beams in the anterior-posterior direction through the inserts, an overestimation of ion ranges of up to 3% for titanium and 8% for steel is expected, respectively. Beam paths outside the metal insert show a large cancellation for the lateral beams (leading to errors of around 1% only) and somewhat higher errors for anterior-posterior beams (around 3% for titanium and 6% for steel). The analysis of CT data of patients with dental implants of gold as compared to patients with healthy teeth also showed a significant effect of the artefacts on the distribution of HU in the data, namely a redistribution of HU to higher and lower values as compared to patients with healthy teeth. The corresponding mean range variation was a 2.5% reduction in the data with artefacts as compared to the data without artefacts. It is concluded that beam paths through metal implants should generally be avoided in proton and ion therapy. In this case, the underestimation of ion range due to artefacts alone may amount to 3% for dental fillings and up to 5% and 18% for hip prosthesis made of titanium and steel, respectively. It is important to note that the size of the metal inserts cannot be determined correctly from the images, so that a correction of the ranges in metal also leads to large uncertainties. Finally, it should be stressed that the stated relative deviations are strictly valid only for the investigated phantoms and can only give a rough estimate on the size of range uncertainties that may appear in real patients

However, the survival rate in them as compared to that in patients treated by intracavitary irradiation of common type, was much higher. Rectal complications were most frequent in patients treated by routine radiotherapy, bladder complications were noted in patients treated by successive administration of high activity radionuclide sources

Among the 4 eligible randomized studies including non-small-cell lung cancer patients in complete remission of stage II (N1) disease, none demonstrated a significant advantage on survival. In addition, some of these studies disclosed an apparently deleterious effect after postoperative radiotherpy. Although the modalities and the technical quality of radiotherapy and surgical resection were different for the different studies or within a given study, or in some of the older studies even obsolete, and although the precision of the outcome evaluation can be criticized, there is currently no argument for proposing postoperative radiotherapy as a routine systematic practice with conventional methods of bidimensional dosimetric planification after complete surgical resection with good quality mediastinal node dissection for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with stage II (N1) disease. However, the contribution of postoperative radiotherpy with sufficient means for performing tridimensional conformational radiotherapy with individual optimization of computerized dosimetric planification taking into account the residual respiratory function after surgery remains to be evaluated in randomized prospective studies with rigorous control of the technical quality of the surgical resection and the radiotherapy and a precise statistical analysis of the locoregional and distant events in case of incomplete surgical resection and in more advanced stage disease (parietal T3, N0, stage III N2)

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 426 ciliochoroidal melanomas that met COMS inclusion criteria for randomisation to enucleation versus radioactive plaque but were treated with either helium ions or 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: At 3 years 36.0% of eyes had 6/12 or better visual acuity. The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision

Burr Proton Therapy Center	Breast, Cyclotrons, Equipment Design, Facility Design and Construction, Humans, Massachusetts, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/cl [Classification], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Research, Research/st [Standards], Research/td [Trends]	The Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable

We described in this study the first case of petrousal bone apex chondroblastoma. METHODS: The tumor occurred in a 12-year-old girl and was revealed by left hypoacusis, vertigo, and walking instability. Computerized tomography scan depicted well-demarcated and osteolytic lesion of the left petrousal bone just before the internal acoustic meatus. The tumor was operated on by a subtemporal approach with a subtotal resection. Lesion recurred and was operated a second time by a combined approach subtemporal and translabyrinthine. This treatment was completed by radiotherapy. We used a combination of photon therapy and proton therapy. Outcome was good and free of recurrence 36 months after the second operation. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy can be particularly useful for skull base tumors frequently radioresistant and near very important structures. This case is the first one of a successful treatment by proton therapy for chondroblastoma recurrence

[Russian]	Adult, Alpha Particles/ae [Adverse Effects], Chemical Industry, Chromosome Aberrations/re [Radiation Effects], Female, Gamma Rays, Gamma Rays/ae [Adverse Effects], Humans, Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], Male, Middle Aged, Plutonium, Radiation	The origin of multiaberrant cells (MACs) was studied by comparing the structure and intensity of chromosome damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of two groups of people: workers of Siberian Chemical Plant differing in the content of plutonium-239 in their bodies, and inhabitants of a non-polluted settlement (control group). Plutonium-239 is known to be a long-lived densely-ionizing source of alpha-radiation with high linear energy delivery; therefore, it has a stronger effect on cell hereditary structures than gamma-rays. In persons with the content of plutonium-239 higher than 13 nCu, the frequency of MAC was 0.105% which at least tenfold exceeds the spontaneous level. The chromosome-type aberrations that are usually induced by ionizing radiation predominated in MACs. Our results suggest that MAC formation may be caused by internal body irradiation with the incorporated sources of densely-ionizing radiation

Hence, an improved clinical benefit is to be expected predominantly in large, hypoxic and slowly growing tumors. Since a short course of radiotherapy is required for clinical reasons, it prompted the authors to initiate a randomly controlled trial on locally advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 1999, 27 patients with locally advanced breast cancer were irradiated with photons (60 Gy, 30 fractions; 8 MV, (60)Co) or neutrons (18 Gy, twelve fractions; 66 MeV(p-->Be)). The mean tumor diameters were 699 +/- 399 ml for the photon group and 1,097 +/- 831 ml in the neutron group. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 21.5 months tumor involution was evaluated in 22 patients. Partial and complete remissions were registered in 6/10 patients of the photon group and 5/12 patients of the neutron group. Late grade 3-4 morbidity according to RTOG definition was scored in 5/10 patients in the photon group and in 6/12 patients in the neutron group. With regard to tumor control and late radiation morbidity no differences between the two treatment arms were observed. CONCLUSION: The underlying data indicate that no benefit is to be expected from neutron therapy in breast cancer

1	2104	Dose calculation models for proton treatment planning using a dynamic beam delivery system: an attempt to include density heterogeneity effects in the analytical dose calculation	Algorithms, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Switzerland, Time	The gantry for proton radiotherapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is designed specifically for the spot-scanning technique. Use of this technique to its full potential requires dose calculation algorithms which are capable of precisely simulating each scanned beam individually. Different specialized analytical dose calculations have been developed, which attempt to model the effects of density heterogeneities in the patient's body on the dose. Their accuracy has been evaluated by a comparison with Monte Carlo calculated dose distributions in the case of a simple geometrical density interface parallel to the beam and typical anatomical situations. A specialized ray casting model which takes range dilution effects (broadening of the spectrum of proton ranges) into account has been found to produce results of good accuracy. This algorithm can easily be implemented in the iterative optimization procedure used for the calculation of the optimal contribution of each individual scanned pencil beam. In most cases an elemental pencil beam dose calculation has been found to be most accurate. Due to the long computing time, this model is currently used only after the optimization procedure as an alternative method of calculating the dose

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed gate pulse controller that starts and stops irradiation at a chosen phase of the respiratory cycle by controlling a linear accelerator was used in six patients with lung cancer. A laser displacement sensor was used for the detection of respiratory motion. Three patients underwent radiation therapy during the cycles between 50% expiration and 50% inspiration (step 1), and three patients underwent radiation therapy during the cycles between 70% expiration and 30% inspiration (step 2). RESULTS: The system functioned well; irradiation was verified with portal verification radiography in all six patients. The range of the tumor position during synchronized irradiation was detectable with fast portal localization radiography. The treatment times for steps 1 and 2 were 1.38-1.71 and 2.03-2.18 times longer, respectively, than those for conventional irradiation. CONCLUSION: Synchronized irradiation with the authors' system allowed convenient and reliable reduction of the target volume. Further study is needed to standardize the system for clinical use

Method. The technique was elaborated by O. Betti in the early 80. He used several coronal arcs to irradiate the center of the target with X rays circular minibeams. Their diameter (6 to 20 mm) is chosen according to the size of the nidus. The patient is seated in a specially built armchair. His head is immobilized with the Talairach frame afixed in the calvarium by 4 special screws: they allow to remove the frame after stereotactic angiography and/or CTscan and to replace it to perform the stereotactic irradiation. The frame and the head rotate around an horizontal axis passing by the linac isocenter ie the center of the target volume. The combination of both movements: rotation of the Linac and rotation of the stereotactic frame covers a spherical sector representing the surface of portals of entry of the minibeams. The frame can slide on a plate allowing access to the entire brain. Results.The special seat and the frame are movable on curved rails allowing to avoid or reduce irradiation of the body of the patient.

Results.The special seat and the frame are movable on curved rails allowing to avoid or reduce irradiation of the body of the patient. CONCLUSION: We have been using this system of irradiation in the seated position since 1986 to treat more than 900 patients

This retrospective study compares the results of treatment using hemibody irradiation (HBI) at the Royal Marsden Hospital (27 cases) with isotope therapy using the bone-seeking isotope strontium-89 (89Sr) at Southampton General Hospital (51 cases). Prior to analysis patients were matched for potential prognostic factors (performance status, bone scan extent of disease, age, histology and duration of hormone response) to minimize the effect of treatment selection bias. Pain control assessed at 3 months was similar for HBI and matched 89Sr cases, with 63% and 52% respectively showing some benefit. Median survival was similar for these groups at 20 and 21 weeks respectively. The unmatched 89Sr group, which had more favourable prognostic factors, had a better outcome with 96% showing improvement in pain and with a median survival of 59 weeks. Subsequent univariate analysis demonstrated that performance status and extent of disease on bone scan were of overriding importance in determining outcome. Transfusion requirements were higher for the HBI group than for the matched 89Sr group (50% and 25% respectively) but other bone marrow toxicity was similar. Despite routine anti-emetic therapy 37% of patients treated with HBI had some nausea or vomiting. Although expensive, 89Sr appears as effective a treatment option as HBI. Response is most likely with either approach when patients have a good performance status and a limited extent of disease. [References: 32]

We measured chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes before, during, and after radiotherapy, using the techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chemically induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC). Twenty-two lung cancer patients treated at HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) entered the study and signed an informed consent. Frequencies of lymphocytes with chromosomal aberrations at the end of carbon-ion therapy varied among the patients. This frequency was significantly correlated to the radiation field size and weakly correlated to the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes during the treatment. As a result, we have found that chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients treated for lung cancer by carbon-ions were dependent on target volume, possibly reflecting the increased involvement of lymph nodes in the target field

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

PATIENTS: and method. From January 1984 to December 1998, 705 patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, radiophysicians and radiotherapists. Age of revelation of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations ranged between birth to 73 years (mean 27, median 25). Age at time of radiosurgery ranged between 7 and 75 years (mean 33, median 31). There were 410 males for 295 females (sex- ratio 1.4). Symptoms of revelation were hemorrhage for 59%, seizures for 23%, headaches for 14% and progressive deficits for 4%. Discovery of cerebral arteriovenous malformation was fortuitous in 4% of cases. Repartition following Spetzler's grading was 12% in grade I, 36% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 12% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. Maximal size ranged between 4 and 60 mm (mean 23, median 20). Volume ranged between 0.2 and 24.3 cc (mean 3.8, median 2.8). Majority of cerebral arteriovenous malformations were large size (42% with size higher than 25 mm) and large volume (54% higher than 10 cc. 54% of patients had treatment prior radiosurgery: 38% had embolization, 10% were operated, 4% were treated by radiosurgery (reirradiation) and 3% were operated and embolized. RESULTS: Overall complete obliteration rate was 55%. The obliteration rate was correlated with size (77% for cAVMs lower than 15 mm, 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations between 15 and 25 mm, and 44% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 25 mm), with volume (94% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations lower than 1 cc, 64% between 1 and 4 cc, 48% between 4 and 10 cc, and 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 10 cc), dose at reference isodose, minimal dose, morphological parameters (presence of dural components, arteriolovenous fistula, plexiform angioarchitecture, arterial steal, arterial recruitment, deep exclusive drainage, venous plicature, venous confluence, venous ectasia, venous reflux), sectional topography and good recovery of the target. Embolization was a confusion factor not associated with obliteration rate. After multivariate analysis, only Dmin and complete coverage of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations were correlated with obliteration rate. Delay of obliteration was significantly correlated after multivariate analysis with Dmin, complete coverage, arteriolovenulary angioarchitecture (positive correlation) and venous ectasia (negative correlation). CONCLUSION: Overall complete obliteration rate is unreliable data to assess efficacy of radiosurgical method in the tretment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The obliteration rate must be interpretated after stratification on several morphological and dosimetric parameters

After multivariate analysis, only Dmin and complete coverage of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations were correlated with obliteration rate. Delay of obliteration was significantly correlated after multivariate analysis with Dmin, complete coverage, arteriolovenulary angioarchitecture (positive correlation) and venous ectasia (negative correlation). CONCLUSION: Overall complete obliteration rate is unreliable data to assess efficacy of radiosurgical method in the tretment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The obliteration rate must be interpretated after stratification on several morphological and dosimetric parameters

PATIENTS: and method. From January 1984 to December 1998, 705 patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, radiophysicians and radiotherapists. Age of revelation of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations ranged between birth to 73 years (mean 27, median 25). Age at time of radiosurgery ranged between 7 and 75 years (mean 33, median 31). There were 410 males for 295 females (sex- ratio 1.4). Symptoms of revelation were hemorrhage for 59%, seizures for 23%, headaches for 14% and progressive deficits for 4%. Discovery of cerebral arteriovenous malformation was fortuitous in 4% of cases. Repartition following Spetzler's grading was 12% in grade I, 36% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 12% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. Maximal size ranged between 4 and 60 mm (mean 23, median 20). Volume ranged between 0.2 and 24.3 cc (mean 3.8, median 2.8). Majority of cerebral arteriovenous malformations were large size (42% with size higher than 25 mm) and large volume (54% higher than 10 cc. 54% of patients had treatment prior radiosurgery: 38% had embolization, 10% were operated, 4% were treated by radiosurgery (reirradiation) and 3% were operated and embolized. RESULTS: Overall complete obliteration rate was 55%. The obliteration rate was correlated with size (77% for cAVMs lower than 15 mm, 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations between 15 and 25 mm, and 44% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 25 mm), with volume (94% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations lower than 1 cc, 64% between 1 and 4 cc, 48% between 4 and 10 cc, and 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 10 cc), dose at reference isodose, minimal dose, morphological parameters (presence of dural components, arteriolovenous fistula, plexiform angioarchitecture, arterial steal, arterial recruitment, deep exclusive drainage, venous plicature, venous confluence, venous ectasia, venous reflux), sectional topography and good recovery of the target.

Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been recognized as a clinicopathologic entity distinct from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapy, and prognosis of ESCC. METHODS: The medical records, from Jan. 1985 to Dec. 2005, of 53 patients with pathologically proved ESCC were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 39 were men and 14 were women, with the median age of 53 years (range, 27-76 years). Of the 53 cases of ESCC, 33 (62.3%) were detected in the esophagus, 5 in the cervix, 4 in the larynx, 3 in the pharynx, 2 in the upper sinus, 2 in the rectum and sublingual gland, 1 in the thyroid gland, 1 in the pleura, and 1 in the liver. Forty patients (75.5%) had limited disease (LD) and 13 (24.5%) had extensive disease (ED). Patients with ED mostly received platinum-based chemotherapy, for which the response rate was 69.2%. Patients with LD were treated with a variety of therapeutic modalities: 7 were treated with surgery plus radiochemotherapy, 3 with surgery plus radiotherapy, 18 with surgery plus chemotherapy, 6 with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, 4 with radiotherapy alone, and 2 with chemotherapy alone. The median survival time (MST) was 20 months for all patients, and the 1-and 3-year survival rates were 41.3% and 31.4%. MST for patients with ED and LD were 15 months and 26 months, respectively, and 1-and 3-year survival rates were 51.1% vs. 14.4%, and 42.5% vs. 0% (P=0.017 ). CONCLUSIONS: ESCC is identified in various sites, with the most common primary site being the esophagus. Multimodality therapy has become increasingly used for the majority of patients with LD-ESCC. Combination chemotherapy has been a major treatment for patients with ED-ESCC. Generally, the prognosis of LD-ESCC is significantly superior to ED-ESCC

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability

To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes

0	2193	Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with linear accelerator for uveal melanoma--preliminary Vienna results	Austria, Ciliary Body, Dose Fractionation, Eye, Fixation,Ocular, Follow-Up Studies, France, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Melanoma, Melanoma/pp [Physiopathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Safety, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Video Recording	PURPOSE: To study local tumor control and radiogenic side-effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and February 1998, 21 patients suffering from uveal melanomas have been treated with stereotactic 6 MeV LINAC (Saturne 43, General Electric, France) in conjunction with a stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB, Germany). Immobilization of the eye was ensured with an optical fixation system which was proven reliable. During radiotherapy, movements of the irradiated eye were controlled on a monitor and documented by video recording. All patients co-operated very well with the optical fixation system. In 1164 measurements, the median value of horizontal deviation of the diseased eye during treatment was 0.3 mm (range: 0 to 1.3 mm). Median vertical deviation was 0.2 mm (range: 0 to 1.2 mm). For all patients, mean tumor prominence before treatment was 6.0 +/- 2.2 mm. In 20 patients, the total dose of 70 Gy (at 80%) was delivered in 5 fractions within 10 days. In one patient with a ciliary body tumor, the total dose of 70 Gy was divided into 7 fractions for better sparing of the anterior eye segment. RESULTS: After a follow-up of at least 6 months, local tumor control was seen in all eyes. Mean tumor thickness reduction after 3, 6 and 9 months was 7%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Up to now, only mild subacute side-effects located in the anterior eye segment have been noticed. CONCLUSION: Optical fixation of the eye allows high precision stereotactic radiotherapy with small safety margins. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and 70 Gy total dose delivered in 5 fractions seems to be appropriate for local tumor control in uveal melanoma. Further long-term studies with extended number of patients will be necessary to conclude on the use of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma

Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University, for a ten-year period from 1976-1986. The overall incidence was 1.3% of all gynecologic malignancies. Twenty-four patients (83%) had squamous cell carcinoma and five (17%) had adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly located in the upper anterior and lateral vaginal vaults, whereas adenocarcinoma was found more often in the lower anterior and lateral vaginal vaults. The majority of the patients (96%) were managed by a combination of whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients had a recurrence in the vagina only, indicating the need for better local control. The overall survival rate was 48%. Patients with previous hysterectomy were more likely to develop serious treatment-related complications

Twenty-four patients (83%) had squamous cell carcinoma and five (17%) had adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly located in the upper anterior and lateral vaginal vaults, whereas adenocarcinoma was found more often in the lower anterior and lateral vaginal vaults. The majority of the patients (96%) were managed by a combination of whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients had a recurrence in the vagina only, indicating the need for better local control. The overall survival rate was 48%. Patients with previous hysterectomy were more likely to develop serious treatment-related complications

In spite of the impressive accomplishment in generating an adequate therapy beam, time was also found for careful radiobiological studies of neutron beams. However, it was not considered that for a certain early reaction the late effects were much greater with neutrons than with x-rays. The severe late sequelae in proportion to the few good results motivated the closure of this therapy. Neutron therapy was again introduced in Hammersmith hospital at the end of the 1960's. The major reason seems to have been to overcome the oxygen effect. Encouraging results were reported. It was argued that the very favourable statistics on local tumour control were obtained at the expense of more frequent and more severe complications. A clinical trial in Edinburgh seemed to indicate this, but it was not proved in the end as the two trials differed regarding fractionation. Today about 16,000 patients have been treated with neutrons. The neutron beams now used differ significantly, both regarding dose distributions and microdosimetrical properties, from those utilized earlier. The advantage of neutrons is still, however, controversial. There are indications that neutron treatment may be favourable for some tumours. A careful cost-benefit study ought to be performed before the creation of a neutron therapy centre in Sweden as the group of patients suitable for neutrons is limited, and there may be new possibilities for improvement of photon and electron treatment with much smaller resources

The first patient was treated in 1953 and the last in 1969. During this period the machine was used for research during the evenings and latterly it was available for research all day long. It was switched off for the last time in February 1984. In addition to the X-ray beam, electrons were used for treatment and for research, where the high dose rate and large field size were particularly useful. An account is given of some of the highlights of the clinical and research programmes

DESIGN: A retrospective, nonrandomized comparative study. METHODS: Charts of patients treated with 125I, 106Ru, and PBRT for choroidal melanoma between January 1988 and June 1996 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospitals were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Local control of choroidal melanomas after 125I, 106Ru, or PBRT. RESULTS: A total of 597 patients were identified (125I = 190, 106Ru = 140, PBRT = 267). Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did patients treated with either 125I (P = 0.0133; confidence interval [CI], 1.26-7.02; risk ratio, 2.97) or PBRT (P = 0.0097; CI, 1.30-6.66; risk ratio, 2.94). A stepwise Cox proportional hazard model found maximal basal diameter to be a significant covariate (P = 0.0033). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did those patients treated with either 125I or PBRT

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of sequential CT images at every 0.2 s was reconstructed from continuous X-ray projection data accumulated by dynamic helical scanning. At the same time that CT data was acquired, the respiratory signal of the patient and the X-ray on/off signal on CT scanner were recorded. Each CT image was timed according to the phase of respiration waveform. Conversion of the CT number to the water equivalent path length (WEL) was performed with our treatment planning system that included a conversion table. As an illustration, the CT images of a patient with liver cancer at the right upper lobe were analyzed. The geometric size of the liver and WELs from body surface to isocenter were measured in each CT image. RESULTS: Variations of WEL from body surface to isocenter at the anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior direction were 6.2 mm and 18.9 mm, respectively. Liver size changed by 35.2 mm. However, these variations were shown to be considerably reduced by gated irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: A method using sequential CT images with respiration waveform was proposed. It appeared to be useful in evaluating the uncertainties of the range calculation associated with patient breathing
