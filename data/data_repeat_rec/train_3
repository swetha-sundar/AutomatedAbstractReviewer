The authors followed 946 patients with melanomas of the choroid and/or ciliary body who had been treated with proton beam irradiation and who had provided a smoking history during their evaluation before treatment. After a mean follow-up of 33 months, 98 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease. Metastasis-free survival rates 3 years after irradiation were similar in association with never, past, and current cigarette smoking (86%, 89%, and 90%, respectively; P = 0.90). Rates also were similar with increasing pack-years of exposure and when the product smoked was cigarettes versus pipes or cigars only. Estimates for smoking effects were unchanged after adjusting for established prognostic factors for metastases. Results suggest that smoking does not alter the risk of metastases during the first few years after irradiation of choroidal melanomas

The technique used to achieve these results was simplified through the physical characteristics of the radioelement and the optimized-dosimetry program employed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 78 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine 125. About 100 Gy were delivered to the superior pole of the tumour. The minimal length of follow-up was 17 months and the average, 67 months. RESULTS: There was 88% local control, leading to lowered visual acuity in 76% of the cases. Radiation retinopathy, directly related to proximity to the macula, is the principle etiology. Seven patients died of hepatic metastasis, five patients were enucleated. Four patients were further treated with protontherapy to make up for noncontrol locally. CONCLUSION: One dose of 100 Gy to the superior pole of the tumor seemed to lead to good local control, with the exception of complications related to proximity to the macula and the optic nerve. In this attempt to optimize irradiation, the time lapse between any benefit in local control derived from irradiation and posttherapeutic complications observed remains insufficient to evaluate any relationship

The most common presenting symptoms were headache and diplopia, and the most common presenting sign was extraocular palsy. Fifty-three operations directed at removal of the tumor were performed. Twenty-three patients received various forms of radiation therapy postoperatively, including conventional external beam therapy, heavy charged particles, and interstitial implants. The average length of follow-up is 5.6 years. Eleven of 26 patients have died; the mean duration of survival in this group, excluding 1 perioperative death, was 4 years and 2 months. Although the average survival time of 6 years and 4 months was the same in patients with typical chordomas (excluding the perioperative death and 1 patient lost to follow-up) and in those with the chondroid variant, all of the latter are still alive, whereas more than half of the patients with typical chordoma have died

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 16 primary and 11 recurrent sacral chordoma patients treated from November 1982 to November 2002 by proton/photon radiation therapy alone (6 patients) or combined with surgery (21 patients) have been analyzed for local control, survival, and treatment-related morbidity. The outcome analysis is based on follow-up information as of 2005. RESULTS: Outcome results show a large difference in local failure rate between patients treated for primary and recurrent chordomas. Local control results by surgery and radiation were 12/14 vs. 1/7 for primary and recurrent lesions. For margin-positive patients, local control results were 10 of 11 and 0 of 5 in the primary and recurrent groups, respectively; the mean follow-up on these locally controlled patients was 8.8 years (4 at 10.3, 12.8, 17, and 21 years). Radiation alone was used in 6 patients, 4 of whom received > or =73.0 Gy (E); local control was observed in 3 of these 4 patients for 2.9, 4.9, and 7.6 years. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a high local control rate for surgical and radiation treatment of primary (12 of 14) as distinct from recurrent (1 of 7) sacral chordomas. Three of 4 chordomas treated by > or =73.0 Gy (E) of radiation alone had local control; 1 is at 91 months. This indicates that high-dose proton/photon therapy offers an effective treatment option

Two different chemotherapy regimens were used for concurrent chemoradiation. In the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was infused intravenously, followed immediately by five consecutive daily administrations of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2/day, each infused intravenously over 24 hr. As for the patients with adenocarcinoma, 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 250 mg/m2 of cytoxan and 45 mg/m2 of adriamycin were administered intravenously on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 54.4% with stage III and IV, 62.6% with lymph node metastasis on computed tomogram or MRI, 77.9% with stage I-II disease with lesion size > or =4 cm, and 50.3% with small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Side effects from concurrent chemoradiation such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were present in all 395 cases. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were observed to varying degrees, but there was no toxic death. This study suggests that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation in treating cervical cancer patients with high risk factors is effective and relatively well tolerated, with acceptable toxicity

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of higher dose by rotational multileaf collimator (MLC) conformal radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1984 to 1995, 38 consecutive cases with intracranial glioblastoma multiforme were treated using the rotational MLC conformal therapy. There were 25 men and 13 women with a median age of 47 years (12-73 years, mean 46.5 years). Median Karnofsky performance score was 80 (30-100, mean 78.2). Median tumor volume was 64 cc (8-800 cc, mean 110.3 cc). All underwent surgical intervention (only biopsy in 1, partial resection in 13, subtotal resection in 21, and gross total resection in 3). Radiation dose to was 60 to 80 Gy (median 68.5 Gy, mean 68.3 Gy) in 21 patients treated before 1990 and 90 Gy in the 17 patients thereafter. Biweekly i.v. chemotherapy was also administered for both arms. RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival rates were 75%, 42%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed the initial tumor volume, residual tumor volume, and Karnofsky performance score were statistically significant factors for survival. Only the residual tumor volume was statistically significant by multivariate analysis. The 5-year survival rate of patients with residual tumors of 5 cc or less in volume was as good as 37%. Survival of the 90-Gy Group appeared inferior to that of the Low-Dose Group, though no statistical difference was seen (the 3-year survival was 40% vs. 22%). Local failure was observed in 16 of the 19 recurrences in the Low-Dose Group, whereas it was observed in only 4 of the 13 recurrences in the 90-Gy Group. The difference in pattern of failure was statistically significant. Two patients of the High-Dose Group developed radiation necrosis and one died of it. CONCLUSIONS: The high-dose conformal radiotherapy did not improve survival in the disease, but did change the pattern of failure

Patient treatments within the pilot project are carried out by radiation oncologists of the University of Heidelberg in cooperation with the Department of Biophysics of GSI, the Division of Medical Physics of the German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg and the Research Center Rossendorf. Patients are treated within three beam time blocks of 20 days per year at the basic physics research center at GSI, the overall capacity per year being 45 to 50 patients. Main purpose of the pilot project was to investigate carbon ion radiation therapy for different tumor entities within clinical phase I/II trials. This manuscript updates the results of the clinical phase I/II trial of carbon ion RT in chordomas and low grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base and summarizes the current status of the ongoing phase I/II trial for extracranial chordomas and low grade chondrosarcomas

[Review] [18 refs]	Enchondromatosis, Enchondromatosis/di [Diagnosis], Fingers/ra [Radiography], Humans, Humerus/ra [Radiography], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Risk, Scapula/ra [Radiography], Skull/pa [Pathology], Syndrome	Maffucci's syndrome is a rare congenital non-inherited condition, characterized by multiple enchondromata, cutaneous haemangiomata and more recently spindle-cell haemangioma-endotheliomata. It is associated with an increased risk of malignancy including intracranial chondrosarcomas. Early diagnosis is crucial; screening patients with Ollier's disease is recommended. The treatment of choice for these intracranial cartilaginous tumours is complete surgical excision but this is often difficult to achieve due to difficult access and relationships with neurovascular structures. An alternative treatment is proton-beam therapy. We report a case of Maffucci's syndrome; illustrating the typical clinical and radiological features as well as the known complications of the condition. [References: 18]

There were 18 females and 15 males with a median age of 26 years (range: 9-69) and a median follow-up time of 16 months (range: 7-32). The arteriovenous malformation volumes treated ranged from 0.2 to 42 cm3. The prescribed doses at the isocenter varied from 50 to 55 Gy and were given as a single fraction in the majority of the patients (31/33). Late complications consisting of intracranial bleeding and/or hemiparesis were observed in three patients. To date, 21 patients underwent repeat angiographic studies at 1 year post-treatment. A complete obliteration of the lesion was achieved in 38% of these patients. For the patients whose arteriovenous malformation nidus was covered by a minimum dose of 25 Gy, the total obliteration rate was 61.5% (8/13), whereas none of the patients who had received less than 25 Gy at the edge of the nidus obtained a total obliteration. Our preliminary analysis at 1 year post-radiosurgery reveals results comparable to those previously reported for other radiosurgical techniques for the same follow-up period

Dosimetric factors are used for prediction of the occurrence of RP after XRT. Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CRT) is a promising modality because of its excellent dose localization and high biological effect on tumors. This study aims to analyze the relationship between dosimetric factors developed for XRT and the incidence of RP in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after CRT. We examined 80 inoperable patients with NSCLC. The ranges of the daily fraction sizes and the total doses were from 3.3 to 8.8 GyE and from 59.4 to 95.4 GyE, respectively. These doses were successfully delivered with acceptable toxicity; >or= grade 2 RP was observed in 8 patients (10%). The severity of RP was graded within 6 months of the initiation of CRT using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. These results indicate the excellent dose distribution of CRT. We then compared the dosimetric data of the 8 patients developed >or= grade 2 RP with those of 72 patients developed <or= grade 1 RP. Dosimetric factors useful for predicting RP in XRT, such as the percentage of the computed tomography-defined total lung volume receiving > 5, > 20, and > 30 GyE, and mean lung dose, were not predictive factors for RP after CRT. The dosimetric factors used for XRT are not applicable for CRT in patients with NSCLC. The dosimetric factors for CRT remain to be developed

Actuarial 5 (and 8) year survival rates for clinical Stage A (N = 25), B (N = 85), and C (N = 88) disease were 96% (82), 77% (63), and 61% (38). The corresponding 5 (and 8) year relapse-free survivals were 84% (67), 68% (61), and 53% (36). Actuarial rates of clinical local failure at 5 (and 8) years were 0%, (0), 12% (20), and 15% (30) for Stage A, B, and C respectively. There was a suggestion of a decrease in the force of local and overall recurrence after 8 years, although further follow-up will be necessary for confirmation. Among 42 patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by irradiation, lymph node status appeared to be a strong predictor of distant failure (9% (3/32) failures for node (-) patients compared to 70% (7/10) for node (+) patients). Twenty-nine patients received radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for clinically palpable (Stage B and C) tumor. Only one of 16 patients treated post-operatively because of microscopic or gross residual disease has developed recurrence. By contrast, only 2 of 13 patients irradiated because of clinical local tumor recurrence remain alive and free of disease. We conclude that radiation therapy can provide effective long-term local control of prostate carcinoma, but that the ultimate radiocurability of the disease is not yet known

RT was given to a total dose of 60 Gy in six weeks, for CRT additional simultaneous 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12) and mitomycin C (5 mg/m2 days 5 and 12) was administered. 67% respectively 82% of the patients had UICC stage II to IIIB disease predominantly with G2 and G3 squamous cell carcinomas. Local control after three years was 79% for the RT group vs. 82% for the CRT group. Three-year survival rate was 68% and 71%, respectively. These differences were not significant. Only for G1- compared to G3-tumors there is a significantly higher survival rate. Acute and late damage was slightly lower for the RT treatment group (77% and 25%) compared to the CRT group (79% and 30%). In both treatment groups there was one patient needing a permanent colostomy due to radiation induced proctitis. In conclusion, RT or CRT should be the primary form of treatment in patients with and canal carcinoma and abdominoperineal resection should only be performed in case of local recurrence or tumor persistence. The final decision about the indications for RT or CRT can only be made with the results of a prospective randomized trial

RT was given to a total dose of 60 Gy in six weeks, for CRT additional simultaneous 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12) and mitomycin C (5 mg/m2 days 5 and 12) was administered. 67% respectively 82% of the patients had UICC stage II to IIIB disease predominantly with G2 and G3 squamous cell carcinomas. Local control after three years was 79% for the RT group vs. 82% for the CRT group. Three-year survival rate was 68% and 71%, respectively. These differences were not significant. Only for G1- compared to G3-tumors there is a significantly higher survival rate. Acute and late damage was slightly lower for the RT treatment group (77% and 25%) compared to the CRT group (79% and 30%). In both treatment groups there was one patient needing a permanent colostomy due to radiation induced proctitis. In conclusion, RT or CRT should be the primary form of treatment in patients with and canal carcinoma and abdominoperineal resection should only be performed in case of local recurrence or tumor persistence.

After a mean follow-up period of 15.6 months 3 eyes had to be enucleated. In two eyes fresh tumors developed, which were successfully treated with local beta-radiation. In the remaining 22 eyes the tumor growth was stopped or the tumor regressed. External beam therapy for choroidal melanomas seems to be an effective alternative to enucleation in eyes with tumors not accessible for other methods of treatment and which cannot be enucleated, e.g., single eyes

In operable rectal cancer intensive irradiation at a single focal dose of 6.5 Gy and summary dose of 19.5 Gy (3 daily fractions), in operable colonic cancer 4 and 20 Gy (5 daily fractions respectively). The five-year survival rate attained during combined treatment of rectal cancer exceeded that after radical operations by 30%. Fractional-extended irradiation at a single focal dose of 4 Gy and summary dose of 40 Gy (every other day) in 44.6% of the patients permitted one to make locally disseminated rectal cancer resectable. Preoperative irradiation of locally disseminated rectal cancer with a preliminary synchronization of the tumor cell division cycle with 5-fluorouracil (a single focal dose of 6 Gy, summary dose of 36 Gy for irradiation twice a week) was well tolerated by the patients, and its effect on tumors was more noticeable as compared to radiotherapy only. Marked radiation reactions were absent in colonic cancer, radical operation (hemicolectomy) entailed no additional difficulties. Local recurrences were not noted in either of 10 patients who had been followed-up in the course of 1 year

1	1769	A comparison of dose distributions of proton and photon beams in stereotactic conformal radiotherapy of brain lesions	Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: Micromultileaf collimators (mMLC) have recently been introduced to conform photon beams in stereotactic irradiation of brain lesions. Proton beams and stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) can be used to tailor the dose to nonspherical targets, as most tumors of the brain are irregularly shaped. Comparative planning of brain lesions using either proton or stereotactically guided photon beams was done to assess the institution's clinically available modality for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For the photon treatment, multiple stereotactically guided uniform intensity beams from a linear accelerator were used, each conformed to a projection of the planning target volume (PTV) by a mMLC. Proton beams were delivered from an isocentrically mounted gantry, using the spot-scanning technique and energy modulation. Seven patients were scanned in a stereotactic frame; target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) were delineated with the help of MR images. Four different lesions were selected: (1) concave, (2) ellipsoid isolated, (3) superficial and close to an organ at risk, and (4) irregular complex. Dose distributions in the PTV and critical structures were calculated using three-dimensional treatment-planning systems, followed by both a quantitative (by dose--volume histogram and conformity index) and qualitative (visual inspection) assessment of the plans. RESULTS: A high degree of conformation was achieved with a mMLC and stereotactic uniform intensity beams with comparable conformity indices to protons for 5 out of 7 plans, especially for superficial or spherical lesions. In the cases studied, the conformity index was better for protons than for photons for complex or concave lesions, or when the PTV was in the neighborhood of critical structures. CONCLUSION: The results for the cases studied, show that for simple geometries or for superficial lesions, there is no advantage in using protons. However, for complex PTV shapes, or when the PTV is in the vicinity of critical structures, protons seem to be potentially better than the fixed-field photon technique

Comparison is made with 79 patients treated by subtotal surgery alone from 1962-1980. Progression-free survival for 17 patients irradiated after initial incomplete surgery was 88% at 8 years compared with 48% for similar patients treated by surgery alone (p = 0.057). 16 patients incompletely resected at time of first recurrence were irradiated and 78% were progression-free at 8 years while 11% of a similar group treated by surgery alone were progression free (p = 0.001). Long term overall survival was high and similar in both control and study groups. Two patients were irradiated at second recurrence and 1 patient at third recurrence. Twenty-five patients were treated with photons alone and have a median follow-up of 57 months, 6 patients have recurred at doses 45-60 Gy. Eleven patients were treated with combined 10 MV photons and 160 MV protons utilizing 3-D treatment planning. These patients have been followed for a median of 53 months and none have failed to date. Eight of 11 received 54-60.4 Gy and 3/11 greater than 64.48 Gy. Sex, age, pathology grade and score, surgery and timing of radiation therapy were not associated with significant differences in failure patterns within the irradiated study group (p less than 0.1).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable

The patient is irradiated with equal doses from the right and the left side. So a dose of 10 Gy in the middle of the body is achieved which is determined individually by means of phantom measurements. In order to avoid the risk of an interstitial pneumonitis, the lung region is temporarily blinded in such a way that a dose of 8 Gy is obtained there in the middle of the body. During the irradiations, the accumulated dose is measured in different body regions with thermoluminescence dosimeters, a semi-conductor diode and, eventually, a ionization chamber. The scattering width is +/- 13%. We do our best to make the patient's position as comfortable as possible

Three fractions of 1.80 Gy, 4 h apart, were given on three treatment days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and the tumour dose was taken to 59.40 Gy in 33 fractions in 24-25 days. Acute mucosal reactions were generally quite severe, but a split was avoided by providing the patient with intensive support, often as an in-patient, until the reactions settled. Late radiation effects have been comparable to those obtained with conventional fractionation. The probability of local-regional control was 47% at 3 years for 69 previously untreated patients, whereas it was only 12% at one year for 20 patients treated for recurrence after radical surgery. Fifty-eight previously untreated patients with tumours arising in the upper aero-digestive tract were analysed in greater detail. The probability of local-regional control at 3 years was 78% for 17 Stage III patients and 15% for 31 Stage IV patients. This schedule of continuous AFRT is feasible and merits further investigation

Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only.

The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

All patients had locally advanced disease without evidence of distant metastases. Partial compensation for tissue inhomogeneities was accomplished. Although palliation of symptoms and regression of tumor was commonly seen, local failure occurred in most patients (77%). The median survival was 8 months. It does not appear that an increase in tumor dose relative to normal tissues can be achieved that would be high enough to increase locoregional control rates over historical control rates with low-LET irradiation. Further studies will be carried out with heavier particles such as neon or silicon in hopes of achieving greater biological effect on these difficult-to-control tumors

A total of 184 patients were treated. The authors have been of opinion that therapeutic methods depended on function of the neuroendocrine system and adrenal cortex, e. g. reserpine used after gamma-therapy alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy increased the efficacy of therapy and reduced the time of remission. Parlodel used alone or in combination with chloditan could be used in therapy of early forms of the disease in young patients. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy and proton beam therapy of the hypophysis were recommended in hypophysial adenomas. Proton beam therapy of the hypophysis was an effective method for therapy of patients with diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and could be used in diffuse nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy

Diode and thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD) measurements were carried out for the linear accelerators of 6 MV photon beams. ESTRO in vivo dosimetry protocols were followed in the determination of midline doses from measurements of entrance and exit doses. Of the fields monitored by diodes, the maximum absolute deviation of measured midline doses from planned target doses was 8%, with the mean value and the standard deviation of -1.0 and 2.7%. If planned target doses were calculated using radiological water equivalent thicknesses rather than patient geometric thicknesses, the maximum absolute deviation dropped to 4%, with the mean and the standard deviation of 0.7 and 1.8%. For in vivo dosimetry monitored by TLDs, the shift in mean dose remained small but the statistical precision became poor

The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates for all patients were 68% and 44%, respectively. The median time to recurrence was 19 months. Extent of surgery, age, and radiation dose to the posterior fossa all were of prognostic value. Complete or subtotal gross resection appeared to be a favorable prognostic indicator compared with biopsy only (P less than 0.05), with a 69% versus 40% actuarial survival rate at 5 years, respectively. Infants 2 years of age or less had a diminished 5-year actuarial survival rate of 48% (P less than 0.05) compared with older age groups. The posterior fossa was the predominant site of recurrence and accounted for 78% of all failures. Local control in the posterior fossa was dose dependent. Seventy-nine percent of the tumors that received 5000 cGy or greater were controlled versus only 33% of the tumors that received less than 5000 cGy (P less than 0.02). There were no supratentorial failures, and there was only one isolated spinal cord failure. There were no solitary spinal failures in 24 patients who received a median dose of only 2400 cGy to the spinal axis. We concluded that low-dose irradiation to the spine and whole brain may be indicated with maintenance of a posterior fossa dose of greater than 5000 cGy

1	340	The impact of dose escalation on secondary cancer risk after radiotherapy of prostate cancer	Computer Simulation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Models,Biological, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Photons, Physics, Probability, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostatic Neoplasms/co [Complications], Prostatic Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Risk, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To estimate secondary cancer risk due to dose escalation in patients treated for prostatic carcinoma with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and spot-scanned proton RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential, a plateau, and a linear dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 23 patients who received RT of prostate cancer. Conformal RT was used in 7 patients, 8 patients received IMRT with 6- and 15-MV photons, and 8 patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. We applied target doses ranging from 70 Gy to 100 Gy. Cancer risk was estimated as a function of target dose and tumor control probability. RESULTS: At a 100-Gy target dose the secondary cancer risk relative to the 3D treatment plan at 70 Gy was +18.4% (15.0% for a plateau model, 22.3% for a linear model) for the 6-MV IMRT plan, +25.3% (17.0%, 14.1%) for the 15-MV IMRT plan, and -40.7% (-41.3%, -40.0%) for the spot-scanned protons. The increasing risk of developing a radiation-associated malignancy after RT with increasing dose was balanced by the enhanced cure rates at a larger dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk after dose escalation for prostate RT is expected to be equal to or lower than for conventional 3D treatment at 70 Gy, independent of treatment modality or dose-response model. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice for dose escalation because this therapy can halve the risk of secondary cancers

This evaluation was performed by measurement of dosimetric characteristics of the GRID radiation field in parallel opposed and single beam geometry. The limitations of the parallel opposed technique in terms of field size and tumor thickness have been evaluated for the conditions of acceptable spatial modulation. The results of this investigation have demonstrated an increase in therapeutic advantage for the parallel opposed technique over the single beam method when treating a deep seated tumor

Protons offer an opportunity to increase the radiation dose to the prostate while minimizing treatment toxicity. METHODS: Six hundred forty-three patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons, with or without photons. Treatments were planned with a 3D planning system; patients received 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE per fraction. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The overall clinical disease-free survival rate was 89% at 5 years. When post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as an endpoint for disease control, the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for patients with an initial PSA of < 4.0 ng/ml, and 89%, 72%, and 53% for patients with initial PSA levels of 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and > 20.0, respectively. Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91%, 79%, and 40%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels. A prospective randomized dose-escalation trial is now underway to help define the optimum dose of radiation for patients with early stage prostate cancer

Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91%, 79%, and 40%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels. A prospective randomized dose-escalation trial is now underway to help define the optimum dose of radiation for patients with early stage prostate cancer

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis

The German Group of Pediatric Radiation Oncology (APRO) has generated a concept for a prospective evaluation of radiation-associated late effects in childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a nationwide central database for the documentation of radiation parameters and side effects of all children treated within therapy protocols of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A study center has been implemented in Muenster, the documentation has started in July 2001 in few centers in a pilot phase. Since February 2004 the documentation is done countrywide. Detailed documentation forms have been designed for treatment parameters and for doses applied at organs at risk. Furthermore, a uniform toxicity documentation, according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria, was chosen. Patients were reported from the study centers of the GPOH to the study center. All information was collected and analyzed in the study center. RESULTS: Till July 31, 2005, 438 documentations of radiation and 579 toxicity documentations of side effects have been collected in the study center. 46 centers for radiotherapy in Germany and one center each in Austria and in Switzerland took part in the documentation. The quality of documentation regarding completeness and plausibility fulfilled the expected criteria in most cases. This feasibility analysis showed that important information about organ dose levels and side effects was documented in a large number of patients (Figures 1 and 2). CONCLUSION: This prospective evaluation of radiotherapy and radiogenic side effects in children and adolescents will allow correlating doses at organs at risk and the incidence of acute and late sequelae in Germany. Further documentations and a longer follow-up are necessary to obtain powerful results

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy

1	3195	[Present state and future of radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer]. [Review] [11 refs] [Japanese]	Adenocarcinoma, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Female, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Research, Stomach, Survival, Survival Rate, Time	According to a nation-wide annual report on pancreatic cancer patients in 1992, 70 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer underwent operations. Thirty percent of them, along with 10 percent of patients who did not undergo operations, underwent radiation therapy. The result of external radiation monotherapy for local advanced pancreatic cancer is so poor that the 2-year survival rate and the median survival time have been reported in some papers to be approximately 10% and at most 13 months, respectively. Our results indicated that the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates and the median survival time after external radiation monotherapy for local advanced pancreatic cancer were 21%, 11%, 5% and 11.3 months, respectively. The reasons for the poor results are thought to be as follows: pancreatic cancer is very malignant, invades the surrounding tissues and metastasizes distantly in its earliest stages; it is mostly adenocarcinoma resistant to radiation therapy; and the pancreas borders closely the stomach and duodenum, which are very sensitive to radiation. Therefore, charged particle radiotherapy, especially heavy ion radiotherapy, is expected to bring about advances in the field of radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer because of its excellent potential for dose distribution and biological effect.

In the present study, a further step was made, aiming at the improvement of the effectiveness of in vivo dosimetry, based on a real-time check of the dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Entrance dose was determined using micro-MOSFET detectors placed inside a thin, sterile, transparent catheter. The epoxy side of the detector was faced towards the beam to minimize the anisotropy. Each detector was plugged into a bias supply (standard sensitivity) and calibrated at 5 Gy using 6 MeV electrons produced by a conventional linac. Detectors were characterized in terms of linearity, precision and dose per pulse dependence. No energy and temperature dependence was found. The sensitivity change of detectors was about 1% per 20 Gy accumulated dose. Correction factors to convert surface to entrance dose were determined for each combination of energy and applicator. From November 2004 to May 2005, in vivo dosimetry was performed on 45 patients affected by early-stage breast cancer, who underwent IOERT to the tumour bed. IOERT was delivered using electrons (4-10 MeV) at high dose per pulse, produced by either a Novac7 or a Liac mobile linac. RESULTS: The mean ratio between measured and expected dose was 1.006+/-0.035 (1 SD), in the range 0.92-1.1. The procedure uncertainty was 3.6%. Micro-MOSFETs appeared suitable for in vivo dosimetry in IOERT, although some unfavourable aspects, like the limited lifetime and the anisotropy with no build-up, were found. Prospectively, a real-time action level (+/-6%) on dose discrepancy was defined. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent agreement between measured and expected doses was found. Real-time in vivo dosimetry appeared feasible, reliable and more effective than the method previously published

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. A total of 2645 patients (2648 eyes) with uveal melanoma were treated between 1984 and 1999 with proton beam radiotherapy. Data were analyzed as of February 2001. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 90 years, 1284 were men, and 1361 were women. Largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 27.5 mm, and tumor height from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization

Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The biologic effective dose concept is used to estimate the alpha/beta ratio and K (dose equivalent for tumor repopulation/d) for high-grade glioma patients treated in a randomized fractionation trial. The equivalent radiation dose of temozolomide (Temodar) chemotherapy was estimated from another randomized study. The method assumes that the radiotherapy biologic effective dose is proportional to the adjusted radiotherapy survival duration of high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS: The median tumor alpha/beta and K estimate is 9.32 Gy and 0.23 Gy/d, respectively. Using the published surviving fraction after 2-Gy exposure (SF2) data, and the above alpha/beta ratio, the estimated median alpha value was 0.077 Gy(-1), beta was 0.009 Gy(-2), and the cellular doubling time was 39.5 days. The median equivalent biologic effective dose of temozolomide was 11.03 Gy(9.3) (equivalent to a radiation dose of 9.1 Gy given in 2-Gy fractions). Random sampling trial simulations based on a cure threshold of 70 Gy in high-grade gliomas have shown the potential increase in tumor cure with dose escalation. Partial elimination of hypoxic cells (by chemical hypoxic cell sensitizers or carbon ion therapy) has suggested that considerable gains in tumor control, which are further supplemented by temozolomide, are achievable. CONCLUSION: The radiobiologic parameters for human high-grade gliomas can be estimated from clinical trials and could be used to inform future clinical trials, particularly combined modality treatments with newer forms of radiotherapy. Other incurable cancers should be studied using similar radiobiologic analysis

DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: All 1632 patients with choroidal melanoma treated at a single center between 1993 and 2002. INTERVENTION: Primary enucleation (35%), brachytherapy (31.3%), proton beam radiotherapy (16.7%), transscleral local resection (11.0%), endoresection (3.7%), transpupillary thermotherapy (2.5%), and photocoagulation (0.1%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary and secondary enucleation. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed the main predictive factors for primary enucleation to be: age more than 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-3.2%); reduced visual acuity (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.2%); posterior extension close to or involving the optic disc and fovea (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2%-2.4%); circumferential spread around the ciliary body, iris, or angle (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8%-5.5%); basal tumor diameter (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.4%-5.0%); and tumor height (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 4.5%-8.9%). After conservative treatment, the actuarial rate of secondary enucleation was 11.1% at 5 years (95% CI, 8.6%-13.6%). Cox multivariate analysis indicated the factors independently predicting secondary enucleation as: nasal/midline tumor location (risk ratio [RR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6%-4.4%); disc involvement (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2%-4.1%); tumor diameter (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.5%); and tumor thickness (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%).

Curative resectability was 70% (19/27) with 4 operative deaths (21%). Recurrence rate was 66% after a mean period of 16 months, and the failure pathway was nodal in 53% of the cases. Historical comparison of the data suggests that preoperative irradiation increases the curative resectability rate without changing the early recurrence rate or failure pathway. Tumors with deeper invasion of the esophageal wall, which benefit by preoperative irradiation, are probably related to greater nodal diffusion, which is partly outside of the volume that may be resected or irradiated

These measurements were carried out to monitor the long-term exposure of these potentially toxic trace elements through hand bone levels. The dose equivalent delivered to a patient during irradiation procedure is the limiting factor for IVNAA measurements. This article describes a method to estimate the average radiation dose equivalent delivered to the patient's hand during irradiation. The computational method described in this work augments the dose measurements carried out earlier [Arnold et al., 2002. Med. Phys. 29(11), 2718-2724]. This method employs the Monte Carlo simulation of hand irradiation facility using MCNP4B. Based on the estimated dose equivalents received by the patient hand, the proposed irradiation procedure for the IVNAA measurement of manganese in human hands [Arnold et al., 2002. Med. Phys. 29(11), 2718-2724] with normal (1 ppm) and elevated manganese content can be carried out with a reasonably low dose of 31 mSv to the hand. Sixty-three percent of the total dose equivalent is delivered by non-useful fast group (> 10 keV); the filtration of this neutron group from the beam will further decrease the dose equivalent to the patient's hand

Clinical and radiological (MRI) follow-up series suggest that having hemorrhaged once, recurrent hemorrhage with progressive neurologic dysfunction may commonly occur. We have therefore chosen to treat these lesions when first symptomatic with stereotactic linear radiosurgery (SLR). We now report, after a median follow-up of 27 months, 12 patients with CAs (9 women, 3 men, mean age 40 years) treated in this fashion. Ten patients presented with hemorrhage (3 had more than one hemorrhage): two patients had new onset seizures. All patients had enhanced MRI/MRAs characteristic of CA. There were five brainstem and five thalamic CAs, and one each in the temporal lobe and insula. Cerebral angiograms were done in 8 patients for comparison with their respective MRAs. Only one CA was visualized in the late venous phase on cerebral angiogram and identical vascular features were appreciated on the MRA. The diameter of the CAs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 cm with a mean of 1.6 cm. Dosimetry planning was based on MRI/CT features and the mean dose at the isocenter was 2.167 cGy (range = 2,000-2,500 cGy) delivered with a mean collimation diameter of 1.46 cm (range = 1.0-2.0 cm). All 12 patients continued to improve neurologically after SLR and had MRI-documented changes in their lesions: in general, the lesions became smaller and signal characteristics converted to methemaglobin. However, 1 patient had an early post-SLR hemorrhage, documented by MRI, at 4.5 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with skull base chordoma who were treated with proton beams with or without X-rays at the University of Tsukuba between 1989 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A median total tumor dose of 72.0 Gy (range, 63.0-95.0 Gy) was delivered. The patients were followed for a median period of 69.3 months (range, 14.6-123.4 months). RESULTS: The 5-year local control rate was 46.0%. Cause-specific, overall, and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 72.2%, 66.7%, and 42.2%, respectively. The local control rate was higher, without statistical significance, for those with preoperative tumors <30 mL. Partial or subtotal tumor removal did not yield better local control rates than for patients who underwent biopsy only as the latest surgery. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is effective for patients with skull base chordoma, especially for those with small tumors. For a patient with a tumor of <30 mL with no prior treatment, biopsy without tumor removal seems to be appropriate before proton beam therapy. [References: 38]

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period.

Oncologically the combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy offers an alternative treatment option. The functional results and the complication rate in stage III and IV tumors of the oral tongue, floor of mouth and oropharynx are described in a patients series. METHOD: The follow-up includes 17 consecutive patients who were primarily treated by a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy between 1997 and 2000. The oncological benefit (complete remission, disease-free survival), the functional results (mastication, swallowing, speech and pain) and the complications were reviewed. RESULTS: After the follow-up period 16/17 patients were alive. There were 3 major complications, one of them lethal. The functional results resembled those after surgical resections. CONCLUSIONS: A combined radiotherapy is a feasible method of treating patients who refrain from surgery. Moreover the application ranges from inoperability to postoperative radiotherapy in cases with close or positive margins. In connection with neck-dissections and therapy of recurrent cancer major complications may occur.

Currently, this information is scattered throughout each of the different treatment and information systems in the oncology department. Furthermore, the lack of organization with standardized methods makes it difficult and time-consuming to navigate through the maze of data, resulting in challenges during patient treatment planning. We present a methodology to develop this electronic patient record (ePR) system based on DICOM standards and perform knowledge-based medical imaging informatics research on specific clinical scenarios where patients are treated with PT. Treatment planning is similar in workflow to traditional radiation therapy (RT) methods such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which utilizes a priori knowledge to drive the treatment plan in an inverse manner. In March 2006, two new RT objects were drafted in a DICOM-RT Supplement 102 specifically for ion therapy, which includes PT. The standardization of DICOM-RT-ION objects and the development of a knowledge base as well as decision-support tools that can be add-on features to the ePR DICOM-RT system were researched. This methodology can be used to extend to PT and the development of future clinical decision-making scenarios during the course of the patient's treatment that utilize "inverse treatment planning." We present the initial steps of this imaging and informatics methodology for PT and lay the foundation for development of future decision-support tools tailored to cancer patients treated with PT. By integrating decision-support knowledge and tools designed to assist in the decision-making process, a new and improved "knowledge-enhanced treatment planning" approach can be realized	
1	4145	Biophysical investigations of the dose-effect relationship in chromosome aberrations of human lymphocytes caused by thorotrast deposits. II. Biological and medical aspects	Alpha Particles, Calibration, Chromosome Aberrations, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Gamma Rays, Humans, Kinetics, Lymph Nodes/me [Metabolism], Lymphocytes, Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Thorium, Thorium Dioxide, Thorium Dioxide/ae [Adverse Effects], Thorium Dioxide/me [Metabolism], Tissue Distribution	The biological effect of alpha-radiation, which has been examined in this investigation, is the occurrence of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of Thorotrast patients. To set up a dose-effect relationship, it is necessary to estimate the absorbed dose of a single lymphocyte found in a blood sample. Then it would be possible to use chromosome aberrations of lymphocytes from peripheral blood as an indicator for estimating the effective radiation dose. The physical aspects of this investigation have been described in part I of this paper. In part II, biomedical considerations are described and discussed. The irradiation of the lymphocytes takes place in the whole lymphatic system, but the lymph node could have been used as a model for the lymphatic system. Based on the evaluation of size and distribution of Thorotrast conglomerates, the average annual dose in different structures of the lymph node has been determined. The Thorotrast content in lymph nodes depends on the region of the body from where the lymph nodes originate. It has been tried to compile the distribution of the lymph nodes in the different regions of the body. Annual doses have been calculated in these different regions in order to find a representative value for the whole body. The values describing the kinetics of the lymphocytes in the body have been used to convert the annual dose in lymph nodes into the dose of a lymphocyte found in a sample of peripheral blood. It is pointed out that the calculated dose of the lymphocytes, being 250 rad, is an estimation of an upper value. The lymphocytes are "in vivo" irradiated by the Thorotrast, but most of the calibrations used for biological dosimetry are referred to as "in vitro" experiments. The discrepancy between "in vivo" and "in vitro" results are discussed in the findings of this study and in other results

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I/II dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy. Fifty-seven patients with 64 sites of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for resection received carbon ion radiotherapy. Tumors involved the spine or paraspinous soft tissues in 19 patients, pelvis in 32 patients, and extremities in six patients. The total dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 gray equivalent (GyE) and was administered in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks (3.3 to 4.6 GyE/fraction). The median tumor size was 559 cm(3) (range, 20 to 2,290 cm(3)). The minimum follow-up was 18 months. RESULTS: Seven of 17 patients treated with the highest total dose of 73.6 GyE experienced Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 acute skin reactions. Dose escalation was then halted at this level. No other severe acute reactions (grade > 3) were observed in this series. The overall local control rates were 88% and 73% at 1 year and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. The median survival time was 31 months (range, 2 to 60 months), and the 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 82% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy seems to be a safe and effective modality in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not eligible for surgical resection, providing good local control and offering a survival advantage without unacceptable morbidity

1	1920	Evaluation of the effect of high-energy proton irradiation treatment on meningiomas by means of 11C-L-methionine PET	Adult, Aged, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Meningioma/pa [Pathology], Meningioma/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methionine/du [Diagnostic Use], Middle Aged, Protons, Radioactivity, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Sweden, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A remnant meningioma of WHO grade I that is located at the base of the skull and is treated with radiotherapy has to be followed up for at least 5-10 years to evaluate the treatment effect and detect recurrence. The tumour has to grow considerably to show detectable volume increase on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Owing to the location at the base of the skull, a small increase in tumour volume may be hazardous. It is thus important to find a method to evaluate treatment effects earlier and potentially detect those tumours that have a tendency to grow. Nineteen patients with intracranial meningiomas were given irradiation with the 180-MeV proton beam at the Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden. The fractionation schedule used was in general a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6-Gy fractions. Serial 11C-Lmethionine PET examinations were used to evaluate the effect of stereotactic proton beam treatment. The radioactivity uptake in the tumour was evaluated as the ratio to the uptake in normal brain tissue. The follow-up period thus far is 36 months. In 15 of the 19 patients, 11C-L-methionine uptake was reduced 36 months after irradiation compared with the pre-treatment uptake of the tracer. In the total patient group the average reduction was 19.4%. Our results reveal that proton beam irradiation of meningiomas had an inhibitory effect on the methionine uptake in the meningiomas, although tumour size remained unchanged. The combination of unchanged tumour morphology and a reduction in methionine uptake after irradiation suggests that 11C-L-methionine PET might enable earlier evaluation of the treatment effect than is possible with CT or MRI

The analysis of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes after irradiation by the accelerated ions 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon and LET 10.7 keV/microm was carried out. Blood samples were irradiated on Nuclotron of the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The doses of irradiation were in the range from 0.05 up to 1.0 Gy. Was shown that the frequency of unstable chromosome aberrations depends from the dose of ionizing radiation and can be described by linear function. At the doses 0.25-0.50 Gy the dose-independent curve was obtained for dicentrics and centric rings. The frequencies of dicentrics and centric rings as markers of the radiation action were slightly different for different donors that could be explained by different radiosensitivity. Using the calibration curve obtained earlier for gamma-rays coefficients of relative biological efficiency of accelerated 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon were defined: they varied from 1.0 at the doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) up to 3.2 at the lower doses (0.05-0.25 Gy)

OBJECTIVE: To present the surgical technique of total spondylectomy for a chordoma of the C5 vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Malignant bone tumors require wide resection. Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins. METHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively.

1	1137	Recent advances in light ion radiation therapy. [Review] [50 refs]	Algorithms, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Cell Cycle/ph [Physiology], Cell Division/ph [Physiology], Cell Survival, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Hydrogen, Ions, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Motion, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/td [Trends], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Survival, Sweden, Time, Treatment Outcome, Tritium	BACKGROUND: The fast development of energy- and intensity-modulated radiation therapy during the last two decades using photon and electron beams has when implemented resulted in a considerable improvement of radiation therapy, particularly if combined with radiobiologically based treatment optimization techniques. This has made intensity-modulated electron and photon beams as powerful as today's uniform dose proton therapy. To be able to cure also the most advanced hypoxic and radiation-resistant tumors of complex local spread, intensity-modulated light ion beams are really the ultimate tool and in clinical practice 2 to 3 times less expensive per patient treated than proton therapy. This development and the recent development of advanced tumor diagnostics based on PET-CT imaging of the tumor cell density open the field for new powerful radiobiologically based treatment optimization methods. The ultimate step is to use the unique radiobiologic and dose distributional advantages of light ion beams for truly optimized bioeffect planning where the integral three-dimensional dose delivery and tumor cell survival can be monitored by PET-CT imaging and corrected by biologically based adaptive therapy optimization methods. PURPOSE: The main purpose of the present paper is to discuss the principal areas of development of therapy optimization, by considering the therapy chain from tumor diagnostics and the use of three-dimensional predictive assay to biologically based treatment optimization with special focus on the rapid clinical development of advanced light ion therapy. METHODS: Besides the "classical" approaches using low ionization density hydrogen ions (protons, but also possibly deuterons and tritium nuclei) and high ionization density carbon ions, two new approaches will be discussed. In the first one, lithium or beryllium or boron ions, which induce the least detrimental biologic effect to normal tissues for a given biologic effect in a small volume of the tumor, will be key particles. In the second approach, referred patients will be given a high-dose, high-precision "boost" treatment with carbon or oxygen ions during 1 week preceding the final treatment with conventional radiation in the referring hospital. The rationale behind these approaches is to minimize the high ionization density dose to the normal-tissue stroma outside but sometimes also inside the tumor bed and to ensure a more uniform and optimal biologic effectiveness in the tumor, also on the microscopic scale. The present discussion indicates that BIologically Optimized predictive Assay based light ion Radiation Therapy (Bio-Art) is really the ultimate way to perform high-precision radiation therapy using checkpoints of the integral dose delivery and the tumor response and, based on this information, perform compensating corrections of the dose delivery. By using biologically optimized scanned high-energy photon or ion beams, it is possible to measure in vivo the three-dimensional dose delivery using the same PET-CT camera that was used for diagnosing the tumor spread. This method thus opens up the door for truly three-dimensional biologically optimized adaptive radiation therapy, where the measured dose delivery to the true target tissues can be used to fine-adjust the incoming beams, so that possible errors in the integral therapy process are eliminated toward the end of the treatment. Interestingly enough, practically all major error sources--such as organ motion, treatment planning errors, patient setup errors, and dose delivery problems due to gantry, multileaf, or scanning beam errors--can be corrected for in this way. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Radiobiologically optimized dose delivery using intensity and radiation quality modulation based on high-resolution PET-CT or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI)-based tumor and normal-tissue imaging is probably the ultimate development of radiation therapy, taking the unique physical and biologic advantages of light ions fully into account in truly patient-individualized curative treatment schedules. Using recently available biologically based treatment ilable biologically based treatment optimization algorithms, it is possible to improve the treatment outcome for advanced tumors by as much as 10-40%. The adaptive radiotherapy process based both on three-dimensional tumor cell survival and dose delivery monitoring has the potential of percent accuracy in tumor response and dose delivery monitoring, using two-dimensional, narrow high-energy photon beam scanning and three-dimensional (11)C Bragg peak scanning for radiation quality and intensity-modulated dose delivery. There is no doubt that the future of radiation therapy is very promising, and gradually more and more patients may not even need advanced surgery. Instead, they could be cured by biologically optimized electron, photon, or light ion therapy, where the densely ionizing Bragg peak is placed solely in the gross tumor, and a lower ionization density is used in microscopically invasive tumor volumes.

1	2	Residual chromatin breaks as biodosimetry for cell killing by carbon ions	Biological Markers, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Chromatin/re [Radiation Effects], Chromosome Breakage, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Heavy Ions, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Particle Accelerators, Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Tolerance, Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], X-Rays	We have studied the relationship between cell killing and the induction of residual chromatin breaks on various human cell lines and primary cultured cells obtained by biopsy from patients irradiated with either X-rays or heavy-ion beams to identify potential bio-marker of radiosensitivity for radiation-induced cell killing. The carbon-ion beams were accelerated with the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). Six primary cultures obtained by biopsy from 6 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were irradiated with two different mono-LET beams (LET = 13 keV/micrometer, 76 keV/micrometer) and 200kV X rays. Residual chromatin breaks were measured by counting the number of non-rejoining chromatin fragments detected by the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique after a 24 hour post-irradiation incubation period. The induction rate of residual chromatin breaks per cell per Gy was the highest for 76 keV/micrometer beams on all of the cells. Our results indicated that cell which was more sensitive to the cell killing was similarly more susceptible to induction of residual chromatin breaks. Furthermore there is a good correlation between these two end points in various cell lines and primary cultured cells. This suggests that the detection of residual chromatin breaks by the PCC technique may be useful as a predictive assay of tumor response to cancer radiotherapy

For each patient the target-absorbed dose is derived from the entrance and exit doses measured by silicon diodes, on the beam axis at the patient's skin. Depending on the discrepancies observed between the measured and expected doses we have set decision levels for the corrective actions to be taken. In addition these measurements allow us to obtain information on the overall accuracy or on the quality of a specific treatment. During 5 years, 7519 patients have been measured and 79 errors were detected. Half could have induced a variation of over 10% in the dose delivered. Seventy-eight out of 79 errors were of human origin. As part of an overall quality assurance programme, it is of the utmost importance to check the dose delivered for each patient undergoing radiotherapy treatment in order to avoid systematic underdosing or overdosing

METHODS: The authors prospectively studied helium-ion irradiation and iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy in a randomized, dynamically balanced trial. Of the 184 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 86 were treated with helium ions and 98 with 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: No patients with uveal melanoma had a history of systemic malignancy. Tumors were less than 15 mm in maximum diameter and less than 10 mm in thickness. A minimum tumor dose of 70 GyE was delivered to the tumor apex. There was a significantly higher local recurrence rate after 125I brachytherapy than after helium-ion irradiation. Enucleations occurred more frequently after brachytherapy (relative risk = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-5.78). More anterior segment complications occurred after helium-ion irradiation. To date, there has been no measurable impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: Most uveal melanomas can be managed with radiation with retention of the eye. There was better tumor control with helium-ion irradiation; however, there were more anterior segment complications

In 72% of the patients a palliative effect was seen with considerable or complete pain relief. The median survival times of the patients with and without remote metastases were 7 and 15 months, respectively. Radiobiological experience leads us to expect a higher degree of efficacy when using highly ionising radiation such as neutrons. The relatively poor physical parameters of conventional neutron generators were optimised by means of a novel irradiation technique developed at the German Research Centre in Heidelberg. Using this technique, a study was started for the combined photon/neutron irradiation in recurrent sacral tumours. 14 MeV neutrons of a DT (deuterium-tritium) generator ("KARIN" supplied by Haefely) were applied as boost. 26 patients have so far been treated by this method. Palliative results are excellent and the results obtained so far have been so encouraging that an extension of the study is under consideration

A mixture of nitrogen and oxygen containing 8.0 to 8.5% of O2 was used to provoke acute hypoxia during irradiation. The applied doses of external irradiation was simultaneously increased by 40%. On the basis of a randomized study with 120 patients, acute hypoxia was found to protect healthy tissues against post-radiation damage. When the doses of 96 Gy in the paracervical space and that of 75 Gy in the pelvic wall were applied, acute side-effects decreased significantly if compared with a conventional radiotherapeutic procedure (p less than 0.01). Radiological preconditions for using acute hypoxia in radiotherapy are discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report 45 patients treated for chordoma or chondrosarcoma with postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy between 1990 and 1997. Patients had CT and MRI for 3D treatment planning performed under stereotactic guidance. Median dose at isocenter was 66.6 Gy for chordomas and 64.9 Gy for chondrosarcomas. MRI imaging was obtained in intervals after therapy to evaluate local relapse. Survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: All chondrosarcomas had achieved and maintained local control and recurrence-free status at follow-up of 5 years. Local control rate of chordomas was 82% at 2 years and 50% at 5 years. Survival was 97% at 2 years and 82% at 5 years. At maximum follow-up of 8 years local control and survival rate of chordomas was 40% (82%). Clinically significant late toxicity developed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of fractionated photon beam therapy and its success in the treatment of skull base tumors. Modern 3D treatment techniques provide superior results compared to conventional techniques. The role of high-precision radiotherapy compared to particle beam therapy in the treatment of these tumors is not yet fully clear and further research is needed

We compared the actual (clinical) response with the predicted response estimated using our past experimental and clinical data, and discussed some problems to be overcome in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted an intravenous drip infusion of the compound whereby 170 mg/kg of the drug was administered over 4-5 hours before neutron irradiation. The patient was then irradiated with thermal neutrons from the Musashi Reactor at a reactor power of 100 kW and a neutron flux of 1.0 x 10(9) n/cm2/s at the collimator surface. The total absorbed dose to the melanoma and the surrounding skin was calculated by multiplying the thermal neutron fluences by the conversion factor. RESULTS: The total absorbed doses to the melanoma and the surrounding normal skin were calculated as 19.0 and 9.4 Gy, respectively. These absorbed doses were estimated at 33.5 and 14.2 RBE-Gy, respectively, assuming that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the high LET radiations was 2.0 and that each component of the mixed radiation was simply additive. The melanoma showed marked regression with mild skin reaction (dry desquamation) a month after therapy, and finally disappeared 10 months after therapy. There were no no substantial side effects. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the outcome of our calculated dose values agreed well with the clinical response and that their compatibility indicated considerable validity for our approach. However, there are still some problems-uncertainty concerning the 10B concentration in tumor and skin, determination of the total absorbed dose, and a single curative dose for malignant melanoma-to be overcome with regard to clinical use of this therapy

METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was sent to 198 German radiotherapy institutions. Data about patient characteristics, stage of disease, practice and fractionation of radiotherapy, outcome of therapy, etc. were systematically evaluated. 123 of 198 institutions answered the complete questionnaire (62.1%). RESULTS: Only 23 of the 123 institutions (18.7%) reported experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of adults. 18 institutions with 98 patients were evaluable. The majority of patients (72 of 98) was treated on a linear accelerator. The median single dose of radiotherapy was 2 Gy, while the median total dose was 24 Gy. 81 of 89 evaluable patients (91%) reached a local control of the treated lesion(s), 69 of those had a complete remission. Eight of 89 patients (9%) developed an in-field recurrence. 87.8% of patients experienced no acute and 97% of patients no late side effects of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis in adults in Germany is still very limited. Nevertheless, the clinical results-with high remission and local control rates-confirm the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the multidisciplinary treatment of this disease. Due to the small number of patients in this study despite higher incidence rates, the knowledge of this disease has to be multiplied in Germany. Future patients should be systematically included into a prospective radiotherapy registry

The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads

0	3260	Photoneutrons from high energy medical linear accelerators: measurement of the spectrum and dose using a miniature proportional counter	Humans, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Pressure, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: A new method of measuring photoneutron dose to the patient during treatment with high energy photon or electron beams is presented. This method has the advantage of providing not only the dose, but the microdosimetric spectrum at the same time. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A miniature cylindrical gas proportional counter (0.5 mm diameter by 0.5 mm height) has been used to measure scatter radiation from a 20 MV teletherapy photon beam. At atmospheric pressure, filled with propane base tissue equivalent gas, this counter simulates a unit density tissue region of approximately 0.9 microns. We present here single event microdosimetric spectra measured outside the primary beam 1.4 m from the target. This technique allows a single measurement to determine the scattered dose due to gammas and photoneutron contamination, as well as the quality factor of the photoneutrons. RESULTS: Spectral components from scattered photons and the photoneutrons are easily separated, and dose contributions can be estimated. The ratio of photoneutron dose measured by the proportional counter to photon dose at isocenter is 0.75 x 10(-4). CONCLUSIONS: Neutron dose was also measured using a bubble neutrometer. The proportional counter and neutrometer agree within experimental errors. This type of instrument is shown to be a viable technique for determination of exposure of patient and also personnel to photoneutrons, providing not only a dose determination, but also a spectrum that can be used to estimate quality factors for equivalent dose. Its main drawback is that it requires a lengthy (several hours) measurement because of low count rate of the neutrons	
1	282	Is proton beam therapy cost effective in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate?[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/ec [Economics], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Male, Markov Chains, Middle Aged, Photons, Probability, Prostatic Neoplasms/ec [Economics], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Research	PURPOSE: New treatments are introduced routinely into clinical practice without rigorous economic analysis. The specific aim of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of proton beam radiation compared with current state-of-the art therapy in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Materials and METHODS: A Markov model was informed with cost, freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), and utility data obtained from the literature and from patient interviews to compare the cost effectiveness of 91.8 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) delivered with proton beam versus 81 CGE delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The length of how many years the model was run, patient's age, probability of FFBF after treatment with proton beam therapy and IMRT, utility of patients treated with salvage hormone therapy, and treatment cost were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Analysis at 15 years resulted in an expected mean cost of proton beam therapy and IMRT of $63,511 and $36,808, and $64,989 and $39,355 for a 70-year-old and 60-year-old man respectively, with quality-adjusted survival of 8.54 and 8.12 and 9.91 and 9.45 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to be $63,578/QALY for a 70-year-old man and $55,726/QALY for a 60-year-old man. CONCLUSION: Even when based on the unproven assumption that protons will permit a 10-Gy escalation of prostate dose compared with IMRT photons, proton beam therapy is not cost effective for most patients with prostate cancer using the commonly accepted standard of $50,000/QALY. Consideration should be given to limiting the number of proton facilities to allow comprehensive evaluation of this modality

1	3341	On the use of effective dose in the treatment planning of high linear-energy-transfer radiation	Algorithms, Biometry, British Columbia, Canada, Energy Transfer, Health Physics, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Mesons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities	Treatment planning for conventional radiations is based on the assumption that the effect of a combination of doses at any location in the treatment field in a multibeam plan will be equivalent to that of a single dose made up of the total sum of the doses delivered to that location. This is obviously valid for conventional low linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiations when the dose contributions from various beam components are associated with the same relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value of unity. However, this is not the case for the new generation of charged particle beams whose RBEs have been shown to vary significantly with depth. A concept of effective dose, defined as the mathematical product of physical dose and RBE value evaluated for an effect level, is developed for the treatment planning of these high-LET particle radiations. Based on radiobiological results in mixed radiation experiments, it is shown that these effective doses are linearly additive like physical doses and hence, can be used directly for general treatment planning using linear algorithms already developed for the use of physical doses. This is illustrated using examples of simplified one-dimensional plans for the TRIUMF pion beam	
1	94	Sacrococcygeal chordomas: potential role of high LET therapy. [Review] [27 refs]	Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Pelvic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Sacrococcygeal Region, Survival Rate	Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms representing less than 3% of all primary bone tumors. They usually have a benign histological appearance and a slow growth rate. Their locoregional progression nearly always causes suffering and eventually death. Efforts to increase local control have included aggressive surgery, radiation therapy or combined approaches but locally free survival rates remain relatively low and have not exceeded 30% at 5 years. Sacrococcygeal chordomas, which represent approximately 50% of the localizations, have been investigated less frequently than those at the base of the skull or cervical region with primary or post-operative radiation therapy. The disappointing results with photon therapy in a multimodality approach and the good results reported by Schoenthaler with charged particles in the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory led us to propose fast neutron therapy in the management of inoperable or recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. Preliminary results obtained from only 12 patients indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy seems to be a good alternative for radical treatment of chordomas in the case of microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor.

There are several methods of managing them. Validity of these methods, however, is not sufficiently studied. We therefore investigated, whether moist skin care with 3% urea lotion will reduce acute radiation skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with carcinomas of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy with curative intent (mean total dose 60 Gy, range: 50-74 Gy) were evaluated weekly for acute skin reactions according to the RTOG-CTC score. In 63 patients, moist skin care with 3% urea lotion was performed. The control group consisted of 25 patients receiving conventional dry skin care. The incidence of grade I, II, and III reactions and the radiation dose at occurrence of a particular reaction were determined and statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. The dose-time relations of individual skin reactions are described. RESULTS: At some point of time during radiotherapy, all patients suffered from acute skin reactions grade I, > 90% from grade II reactions. 50% of patients receiving moist skin care experienced grade I reactions at 26 Gy as compared to 22 Gy in control patients (p = 0.03). Grade II reactions occurred at 51 Gy versus 34 Gy (p = 0.006). Further, 22% of the patients treated with moist skin care suffered from acute skin toxicity grade III as compared to 56% of the controls (p = 0.0007).

To be able to fully utilize the advantages of these techniques correct patient positioning is an important prerequisite. This study employing an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) investigated the positioning uncertainties that occur in the pelvic region for different patient positioning devices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 patients with prostate cancer were irradiated with or without rectal balloon/pelvic mask at a linear accelerator with multileaf collimator (MLC). For each patient multiple portal images were taken from different directions and compared to the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) of the treatment planning system and to simulation films (Table 1, Figure 1). RESULTS: In spite of different positioning devices, all patients showed comparable total positioning uncertainties of 4.0 mm (lateral), 4.5 mm (cranio-caudal) and 1.7 mm (dorso-ventral). The lateral positioning error was reduced for the pelvic mask patients while the cranio-caudal error increased (Table 2, Figure 2). A systematic and a random component sum up to the total positioning error, and a good estimate of the magnitudes of the two is possible from six to eight portal images (Figure 3). CONCLUSIONS: With a small number of portal images it is possible to find out the systematic and random positioning error of a patient. Knowledge of the random error can be used to resize the treatment margin which is clinically relevant since this error differs greatly for different patients (Figure 4). Image analysis with EPID is convenient, yet has some problems. For example, one only gets indirect information on the movement of the ventral rectum wall (Figure 5). The successful operation of positioning devices, although, needs further improvement--especially if one focuses on IMRT

The localisation and locally-destructive growth require a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic concept early on. The goal of the present study was to present a reproducible strategy for quality assurance. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the hospital records of 10 consecutive patients (4 women and 6 men) whom we had treated during a period of 7 years. RESULTS: The first step in therapy was tumour resection in 9 cases. One patient initially underwent stereotactic radiation. Postoperative radiation was not included a priori, but discussed individually depending on the degree of resection, the patient's age and physical condition. After an average 5 years follow up, 100 % of patients are alive. In all patients, tumour control was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with chordomas of the skull base has improved considerably in recent years. New technologies like intraoperative navigation and improved radiation procedures have contributed to this improvement. The basis for treatment remains, however, the greatest possible surgical exstirpation with minimal surgical morbidity. Special attention should be paid in this connection to the stability of the cervical spine and the craniocervical transition border. In advanced tumour growth, complete resection is often not possible. Proton and heavy-ion radiation are promising new forms of therapy, which can also be applied after conventional radiation has been performed.

1	1849	Potential role of intensity modulated proton beams in prostate cancer radiotherapy	Femur Head, Head, Humans, Male, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Risk, Switzerland, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, Urinary Bladder, X-Rays	PURPOSE: The present study was undertaken to assess the potential benefit of intensity modulated (IM) proton beams in optimizing the dose distribution to safely escalate the tumor dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four treatment plans were compared in a prostate cancer patient aiming to deliver 81 Gy to the target: 1) conformal 18 MV X-rays, 6-fields; 2) 214 MeV protons, 2-fields; 3) IM 15 MV X-rays, 5-fields; and 4) 177-200 Mev IM protons, 5-fields as in Plan 3. In addition, IM methods were used to further escalate the tumor dose to 99 Gy. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used to physically compare the treatment plans. DVH data were also used to obtain normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the rectum, bladder, femoral heads, and tumor control probabilities. RESULTS: Although the planning target volume dose distribution was satisfactory with the four treatment plans, the homogeneity was slightly reduced in both X-ray plans (IM and standard) and the low-to-medium doses delivered to all organs at risk, and other normal tissues were significantly reduced by both proton plans. For a prescribed dose of 81 Gy, only the IM X-ray and IM proton plans both succeeded in predicting an acceptably low NTCP for the rectum (<5%, Grade 3). The integral nontarget dose was significantly reduced with IM proton beams (i.e., 3.1, 1.3, and 1.7 times less than Plans 1, 2, and 3, respectively). When escalating the dose to 99 Gy, no additional improvement between IM protons and IM X-ray beams was observed. CONCLUSION: Both IM X-ray and proton beams were able to optimize the dose distribution and comply with the goal of delivering the highest dose to the target while reducing the risk of severe morbidity to acceptable levels. The main advantage compared to IM X-rays was that IM protons succeeded in significantly reducing the low-to-medium dose to the nontarget tissues and achieved a small improvement in planning target volume (PTV) dose heterogeneity

[Review] [121 refs]	Animals, Boron, Boron Compounds/an [Analysis], Boron Compounds/ch [Chemistry], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Clinical Protocols, Energy Transfer, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Massachusetts, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiobiology, Survival, Time	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the preferential targeting of tumor cells with (10)B and subsequent activation with thermal neutrons to produce a highly localized radiation. In theory, it is possible to selectively irradiate a tumor and the associated infiltrating tumor cells with large single doses of high-LET radiation while sparing the adjacent normal tissues. The mixture of high- and low-LET dose components created in tissue during neutron irradiation complicates the radiobiology of BNCT. Much of the complexity has been unravelled through a combination of preclinical experimentation and clinical dose escalation experience. Over 350 patients have been treated in a number of different facilities worldwide. The accumulated clinical experience has demonstrated that BNCT can be delivered safely but is still defining the limits of normal brain tolerance. Several independent BNCT clinical protocols have demonstrated that BNCT can produce median survivals in patients with glioblastoma that appear to be equivalent to conventional photon therapy. This review describes the individual components and methodologies required for effect BNCT: the boron delivery agents; the analytical techniques; the neutron beams; the dosimetry and radiation biology measurements; and how these components have been integrated into a series of clinical studies. The single greatest weakness of BNCT at the present time is non-uniform delivery of boron into all tumor cells. Future improvements in BNCT effectiveness will come from improved boron delivery agents, improved boron administration protocols, or through combination of BNCT with other modalities.

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment.

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam.

0	2667	Execution of a single-isocenter three-field technique, using a multileaf collimator or tray-mounted cerrobend blocks: effect on treatment time	Axilla, Belgium, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Female, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Time, Time Factors, Universities	PURPOSE: In this article, we studied the total treatment time of a single-isocenter three-field irradiation of breast and axilla, using either tray-mounted cerrobend blocks, or a multileaf collimator (MLC) for field shaping. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 20 female, unselected patients were given 50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) on breast and 46 Gy on axilla and supraclavicular region (2 Gy/fraction). Patients were randomized between two different treatment groups. The first group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-75 linear accelerator (SL-75), using 5 MV photons with tray-mounted cerrobend blocks. The second group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-25 linear accelerator, using 6 MV photons and a MLC (SL-25-MLC). RESULTS: Although the beam-on time on the SL-25-MLC was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to the SL-75, overall treatment time was significantly shorter using a MLC instead of tray-mounted cerrobend blocks (p < 0.0001). The difference in total treatment time was in the range of 100 s per patient per day. The main difference between the two accelerators was observed when setup of the second and third field was done using the automatic setup facility of the SL-25-MLC (avoids entering the treatment room). A mean time gain of 124 s per treatment session was observed using automatic setup. Considering the yearly number of patients receiving this treatment, a total time gain equivalent to 16.15 8-h workdays was calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a technique using tray-mounted cerrobend blocks in the single-isocenter three-field irradiation of a breast and axilla, a MLC combined with automatic field setup provides a significant time advantage, by reducing the number of manipulations inside the treatment room

This paper discusses the potential of 211At targeted by antibodies for tumor therapy and the possible advantage of 211At over beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides such as 131I currently employed in the field of radioimmunotherapy. Since the longest range alpha-particle from 211At is only 67 microns and the rate of energy loss is high (track averaged linear energy transfer LT approximately 120 keV/micron), a disintegration of 211At produces a large and extremely localized deposition of energy. A Monte-Carlo model has been developed for studying the stochastic fluctuation of alpha-particle hits and energy deposition in cell nuclei in an attempt to determine the efficacy of 211At-labeled antibodies for tumor cell inactivation. Calculations have been performed for 2 extreme conditions: (a) the case of 211At retained in the capillary, and (b) for a homogeneous distribution of 211At-labeled antibody in the tumor. The results of these two calculations represent the boundary conditions between which any real solution must lie. Finally, developments to the model to include antibody transport across the capillary membrane and through the tumor tissue are discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the records of 74 patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1957 and 1995. The histologic types included squamous cell carcinoma in 6 (8.1%), nonkeratinizing carcinoma in 48 (64.9%), and undifferentiated carcinoma in 20 (27%) cases. The site of recurrence was in the primary in 46 (62.2%), in the neck nodes in 20 (27%), and in both sites in 8 (10.8%) patients. The recurrent disease was Stage I in 10 (13.5%), Stage II in 16 (21.6%), Stage III in 20 (27%), and Stage IV in 28 (37.9%) patients. Thirty-seven (50%) patients developed recurrence within 2 years and 58 (78.4%) within 5 years after initial treatment. Radiotherapeutic techniques used in the retreatment of primary recurrence consisted of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), intracavitary brachytherapy, heavy-charged particle beam, and gamma knife, alone or in combination. Reirradiation doses ranged from 18 to 108 Gy, with a median dose of 60 Gy. Treatment of recurrent neck nodes consisted of radical neck dissection (RND) +/- intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), or EBRT +/- hyperthermia, or chemotherapy +/- hyperthermia. Chemotherapy was used in 22 (30%) patients. Median follow-up was 20 months (range: 2 to 308 months). RESULTS: The 3-, 5-, and 10-year actuarial overall survival following retreatment were 49, 37, 18%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (49%) were free of further local-regional recurrence after retreatment. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year local-regional progression-free rates were 52, 40, and 38%, respectively. On univariate analysis, histologic type (p < 0.0001), interval to recurrence (p = 0.034), and treatment modality for early-stage disease (p = 0.01) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival, with age being marginally significant (p = 0.053). For local-regional progression-free rate, only histology was significant (p = 0.035). On multivariate analysis, age (p = 0.026), histology (p = 0.015), and interval to recurrence (p = 0.030) were significant for overall survival, and only histology (p = 0.002) and presence of complications (p = 0.016) were significant for local-regional progression-free rate. Of the 64 reirradiated patients, late complications were documented in 29 (45%) patients. The late complications were permanent in 21 (33%) and severe in 15 (23%) patients. CONCLUSION: Retreatment using radiotherapy alone or in combination with other treatment modalities can achieve long-term local-regional control and survival in a substantial proportion of patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Age, histology, and interval to recurrence were independent prognostic factors for overall survival, but only histology and presence of complications were significant for local-regional progression-free rate

Although they do not usually show cytological atypia, metastases have been reported in 30 per cent of cases. Survival rates in cases of skull base locations are low, and local recurrence is common after local excision. Radiation therapy is used in post-operative treatment and proton radiation therapy as the primary treatment. In the present paper we present the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian man affected by chordoma of the clivus, with liver and chest metastases, relapsed after several surgical local excisions, to discuss improvements in therapeutic and imaging techniques. Indium111 (In111) pentetreotide single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed to assess the presence of somatostatin receptors and to treat the tumour with radiolabelled Y90-DOTA-lanreotide. Imaging, performed 2 months afterwards, showed stable disease in the lungs but a local progression in the metastases, in comparison with pre-treatment uptake. These data suggest the usefulness of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues in the diagnosis and therapy of chordomas

A patient with Hodgkin's disease has been chosen as an example and has been planned with different radiation treatment modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate mortality from dose distributions. To this purpose target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. From the mean doses of each organ the mortality has been derived. Our work suggests that calculations of mortality can be useful in comparative treatment planning. Such mortality calculations can be helpful to find decisions between radiotherapy treatment techniques (intensity modulated or conventional treatment) or between different types of radiation (photons, electrons, protons, neutrons)

On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

Positions and sizes of the ocular nozzle elements were initially defined based on experimental work, taking as a pattern functional existing facilities. Nowadays Monte Carlo (MC) calculation offers a tool to refine this geometry by adjusting size and place of beam modeling devices. Moreover, the MC tool is a useful way to calculate the dose and to evaluate the impact of secondary particles in the field of radiotherapy or radiation protection. Both LINAC and cyclotron producing x rays, electrons, protons, and neutrons are available in CAL, which suggests choosing MCNPX for its particle versatility. As a first step, the existing installation was input in MCNPX to check its aptitude to reproduce experimentally measured depth-dose profile, lateral profile, output-factor (OF), and absolute dose. The geometry was defined precisely and described from the last achromatic bending magnet of our proton beam line to the position of treated eyes. Relative comparisons of percentage depth-dose and lateral profiles, performed between measured data and simulations, show an agreement of the order of 2% in dose and 0.1 mm in range accuracy. These comparisons, carried out with and without beam-modifying device, yield results compatible to the required precision in ocular melanoma treatments, as long as adequate choices are made on MCNPX input decks for physics card. Absolute dose and OF issued from calculations and measurements were also compared. Results obtained for these two kinds of data, carried out in the simplified situation of an unmodulated beam, indicate that MC calculation could effectively complement measurements. These encouraging results are a large source of motivation to promote further studies, first in a new design of the ocular nozzle, and second in the analysis of the influence of beam-modifying devices attached to the final patient collimator, such as wedge or compensators, on dose values

In view of this, pilot studies were instituted at Massachusetts General Hospital in which 32 patients received the standard previous treatment of external beam irradiation and surgery but in addition had an intraoperative electron beam boost of 1000-1500 rad to the remaining tumor or tumor bed. For the 16 patients who presented with unresectable primary lesions, the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy has resulted in a total absence of local recurrence with a minimum 20 month follow-up, and survival rates are statistically better than for the previous group treated with only external beam irradiation and surgical resection. In the group with residual disease, again there have not been any local recurrences in the 7 patients who received all treatment modalities versus 54% and 26% for the group with gross and microscopic residual treated with only external beam techniques. The remaining 9 patients presented with recurrent unresectable lesions--3 are alive (2 NED) at greater than or equal to 3 years

This study was to evaluate prognostic factors of patients with cerebral glioma treated with radiotherapy. METHODS: Records of 158 patients with cerebral glioma, including 123 patients with astrocytoma (AC), 12 patients with oligodendroglioma (OD) or mixed oligoastrocytoma (OA), and 23 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), received radiotherapy in our center were analyzed. Eighty patients received total resection, 77 received subtotal resection, and 1 received biopsy before radiotherapy. Median radiation dose was 58 Gy (36-75 Gy). Median waiting time from operation to radiotherapy was 29 days (12-261 days). Sixty-eight patients received chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy. Cox model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23 months (2-62 months), 27 patients relapsed, and 57 patients died. The 2- and 4-year overall survival rate were 66.5% and 45.7%. Univariate analysis showed that histologic grade (I/II vs. II/IV), histologic type (AC/OD vs. GBM), Karnofsky performance state (KPS) before radiotherapy (>/=80 vs.< 80), extent of resection (total vs non-total), and age(</=40 years vs. >40 years) were significant predictors in association with overall survival rate of patients with glioma. Multivariate analysis showed that histologic grade (P=0.001), age (P=0.006), KPS before radiotherapy (P=0.009), and extent of resection (P=0.037) were independent prognostic factors of glioma. CONCLUSION: Low grade (I/II), age </=40 years, KPS>/=80 before radiotherapy, and total resection are independent factors for predicting better survival of glioma patients

(Follow-up times ranged from 6 to 90 months; median 26.4 months.) At last examination, 92 of 186 patients (49%) had visual acuity of 20/200 or better in the treated eye. Univariate statistical analysis revealed that post-treatment vision correlated with tumor size, distance between tumor and optic disc, distance between tumor and fovea, pretreatment visual acuity, dose delivered to the optic disc, and dose delivered to the fovea (p less than .05). Neither the maximum tumor dose nor site of tumor origin (ciliary body vs. choroid) correlated with post-treatment vision on a univariate basis. However, multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the strongest independent risk factors influencing vision outcome (p less than .05) were tumor size, pretreatment visual acuity, tumor-fovea distance, and maximum tumor dose. Neither the fovea dose nor the dose to optic disc appeared to significantly affect vision outcome when other variables were taken into account. These results suggest that post-treatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better can be achieved in one-half of uveal melanoma patients treated using helium ion irradiation. Several independent risk factors affecting vision outcome have been identified

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

1	1323	Visual complications of proton beam therapy for clival chordoma	Adult, Aged, Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy, Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: Combining maximal surgical resection with high-dose proton radiation therapy is reported to be currently the best management of patients with clival chordoma. METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage	
1	4084	Advanced prostate cancer: the results of a randomized comparative trial of high dose irradiation boosting with conformal protons compared with conventional dose irradiation using photons alone.[see comment]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Arm, Boston, Clinical Protocols, Cobalt, Data Interpretation,Statistical, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pc [Prevention & Control], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prospective Studies, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectum, Research, Survival, Urethral Stricture/et [Etiology], Urethral Stricture/su [Surgery], Urinary Bladder Diseases/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: Following a thorough Phase I/II study, we evaluated by a Phase III trial high versus conventional dose external beam irradiation as mono-therapy for patients with Stage T3-T4 prostate cancer. Patient outcome following standard dose radiotherapy or following a 12.5% increase in total dose to 75.6 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) using a conformal perineal proton boost was compared for local tumor control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stage T3-T4, Nx, N0-2, M0 patients received 50.4 Gy by four-field photons and were randomized to receive either an additional 25.2 CGE by conformal protons (arm 1--the high dose arm, 103 patients, total dose 75.6 CGE) or an additional 16.8 Gy by photons (arm 2--the conventional dose arm, 99 patients, total dose 67.2 Gy). Actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), total recurrence-free survival (TRFS), (clinically free, prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 4ng/ml and a negative prostate rebiopsy, done in 38 patients without evidence of disease) and local control (digital rectal exam and rebiopsy negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 90% for arm 1 and 97% for arm 2. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range 3 to 139 months) 135 patients are alive and 67 have died, 20 from causes other than prostate cancer. We found no significant differences in OS, DSS, TRFS or local control between the two arms. Among those completing randomized treatment (93 in arm 1 and 96 in arm 2), the local control at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 92% and 77%, respectively and is 80% and 60%, respectively for arm 2 (p = .089) and there are no significant differences in OS, DSS, and TRFS. The local control for the 57 patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason 4 or 5 of 5) tumors at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 94% and 84% and is 64% and 19% on arm 2 (p = 0.0014). In patients whose digital rectal exam had normalized following treatment and underwent prostate rebiopsy there was a lower positive rebiopsy rate for arm 1 versus arm 2 patients (28 vs. 45%) and also for those with well and moderately differentiated tumors versus poorly differentiated tumors (32 and 50%). These differences were not statistically significant. Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding is higher (32 vs. 12%, p = 0.002) as may be urethral stricture (19 vs. 8%, p = 0.07) in the arm 1 versus arm 2. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in prostate tumor dose by external beam of 12.5% to 75.6 CGE by a conformal proton boost compared to a conventional dose of 67.2 Gy by a photon boost significantly improved local control only in patients with poorly differentiated tumors. It has increased late radiation sequelae, and as yet, has not increased overall survival, disease-specific survival, or total recurrence-free survival in any subgroup. These results have led us to test by a subsequent Phase III trial the potential beneficial effect on local control and disease-specific survival of a 12.5% increase in total dose relative to conventional dose in patients with T1, T2a, and T2b tumors

Twelve patients received silicone tubes and were compared to a control group of 12 patients with irradiated nasal tumors without silicone tubes. Symptoms of nasolacrimal duct obstruction and epiphora were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. All patients had nasolacrimal duct irrigation. Patients intubated before irradiation maintained patency (11 of 12), whereas those in the control group did not (zero of 12) (P less than .0014); ten of 12 control patients had closure of both superior and inferior puncta. No significant difference in symptoms of epiphora was observed between the two groups

This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

1	4151	Applications of asymmetric collimation on linear accelerators	California, Californium, Cohort Studies, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Universities	Frequency of use of asymmetric collimation (AC) at an academic radiation oncology center equipped with AC-capable linear accelerators was determined, and the type of use was cataloged. Records of patients beginning radiation treatment at U.C. Davis Cancer Center within a 3-month period (3/1/92 to 5/31/92) were reviewed. Forty-seven percent of 102 patients and 56% of 123 courses of treatment involved AC. Six common uses of AC were identified: beam-split field matching, planned boosts, other field size changes, adjustments to match divergent fields, matchline feathering, and opposed tangential fields. This study demonstrates that asymmetric collimation is a useful and powerful clinical treatment tool with widespread applications to radiation therapy	
1	4091	Stereotactic radiotherapy: a technique for dose optimization and escalation for intracranial tumors	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Brain/pa [Pathology], Brain/su [Surgery], Child, Child,Preschool, Dose Fractionation, Head, Humans, Infant, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radiation Dosage, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Research, Treatment Outcome, Women	Stereotactic radiosurgery offers the ability to treat relatively small volume intracranial lesions with single fraction, high dose radiotherapy while sparing surrounding tissue due to rapid fall off of dose outside of the treatment volume. Conventional radiotherapy takes advantage of the sparing effects of dose fractionation, but includes relatively large amounts of normal brain in the treatment volume the tolerance of which is dose-limiting. For some intracranial lesions it may not be optimal to treat with large single fractions due to tumor location or size. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy may not be optimum in all cases due to the necessary inclusion of normal structures. Through the development of relocatable head frames, the precision of stereotactic techniques and the biologic advantages of fractionation may be combined in stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). We report on the treatment of 68 patients with intracranial lesions using a dedicated stereotactic linear accelerator to deliver SRT between June 1992 and June 1993. SRT was used either in order to optimize dose distribution and spare normal tissues in patients with excellent prognosis or in order to increase the dose to tumor while keeping doses to normal tissues below tolerance levels in patients with poorer prognosis (dose escalation). Histologies treated included meningioma, low grade astrocytoma, pituitary adenoma and acoustic neuroma. The most common treatment sites were the parasellar region and cavernous sinuses. Most patients (79%) had surgical debulking prior to SRT. 10-12 patients were treated daily. Patient positioning using relocatable stereotactic frames was highly precise. Acute and subacute side effects were minimal and radiographic responses have been similar to those expected with conventional radiotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients aged > or =80 years with HCC underwent proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 80 to 85 years (median, 81 years). Hepatic tumors were solitary in 17 patients and multiple in 4. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 135 mm (median, 40 mm) in maximum diameter. Ten, 5, and 6 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 60 Gy in 10 fractions, 66 Gy in 22 fractions, and 70 Gy in 35 fractions, respectively, according to tumor location. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period of 6-49 months (median, 16 months). Five patients showed new hepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume, 2-13 months after treatment, and 1 of them also had lung metastasis. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 100% and 72% at 3 years, respectively. Of 21 patients, 7 died 6-49 months after treatment; 2 patients each died of trauma and old age, and 1 patient each died of HCC, pneumonia, and arrhythmia. The 3-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 62%, 88%, and 51%, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or = 3 but thrombocytopenia in 2 patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy seems to be tolerable, effective, and safe for aged patients with HCC. It may contribute to prolonged survival due to tumor control

The local control rate, cause-specific survival rate, and overall survival rate of 141 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC were 82%, 58%, and 42%, respectively. Radiation pneumonia was rare (2.1%) and not serious. In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate achieved in 50 patients was 100%, with no radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 60% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beam therapy, excellent local control comparable to that in stage INSCLC has been demonstrated and offers hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer.

Most published studies on radiation toxicity have been performed retrospectively. Our prospective study was launched in 1996 to measure the in vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes before treatment with radical radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer, and to assess the early and the late radiation skin side effects in the same group of patients. We prospectively recruited consecutive breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy after breast surgery. To evaluate whether early and late side effects of radiotherapy can be predicted by the assay, a study was conducted of the association between the results of in vitro radiosensitivity tests and acute and late adverse radiation effects. METHODS: Intrinsic molecular radiosensitivity was measured by using an initial radiation-induced DNA damage assay on lymphocytes obtained from breast cancer patients before radiotherapy. Acute reactions were assessed in 108 of these patients on the last treatment day. Late morbidity was assessed after 7 years of follow-up in some of these patients. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) morbidity score system was used for both assessments. RESULTS: Radiosensitivity values obtained using the in vitro test showed no relation with the acute or late adverse skin reactions observed. There was no evidence of a relation between acute and late normal tissue reactions assessed in the same patients. A positive relation was found between the treatment volume and both early and late side effects. CONCLUSION: After radiation treatment, a number of cells containing major changes can have a long survival and disappear very slowly, becoming a chronic focus of immunological system stimulation. This stimulation can produce, in a stochastic manner, late radiation-related adverse effects of varying severity. Further research is warranted to identify the major determinants of normal tissue radiation response to make it possible to individualize treatments and improve the outcome of radiotherapy in cancer patients

Detailed results have been published previously [17]. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1972 and 1993, 57 patients were treated curatively with radiation alone (n = 13) or combined surgery and pre- and/or postoperative irradiation (n = 44). Gross complete resection was achieved in 82% of patients and margins were negative in 5 patients. Doses ranged from 36.0 to 79.2 Gy (median 64.8 Gy), usually conventionally fractionated. In 16 patients protons were used. Median follow-up time was 4.3 years (range 1.1 to 16.8 years). RESULTS: After 5 years, patients with angiosarcomas (n = 11) and patients with other tumor types (n = 46) had locoregional control rates of 24% and 69%, distant failure rates of 58% and 17%, and overall survival rates of (for overall survival) and T stage (for locoregional control) (p < 0.05). Particularly, gross completely resected T1 tumors had a locoregional control rate of 91%. Patients with locoregional recurrence were at an increased risk to die (p = 0.004 in multivariate analysis). Patients with and without direct tumor extension to neurovascular structures, bones, organs, or skin had distant failure rates of 27% and 0%, respectively (p = 0.031). In multivariate analysis, direct extension was additionally a negative prognosticator of overall survival (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: 1. Angiosarcomas of the head and neck have a considerably poorer prognosis than other soft tissue sarcomas of this region. 2. Head and neck sarcomas have a higher local recurrence rate than for example soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. Optimisation of local treatment through combination of surgery and high-dose irradiation, however, can achieve improved results, especially for prognostically favourable subgroups. 3. In addition to tumor grade and size, direct tumor extension may be a useful additional staging parameter

[Japanese]	Head, Humans, Japan, Lead, Male, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Postoperative Care, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Scattering,Radiation, Seminoma/th [Therapy], Testicular Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Testis	This study aimed to decrease the radiation dose to the disease-free testis in postoperative irradiation for seminoma patients. We consider the factors influencing the peripheral dose (PD) of 10MV X-ray radiotherapy to be the distance between the caudal edge of the irradiation field and the measuring point, the size of the therapeutic irradiation field, the thickness of the lead shield laid above and lateral to the disease-free testis, and the thickness of the lateral absorber. Materials and methods: We measured the scattering radiation dose coming from the accelerator head and that due to irradiation volume. We measured these doses using a testicular phantom as the non-diseased testis.Results: Scattering radiation from the accelerator head mainly contributes to PD, whereas the larger the size of the irradiation field the more the scattering radiation from the irradiation volume contributed to PD. PD changed more at the surface of the phantom than at its center. PD at the testicular phantom could be reduced to less than 1% of the therapeutic dose when it was situated more than 5cm distant from the caudal limit of the irradiation field, the lead shield above the testicular phantom was 7.5cm thick, and the lateral lead shield was 2mm thick.Conclusions: PD is influenced by many factors. It is necessary to clarify the change in PD at the testicular phantom, and it is important to limit the caudal edge of the irradiation field and to lay the lead shield for the attenuation of radiation on the disease-free testis

The authors submitted 23 patients complaining of LCN with CT documented intrapelvic or paraaortic tumors to palliative radiotherapy. Megavoltage external beam irradiation was administered using a 6-MV linear accelerator. Treatment field sizes ranged from 56 cm2 to 235 cm2 (mean: 150.54 cm2) and encompassed only the site where the disease involved the lumbosacral plexus or its branches. > or = 3 Gy/day fractions were used. Twenty-one of 22 assessable patients (95.4%) obtained LCN pain relief; 19 (86.3%) obtained complete LCN pain relief. The median time to pain progression (TPP) was 150 days (range: 39-510 days). The median survival was 165 days. Seven patients were LCN pain-free at death. Two patients are alive and LCN pain-free. The remaining 12 patients had recurrent LCN pain: four of them were reirradiated at the site of previous neuropathy and only two had partial relief again. The authors conclude that it is advisable to submit to palliative radiotherapy the inoperable disseminated and/or recurrent cancer patients complaining of LCN, to use large fractions not to occupy the extant time of their already short life-expectancy, and to design small fields to avoid acute side-effects

Cytogenetic aberrations, growth alterations, responses to a second irradiation, and mutant frequencies at the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and thymidine kinase loci were determined. A greater percentage of clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles exhibited instability (defined as clones showing one or more outlying characteristics) than in the case of those that survived gamma irradiation. The phenotypes of the unstable clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles were also qualitatively different from those of the clones that survived gamma irradiation. A greater percentage (20%) of the unstable clones that survived gamma irradiation than those that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles (4%) showed an altered response to the second irradiation, while an increase in the percentage of clones that had an outlying frequency of ouabain-resistant and thymidine kinase mutants was more evident in the clones exposed to (56)Fe particles than in those exposed to gamma rays. Growth alterations and increases in dicentric chromosomes were found only in clones with more than one alteration. These results underscore the complex nature of genomic instability and the likelihood that radiation-induced genomic instability arises from different original events

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study reviewed 46 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 1998 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All patients had locoregionally confined disease; all but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 46 patients, 40 received combinations of X-rays (median, 48 Gy) and protons (median, 31.7 Gy) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-ray and proton radiation for the 40 patients was 76.0 Gy (range, 69.1-87.4 Gy). The remaining 6 patients received only proton beam therapy (median, 82.0 Gy; range, 75-89.5 Gy). RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 46 patients, patients with T1 (n = 23), and those with T2-T4 (n = 23) was 34%, 55%, and 13%, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for the 46 patients, those with T1, and those with T2-T4 was 67%, 95%, and 33%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate for patients with T1 and T2-T4 lesions was 83% and 29%, respectively. The site of the first relapse was locoregional for 16 patients and distant organs for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally confined esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedule, and best combinations of protons and conventional X-rays with or without chemotherapy

The patient characteristics were no different from those noted in previous studies. Patients were treated either with 60Co teletherapy units or 4 MeV linear accelerators with different daily (180-225) and weekly (4 times vs. 5 times) fractionation schemes. A recurrent-free survival was attained in 80% of the patients 2 years after primary treatment with radiation therapy. There were 27 local recurrences, of which 82% were salvaged with surgery for an overall adjusted survival of 95%. Patients treated on 60Co units with field sizes less than or equal to 30 sq. cm had a 15% increase in local recurrence compared with field size greater than 30 sq. cm, which could not be attributed to lower doses. Poorly differentiated tumors and those involving the anterior commissure were more likely to develop a local recurrence. Doses above 1900 ret were associated with a decrease in local recurrence in patients having anterior commissure involvement. Salvage with limited surgery for failure was effective in selected cases

Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators

Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators

In all patients N-acetyl-aspartate signals were decreased in tumour areas compared to the normal brain hemisphere. No recovery was seen after radiotherapy. Choline signals were increased in tumour margins of high grade gliomas and more diffusely in low grade gliomas. In 5 patients the choline resonance decreased after radiotherapy, accompanied by a shrinkage of tumour diameter on MRI. Lactate signals were present in high grade and unspecified astrocytomas and absent in most low grade gliomas. In 3 patients the lactate signal disappeared after radiotherapy. These observations indicate the feasibility of 1H-MRS in monitoring metabolic responses on radiotherapy of brain gliomas

The purpose of this study was to use proton MR spectroscopy to investigate serial changes in recurrent malignant gliomas after gamma knife radiosurgery to characterize tissue response to high-dose radiation. METHODS: Eighteen patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with MR imaging and 3D proton MR spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery and at regular time points thereafter. Choline (Cho) and N-acetyl aspartate levels were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis and compared with levels found in normal tissue and with levels observed at previous time points. The results of the spectral analysis were then compared with the radiologic findings. Statistical comparisons were precluded by the small sample sizes involved. RESULTS: Response within the gamma knife target was observed as a reduction of Cho levels and an increase in lactate/lipid levels, typically within 6 months of treatment. Increases in Cho correlated with poor radiologic response and suggested tumor recurrence, confirmed histologically in six cases. The development of a spectral abnormality preceded a coincident increase in contrast enhancement by 1 to 2 months in nine cases. CONCLUSION: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging provided diagnostic and monitoring information before and after radiosurgery. Evaluation of metabolic changes with proton MR spectroscopy and structural changes with MR imaging improved tissue discrimination and provided correlation with histologic findings

METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. RESULTS: In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors

Some patients, however, develop adverse late effects following treatment and the purpose of this study was to determine which factors give rise to a poor local outcome. METHODS: The hospital records from a first cohort of 127 patients treated by protons from 1989 to 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. The presence of rubeosis was selected as a measure of significant ocular damage. Split file analysis was performed with 73 cases forming a test group with the remaining 54 cases acting as a validation group. RESULTS: Large tumour size and the presence of retinal detachment were significant, independent risk factors for developing rubeosis for both the test and validation groups. These factors also predicted subsequent enucleation for uncontrolled ocular pain. Patients with tumours too large to plaque and with an associated retinal detachment had a 90% chance of developing rubeosis within 4 years of proton beam radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a uveal melanoma too large for plaque therapy and an associated retinal detachment run a very high risk of developing rubeosis after proton beam radiotherapy and one third of individuals developing rubeosis required enucleation for pain even if local tumour control was satisfactory

This characteristic is known for charged particle beams. In a field study based on German cooperative trials, the possibility of a charged particle radiotherapy to retroperitoneal tumors of childhood will be discussed regarding indications in risk groups and recurrences. Absolute patient numbers are estimated from the clinical experiences and the incidences of the diseases. A stepwise introduction of this new therapy modality is proposed

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma

For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000).

Effects of 100 and 250 microM drugs were assessed after incubation of 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Irradiations were performed with 62 MeV therapeutic protons, delivering to the cell monolayer single doses of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 Gy. Viability was evaluated 7 days after irradiation. Inactivation level was estimated using microtetrasolium (MTT) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. Combined effects of each drug and protons, were carried out using the same drug concentrations. Proton doses applied were those used in therapy, that is, 12 and 16 Gy. With the increase of drug concentration or irradiation dose, level of cell inactivation reached approximately 60%, 48 h after drug treatment or 7 days after irradiation at 16 Gy. Considering the rate of drug concentrations used, as well as the level of doses applied, it appears that HTB140 cells are more resistant to proton irradiation than to alkylating agents tested. The combined treatment with FM or DTIC and protons did not show significant changes of cell viability as compared to the effects of single agents. Since the time point for measuring cumulative effects of drug and irradiation was 48 h post irradiation, it seems that the obtained level of viability could be attributed primarily to the effects of drugs

The results based on 84 treatments indicate that average monthly doses in the range 12-19 mrem can be expected for 30 daily treatments similar to those monitored. It was also found that 76% of the in-room dose was due to activated components in the treatment head, the balance of the in-room dose being due to activated concrete. Other statistics were obtained on patient in-room times and technologist times and doses outside the treatment room. Although the monthly film dosimetry records show no detectable doses for technologists working with these particular machines, in the spirit of ALARA, steps have been taken to reduce residual activities even further by choice of material less susceptible to activation

The latter was mainly a result of partial irradiation of pituitary adenoma. Some patients after proton irradiation demonstrated signs of adenohypophyseal functional insufficiency, more marked in patients with a decreased level of Gy (over 5 ng/ml). A conclusion is that proton beam therapy is effective (provided all criteria for patients' eligibility are observed) and can be used as an independent method for the treatment of acromegalic patients

This paper describes the results of our attempt to demonstrate short-term changes associated with normal brain during and immediately following radiotherapy when the whole brain is irradiated for malignant conditions. No observable changes were found in the normal brain parenchyma in any of the patients (n = 8) in T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted images in the sequential scans in the first and second weeks and immediately following radiotherapy. Also, no changes were observed in the normal brain appearance at 2 mo (n = 6), up to 6 mo (n = 1), and up to 15 mo (n = 1) after completion of radiotherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The FOCAL unit is a combination of a linear accelerator (Linac), CT scanner, X-ray simulator (X-S), and carbon table, and is designed to achieve CT-guided SRT with daily CT positioning followed by immediate irradiation while patients keep reduced shallow respirations. To evaluate intrafractional tumor position stability, 50 lung or liver lesions in 20 patients were checked by repeated CT scanning just before and after irradiation, and the obtained images were compared. RESULTS: There was no case with the intrafractional error judged to be greater than 10 mm. In 68% of cases, the intrafractional positioning errors were negligible (0-5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Using the FOCAL unit, SRT for lung or liver cancers could be performed with intrafractional positioning errors not greater than 10 mm

High-resolution 3D T2-weighted fast spin echo (3D FSE) MRI scans were obtained for 60 consecutive ocular melanoma patients using a 1.5 T MRI (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), in a standard head coil. These patients were subsequently treated with proton beam therapy at the UC Davis Cyclotron, Davis, CA. The tumor was delineated by placement of tantalum rings (radio-opaque markers) around the tumor periphery as defined by pupillary transillumination during surgery. A point light source, placed against the sclera, was also used to confirm ring agreement with indirect ophthalmoscopy. When necessary, intraoperative ultrasound was also performed. The patients were planned using EYEPLAN software and the tumor volumes were obtained. For analysis, the tumors were divided into four categories based on tumor height and basal diameter. In order to assess the impact of high-resolution 3D T2 FSE MRI, the tumor volumes were outlined on the MRI scans by two independent observers and the tumor volumes calculated for each patient. Six (10%) of 60 patients had tumors, which were not visible on 3D MRI images. These six patients had tumors with tumor heights < or = 3 mm. A small intraobserver variation with a mean of (-0.22 +/- 4)% was seen in tumor volumes delineated by 3D T2 FSE MR images. The ratio of tumor volumes measured on MRI to EYEPLAN for the largest to the smallest tumor volumes varied between 0.993 and 1.02 for 54 patients. The tumor volumes measured directly on 3D T2 FSE MRI ranged from 4.03 to 0.075 cm3. with a mean of 0.87 +/- 0.84 cm3. The tumor shapes obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images were comparable to the tumor shapes obtained using EYEPLAN software. The demonstration of intraocular tumor volumes with the high-resolution 3D fast spin echo T2 weighted MRI is excellent and provides additional information on tumor shape. We found a high degree of accuracy for tumor volumes with direct MRI volumetric measurements in uveal melanoma patients. In some patients with extra large tumors, the tumor base and shape was modified, because of the additional information obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images

The majority received 30 Gy of 3 MeV electrons in 12 treatments over three weeks. Eighty-eight patients had received prior therapy. Fifty patients had cutaneous plaques only (T1-2N0), and 56 had more advanced disease. At five years, actuarial survival is 66.7% and disease-free survival 21.4%. The median time to relapse is 12 months; prolonged survival is seen only with complete response. Compared with more advanced stages, T1-2N0 patients have more frequent complete response (96% vs 71%) and better relapse-free survival at five years (32 vs 7%). Of 14 patients with T2 disease in continuous complete remission for from 45-113 months, only one has relapsed. This suggests that cure is possible in up to 26% of patients with T2 disease who achieve complete response. In advanced stages, complete response is more likely with doses over 25 Gy (80 vs 50%). First recurrences were predominently in sites of previous involvement. Death resulted mainly from extracutaneous dissemination or failure to induce remission

Even after complete surgical resection, local relapses are frequent. Postoperative radiotherapy is therefore usually indicated. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a new technique that helps creating dose distributions that conform closely to the target volume while maximally sparing the organs at risk. This results in the possibility of applying escalated doses to the target while still keeping the incidence of side effects low. What is especially appealing is the possibility of shaping the dose distribution within the target in such a way that areas with a presumably high tumor cell load receive increased doses, a concept which is best described by the term "integrated boost". We present the case of a patient with a sinunasal carcinoma and describe the implications of the clinical implementation of this technique

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization

The purpose is to deliver a large single dose to the surgically exposed tumor bed while minimizing doses to normal tissues. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is a technique which allows irradiating the patient directly after the surgical operation using a linear accelerator that can be situated in the operating room. For medical accelerators with energy over 10MeV the need to characterize the neutron spectra for this particular situation arises from the fact that, when neutron spectra is not fully known, it becomes necessary to be more cautious introducing a weight factor wR of 20 (maximum value). This leads to overesteem the equivalent dose due to neutrons and it indicates to introduce additional (mobile) shields for photon and neutrons radiation not easily achievable in an operating room

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival	
1	1707	Conformal proton radiation treatment for retroperitoneal neuroblastoma: introduction of a novel technique	California, Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Humans, Liver, Male, Neuroblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome, Universities	BACKGROUND: Postoperative irradiation for locoregionally advanced neuroblastoma requires coverage of the paraspinal retroperitoneum. The proximity of both kidneys and the liver, and a more complex target configuration, can pose a dosimetric challenge for conventional X-ray treatment and intraoperative irradiation. We utilized proton radiation therapy (PRT) to reduce dose to uninvolved kidneys, liver, intestine, and spinal cord. PROCEDURE: A 4-year-old male underwent PRT for neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland, following chemotherapy and delayed surgical resection. Clinical target volume (CTV), boost volume, and normal structures were outlined on the 3D treatment planning CT scan. The patient received 25.2 CGE (cobalt Gray equivalent) to the CTV and 34.2 CGE to the boost region, using 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for target and nontarget structures. RESULTS: The 95% isodose volume enclosed CTV and boost volumes. The dose to 50% of the ipsilateral kidney, with tumor involvement of the medial renal surface, was < or = 16 CGE (47% of prescribed total dose). Doses to 50% and 20% of the contralateral kidney in close proximity to deep left-side, paraspinal soft tissue involvement were restricted to 1 CGE and 10 CGE, respectively. Eighty percent of the liver received 27 CGE (80% of prescribed dose). Using a patch technique, unique to charged particle therapy, the spinal cord was almost completely spared during boost volume irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: PRT can achieve excellent dose conformity for advanced retroperitoneal, paraspinal lesions, while respecting normal tissue tolerance levels. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients treated between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients presented with locally recurrent (n = 17), T2 (n = 20), high-grade (n = 26), or incompletely resected tumors (n = 11). All patients underwent limbsparing surgery and IORT (median dose of 15 Gy) given either with high-dose-rate brachytherapy or a linear accelerator. 25 patients received additional EBRT with a mean of 50.6 Gy (range: 30.6-60 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-5.6 years). RESULTS: The 5-year overall and distant disease-free survival rates were 66% and 54%, respectively. The overall actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years is 16% (95% CI: 1%, 31%). The crude rate after 8 years is 18%. Surgical margin status, primary versus recurrent tumor and tumor stage did not show any statistically significant influence (univariate analysis) on local recurrence rates. Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas, IORT +/- EBRT after limb-preserving surgery achieves high local control rates. The risk of normal tissue toxicities is comparable to conventional limb-sparing treatment

Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas, IORT +/- EBRT after limb-preserving surgery achieves high local control rates. The risk of normal tissue toxicities is comparable to conventional limb-sparing treatment

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients treated between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients presented with locally recurrent (n = 17), T2 (n = 20), high-grade (n = 26), or incompletely resected tumors (n = 11). All patients underwent limbsparing surgery and IORT (median dose of 15 Gy) given either with high-dose-rate brachytherapy or a linear accelerator. 25 patients received additional EBRT with a mean of 50.6 Gy (range: 30.6-60 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-5.6 years). RESULTS: The 5-year overall and distant disease-free survival rates were 66% and 54%, respectively. The overall actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years is 16% (95% CI: 1%, 31%). The crude rate after 8 years is 18%. Surgical margin status, primary versus recurrent tumor and tumor stage did not show any statistically significant influence (univariate analysis) on local recurrence rates. Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed.

Target volumes are irradiated using sequential 1.68-cm-thick slices with the patient moved between each successive slice delivery. Due to the method of delivery, superficial doses from a course of intensity modulated radiation therapy may be significantly different from doses delivered with conventional radiation therapy. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the superficial depth-dose distribution for geometric target volumes. Treatment plans were conducted for 5-cm-diam, 5-cm-long right cylindrical target volumes embedded in a 16-cm-diam, 12-cm-long water-equivalent cylindrical phantom. Three experiments were conducted with centrally located, off-centered, and superficial targets. Doses at superficial depths were measured using 3 x 3 x 1 mm3 thermoluminescent dosimetry chips. For all three targets, the measured doses were slightly greater than the calculated doses. Doses measured in the buildup region for the superficial target indicated that bolus would be required to provide the prescribed dose at the phantom surface

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor was located in the parotid gland in 59%, submandibular gland in 14%, oral cavity in 23%, and elsewhere in 5%. In 386 of 498 patients surgery was combined with radiotherapy, with a median dose of 62 Gy. Median delay between surgery and radiotherapy was 6 weeks. In the postoperative radiotherapy group, adverse prognostic factors prevailed. Elective radiotherapy to the neck was given in 40%, with a median dose of 50 Gy. Primary radiotherapy (n = 40) was given for unresectable disease or M(1), with a dose range of 28-74 Gy. RESULTS: Postoperative radiotherapy improved 10-year local control significantly compared with surgery alone in T(3-4) tumors (84% vs. 18%), in patients with close (95% vs. 55%) and incomplete resection (82% vs. 44%), in bone invasion (86% vs. 54%), and perineural invasion (88% vs. 60%). Local control was not correlated with interval between surgery and radiotherapy. No dose-response relationship was shown. Postoperative radiotherapy significantly improved regional control in the pN(+) neck (86% vs. 62% for surgery alone). A rating scale for different sites, T stage, and histologic type may be applied to calculate the risk of disease in the neck at presentation, and so indicate the need for elective neck treatment. A marginal dose-response was seen, in favor of a dose > or =46 Gy. A clear dose-response relationship was shown for patients treated with primary radiotherapy. Five-year local control was 50% with a dose of 66-70 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative radiotherapy with a dose of at least 60 Gy is indicated for patients with T(3-4) tumors, incomplete or close resection, bone invasion, perineural invasion, and pN(+). In unresectable tumors, a dose of at least 66 Gy is advisable

The use of the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was found to be effective for the treatment of children with mild and average forms of ICD. Irradiation of the pituitary gland at a dose of 70-100 Gy is accompanied by general and local radiation reactions which are not dangerous for children. The time of development of remission after irradiation depends on a degree of severity and features of a course of disease

Other institutions may find information regarding field size and range requirements for this population of patients useful for designing new proton beamlines. The maximum range, range modulation, and maximum field radius for 240 fields of prostate patients undergoing treatment were sampled and analyzed. Most fields required a range less than 290 mm of water, a modulation width less than or equal to 120 mm, and a radius less than 75 mm

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 394 1H MR spectra were acquired from 100 patients (age 19-74 years; mean and median age, 43 years) before and during 2 years after radiation therapy (the mean absorbed doses calculated for the averaged spectroscopy voxels are similar and close to 20 Gy). RESULTS: Oscillations were observed in choline-containing compounds (Cho)/creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and center of gravity (CG) of the lipid band in the range of 0.7-1.5 ppm changes over time reveal oscillations. The parameters have the same 8-month cycle period; however the CG changes precede the other by 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the oscillative nature of the brain response to irradiation, which may be caused by the blood-brain barrier disruption and repair processes. These oscillations may influence the NMR results, depending on the cycle phase in which the NMR measurements are performed in. The earliest manifestation of radiation injury detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the CG shift

METHODS: We studied the effects of interstitial brachytherapy on the brains of healthy monkeys and in humans with glioblastoma multiforme. The effects of radiation therapy on normal brain tissue in monkeys were assessed with sequential proton MR spectroscopic studies 1 week to 6 months after brachytherapy. Proton MR spectroscopy was also performed in five patients with residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (three of whom had radiation necrosis after brachytherapy), seven patients with newly diagnosed untreated glioblastoma multiforme, and 16 healthy volunteers, who served as a control group. RESULTS: In monkeys, the ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr) and the ratio of choline-containing compounds (Cho) to Cr of the reference point were significantly lower 1 week after brachytherapy than before treatment. The ratio of NAA to Cho of the irradiated area tended to be higher 1 week after brachytherapy than before irradiation. These peak metabolic ratios showed characteristic changes 6 months after treatment. In two of three monkeys, lipid signal was elevated 6 months after irradiation. In the clinical study, the ratio of NAA to Cho in the area of radiation necrosis was significantly different from that in glioblastoma multiforme when compared with the contralateral hemisphere after irradiation. In addition, lipid signal was detected in all patients with radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: It might be possible to use proton MR spectroscopy to differentiate radiation necrosis from residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme on the basis of comparisons with the contralateral hemisphere after radiation therapy

To evaluate the applicability and technical performance of a commercial 3D surface imaging system for repositioning of breast cancer patients, measurements were performed in a rigid anthropomorphic phantom as well as in healthy volunteers. The camera system records a respiration-gated surface model of the imaged object, which may be registered to a previously recorded reference model. A transformation is provided, which may be applied to the treatment couch to correct the setup of the patient. The system showed a high stability and detected pre-defined shifts of phantoms and healthy volunteers with an accuracy of 0.40 +/- 0.26 mm and 1.02 +/- 0.51 mm, respectively (spatial deviation between pre-defined shift and suggested correction). The accuracy of the suggested rotational correction around the vertical axis was always better than 0.3 degrees in phantom measurements and 0.8 degrees in volunteers, respectively. Comparison of the suggested setup correction with that detected by a second and independently operated marker-based optical system provided consistent results. The results demonstrate that the camera system provides highly accurate setup corrections in a phantom and healthy volunteers. The most efficient use of the system for improving the setup accuracy in breast cancer patients has to be investigated in routine patient treatments

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients were randomized to pion therapy (33-34.5 Gy pi), or conventional photon irradiation (60 Gy). Entry criteria included astrocytoma (modified Kernohan high Grade 3 or Grade 4), age 18-70, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or = 50, ability to start irradiation within 30 days of surgery, unifocal tumor, and treatment volume < 850 cc. The high-dose volume in both arms was computed tomography enhancement plus a 2-cm margin. The study was designed with the power to detect a twofold difference between arms. RESULTS: Eighty-one eligible patients were equally balanced for all known prognostic variables. Pion patients started radiation 7 days earlier on average than photon patients, but other treatment-related variables did not differ. There were no significant differences for either early or late radiation toxicity between treatment arms. Actuarial survival analysis shows no differences in terms of time to local recurrence or overall survival where median survival was 10 months in both arms (p = 0.22). The physician-assessed KPS and patient-assessed quality of life (QOL) measurements were generally maintained within 10 percentage points until shortly before tumor recurrence. There was no apparent difference in the serial KPS or QOL scores between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: In contrast to high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy for central nervous system tumors, such as neutron or neon therapy, the safety of pion therapy, which is of intermediate LET, has been reaffirmed. However, this study has demonstrated no therapeutic gain for pion therapy of glioblastoma

CONCLUSION: In contrast to high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy for central nervous system tumors, such as neutron or neon therapy, the safety of pion therapy, which is of intermediate LET, has been reaffirmed. However, this study has demonstrated no therapeutic gain for pion therapy of glioblastoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52.3 years (14-85), were treated using 201 MeV proton beam of the centre de protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), 49 for a chordoma and 18 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented 2/3 of the total dose and protons 1/3. The median total dose delivered within gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 32 months (4-71), the 3-year local control rates were for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of 70.8% and 85.2%, respectively and 4-year overall survival rates of 87.7% and 75%, respectively. Fourteen tumours (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the gross tumor volume, four into the CTV and 2 in an unknown site). Seven patients died of tumour and one of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, age inferieur ou egal a 52.3 years (p = 0.002), maximum tumoral diameter < 44.7 mm (p = 0.02) and GTV < 28.4 mL (0.02), at time of radiotherapy, influenced positively the local control. According to multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. Only five (7.7%) patients presented grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In base of skull chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combined photon and proton therapy offers excellent chances of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

1	604	The potential of proton beam radiation therapy in lung cancer (including mesothelioma). [Review] [28 refs]	Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sweden	A Swedish group of oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that about 350 patients with lung cancer and about 20 patients with mesothelioma annually may benefit from proton beam therapy. [References: 28]

Common to all of these methods is the time-dependent change of certain accelerator parameters during radiation treatment. The accelerators for which these methods can be used are equipped with independent collimator jaws, however, not with any kind of multileaf collimation. This method was designed to deposit a certain group of dose distributions that are restricted by a small number of constraints. The developed methods were implemented into a digitally controlled medical linear accelerator and the dosimetric results of such treatments were evaluated. Dose distributions with spatial dependencies in one and in two dimensions were deposited by movement of one X-ray jaw pair. Furthermore, a method for generation of a two-dimensional rotationally symmetric dose distribution was developed

METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed

By revealing a decrease of the N-acetyl-aspartate/choline ratio in the pons, 1H MR spectroscopy anticipated lesions growth on MR imaging. In line with the results in four patients reported in the literature, our observation indicates that external radiation therapy is not effective for intracranial involvement in ECD

The irradiated cohort consisted of 167 patients treated at the Donner Pavilion (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley), and the comparison cohort was the population evaluated in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR). Survival analyses were performed comparing the two cohorts using three different sets of matching criteria, each more restrictive than the previous analyses. The three different strategies were (1) matched only on severity of diabetic retinopathy; (2) matched on severity of retinopathy and age; and (3) matched on severity of retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status. Tests of comparison were the log-rank test, the Wilcoxon test, and the likelihood ratio test. For the model matching only on severity of retinopathy, mean survival was 8.3 years for the WESDR group and 9.4 years for the ablated group (p > 0.05 for all three statistical tests). For the model matched on retinopathy and age, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 9.2 years for the ablated group (p=0.05 log-rank test, 0.32 Wilcoxon test, and 0.06 likelihood ratio test). For the model matching on retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 11.6 years for the ablated group (p=0.72 log-rank test, 0.08 Wilcoxon test, and 0.82 likelihood ratio test). These data are compatible with the notion that pituitary ablation, and therefore induced pituitary growth hormone deficiency, may not decrease survival in those with severe diabetic retinopathy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose plans of 6 stereotactically treated patients were recalculated for IMSRT by use of the same field setup and an inverse planning algorithm. Proton and IMPT plans were calculated anew. Three different tumor shapes, multifocal, ovoid, and irregular, were analyzed, as well as dose to organs-at-risk (OAR) in the vicinity of the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distributions were calculated from beam-setup data for a manual mMLC for stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy (SCRT), a dynamic mMLC for IMSRT, the spot-scanning technique for protons, and a modified spot-scanning technique for IMPT. SCRT was included for a part of the comparison. Criteria for assessment were PTV coverage, dose-volume histograms (DVH), volumes of specific isodoses, and the dose to OAR. RESULTS: Dose conformation to the PTV is equally good for all three techniques and tumor shapes considered. The volumes of the 90% and 80% isodose were comparable for all techniques. For the 50% isodose volume, a divergence between the two modes was seen. In 3 cases, this volume is smaller for IMSRT, and in the 3 other cases, it is smaller for IMPT. This difference was even more pronounced for the volumes of the 30% isodose; IMPT shows further improvement over conventional protons. OAR in concavities (e.g., the brainstem) were similarly well spared by protons and IMSRT. IMPT spares critical organs best. Fewer proton beams are required to achieve similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of intensity modulation improves the conformality of mMLC-based SCRT. Conformation of dose to the PTV is comparable for IMSRT, protons, and IMPT. Concerning the sparing of OAR, IMSRT is equivalent to IMPT, and IMPT is superior to conventional protons. The advantage of protons lies in the lower integral dose

For the calculation of the number of potential patients for hadron therapy so far, only epidemiological estimations on cancer incidence are available without inclusion of the percentage of patients routinely referred to conventional radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationwide prospective survey to collect disease and treatment related data on patients receiving conventional radiotherapy at all 12 treatment facilities. Epidemiological cancer incidence (Statistic Austria 1999) were correlated with the number of patients receiving conventional radiotherapy. Based on published clinical and experimental results on proton and carbon ion therapy, a calculation of patient's subgroups suitable for hadron therapy was performed at five European University hospitals involved in the HICAT, CNAO, ETOILE and MEDAustron project. Using the mean values of the University specific percentages per tumour site, the number of potential patients was estimated. RESULTS: In Austria, a total of 3783 patients started radiotherapy during the study period of 3 months resulting in an approximated number of 15132 patients per year. The number of potential patients was estimated to 2044 per year, representing 5.6% of all newly diagnosed cancer patients and 13.5% of all irradiated cancer patients. CONCLUSION: There is a clear place for a hadron therapy facility in Austria, based on pattern of care in radiotherapy, cancer incidence and indications

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and December 2002, 152 patients were treated at GSI with carbon ion RT. Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions. RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control was 81% for chordomas, 100% for chondrosarcomas, and 62% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas

1	2144	Change in radiosensitivity with fractionated-dose irradiation of carbon-ion beams in five different human cell lines	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cell Line, Cell Survival/ph [Physiology], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts/ph [Physiology], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiobiology, Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured/ph [Physiology], Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Tumor Stem Cell Assay, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To investigate the change in the surviving fractions by fractionated-dose irradiations with carbon ions, based on the recovery of potentially lethal damage (PLDR) and the change of radiosensitivity by every fractionated-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One normal human and four human-tumor cell lines were used. Cells were irradiated with carbon ions accelerated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan. The LET values were estimated to be 13.18 keV/microm for low-LET beams and 76.92 +/- 0.20 keV/microm for high-LET beams. Fractionated-dose irradiations were carried out with 5 fractions within a 24-h interval. RESULTS: The surviving fractions for the fractionated-dose irradiation with X-rays and carbon ions decreased exponentially with increasing the number of fractions in the tumor cell lines. In contrast, the surviving fractions for the carbon ions in normal human cells decreased exponentially as well as the tumor cell lines, while it tended to level off from the 3rd to the 5th fraction in the case of using X-rays. CONCLUSION: The change in both the recovery ratio of the PLDR and radiosensitivity by every fractionated-dose irradiation depends on individual cell lines and the quality of radiations

Of 562 eyes treated over a 10-year period with pretreatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better, 363 (64.6%) contained tumors within 2 disc diameters (DD) of the disc or fovea. Rates of visual loss after treatment to worse than 20/200 and causes of visual decline were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cumulative rates of visual loss among subjects with tumors near the disc or fovea were 33 and 47% 1 and 2 years after treatment compared to 17 and 28%, respectively, for subjects with tumors located farther from both structures. The leading cause of visual loss in the first year among eyes with tumors near the disc or fovea was retinal detachment. Controlling for other predictors of visual loss to worse than 20/200, location near the disc or fovea was independently related to visual loss primarily due to retinal detachment, cataract, and radiation retinopathy. Despite the unfavorable location of these tumors, over half of patients with 20/200 or better pretreatment visual acuity had useful vision 2 years after treatment

1	618	Transnasal endoscopic resection of lesions of the clivus: a preliminary report	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma/di [Diagnosis], Carcinoma/su [Surgery], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Head, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Meningioma/di [Diagnosis], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Neuroendoscopy/mt [Methods], Nose, Radiation, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	OBJECTIVE: To review our experience with transnasal endoscopic resection of clival lesions. BACKGROUND: Because of the surrounding vital structures and the difficulties in achieving wide surgical exposure, the treatment of clival lesions is challenging. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, many centers use facial incisions and osteotomies to approach clival lesions. Minimally invasive endoscopic techniques have the potential to minimize morbidity while yielding similar surgical results. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with tumors involving the clivus that underwent endoscopic resection between 2000 and 2004 were identified. Charts were reviewed for clinical characteristics, previous therapies, diagnosis, tumor extent, management modalities, length of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. There were four males and two females with a mean age of 50 years, ranging from 29 to 66 years. The most common presenting symptoms were visual disturbances. Three patients had prior craniotomy with subtotal tumor resection. The pathology included three clival chordomas, and one each of meningioma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. All patients were managed with computer-aided transnasal endoscopic tumor resection with neurosurgical standby or involvement. None of the patients required additional craniotomies. The mean follow-up was 13 (range, 8-24) months. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in three patients, and two patients are currently undergoing proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT). The average length of hospital stay was 2 (range, 2-3) days. There were no major postoperative complications. At the last follow-up, five patients were alive with two patients being free of disease. Two patients with residual disease are currently undergoing PBRT, and one patient developed distant metastasis. One patient died of unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report suggests that transnasal endoscopic management of clival lesions is a viable option to traditional open approaches with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The use of computer-aided surgery further minimizes surgical risks while maximizing tumor resection

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22). When BNCT is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA and radiobiological considerations, promising clinical results have been obtained, although many problems and issues remain to be solved

METHODS: Nine ependymoma patients have been treated with SRS (four with linear accelerator and five with Gamma Knife) since 1990. Two patients had WHO grade III tumors, and the remaining seven had WHO grade II tumors. Eight of nine patients received external beam radiation therapy at some point prior to radiosurgery to a total median dose of 54 Gy. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 14 to 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 35 years. Four patients developed progressive disease following radiosurgery, and two patients have died of progressive disease. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 55.6%. The 3-year overall survival was 71.1%. Patients treated with radiosurgery as a component of initial treatment (generally as a boost following external beam) had an improved relapse-free survival (100%) compared to those treated with radiosurgery to salvage an external beam local failure (20%). CONCLUSION: SRS is an effective treatment for intracranial ependymoma. Further clinical trials are warranted incorporating radiosurgery as a component of initial management in selected ependymoma patients

This study was to evaluate the correlation of GHR expression to radiosensitivity of rectal cancer. METHODS: The expression of GHR in biopsy specimens from 98 rectal cancer patients before preoperative irradiation and postoperative specimens was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Radiosensitivity was evaluated according to Rectal Cancer Regression Grading. RESULTS: IHC revealed that GHR overexpression was positively correlated to poor response to radiotherapy (P<0.001, rs=0.399); RT-PCR also showed that radiosensitivity was significantly higher in GHR mRNA-negative group than in GHR mRNA-positive group (P<0.001, rs=0.398). Compared with the biopsy specimens before preoperative irradiation, the paired postoperative specimens showed significantly increased GHR expression in residual cancer cells (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Detection of GHR expression before preoperative irradiation may predict radiosensitivity of rectal cancer

A phase-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence was used to determine the temperature-related phase shifts during LITT. Temperature maps were displayed during therapy with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. Irradiation was discontinued as soon as the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm reached the margin of the tumor. A contrast-enhanced MRI study performed immediately after therapy showed a good correlation of the size of an enhancing rim around the lesion with the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm. The preliminary results of our study indicate that MRI guidance of LITT may be improved by temperature quantification based on the proton-resonance-frequency method

CASE: A 28 year old white male sought help because of a conjunctival swelling. A biopsy made elsewhere had revealed a capillary haemangioma of the conjunctiva. Recently striking alterations of the skin led to the suspicion of a Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunohistochemical and dermatological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a Kaposi's sarcoma and viral testing of serum revealed an HIV-infection. Besides intensive antiviral therapy, our patient underwent local irradiation of the right eye, the nose and of the left shoulder with an external beam. CONCLUSIONS: Kaposi's sarcoma is the most frequent Aids-associated malignant tumor. In about 30% of all patients with Aids, a Kaposi's sarcoma is diagnosed. The angiomatous character may lead to the histopathological diagnosis of a haemangioma.Human herpes virus 8 is known to be the transforming element

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed analyzing all patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas who received radiotherapy through the University of California San Francisco and at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory between 1977 and 1987, a total of 62 patients. University of California San Francisco patients received photon therapy (median dose 5400 cGy), and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory patients were treated with the charged particles helium and/or neon (median dose 6000 cGyE). Forty-eight patients were treated post-operatively with curative intent, 30 with photons and 18 with particles. Thirty-six patients in the study had gross residual disease; none had microscopically negative margins. RESULTS: The overall two-year actuarial survival was 28%: 44% for particle-treated patients and 18% for patients treated with photons (p = .048). Median actuarial survival was 23 months in particle patients and 12 months in photon patients. Local control was also improved, though less significantly, in patients treated with particles (median disease-free survival 20 months vs. 4.5 months, p = .054). A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed and revealed that only extent of residual disease predicted local failure and overall survival; no other prognostic factors were identified. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional photon radiotherapy, treatment with post-operative charged particle irradiation at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory appeared to offer a survival advantage in this non-randomized series. Additional investigation into protection of surrounding normal tissue with better dose localization through the use of charged particles is planned

1	716	Dosimetric impact of geometric errors due to respiratory motion prediction on dynamic multileaf collimator-based four-dimensional radiation delivery	Fluoroscopy, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Theoretical, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Time Factors	The synchronization of dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) response with respiratory motion is critical to ensure the accuracy of DMLC-based four dimensional (4D) radiation delivery. In practice, however, a finite time delay (response time) between the acquisition of tumor position and multileaf collimator response necessitates predictive models of respiratory tumor motion to synchronize radiation delivery. Predicting a complex process such as respiratory motion introduces geometric errors, which have been reported in several publications. However, the dosimetric effect of such errors on 4D radiation delivery has not yet been investigated. Thus, our aim in this work was to quantify the dosimetric effects of geometric error due to prediction under several different conditions. Conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for a lung patient were generated for anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beam arrangements at 6 and 18 MV energies to provide planned dose distributions. Respiratory motion data was obtained from 60 diaphragm-motion fluoroscopy recordings from five patients. A linear adaptive filter was employed to predict the tumor position. The geometric error of prediction was defined as the absolute difference between predicted and actual positions at each diaphragm position. Distributions of geometric error of prediction were obtained for all of the respiratory motion data. Planned dose distributions were then convolved with distributions for the geometric error of prediction to obtain convolved dose distributions. The dosimetric effect of such geometric errors was determined as a function of several variables: response time (0-0.6 s), beam energy (6/18 MV), treatment delivery (3D/4D), treatment type (conformal/IMRT), beam direction (AP/PA), and breathing training type (free breathing/audio instruction/visual feedback). Dose difference and distance-to-agreement analysis was employed to quantify results. Based on our data, the dosimetric impact of prediction (a) increased with response time, (b) was larger for 3D radiation therapy as compared with 4D radiation therapy, (c) was relatively insensitive to change in beam energy and beam direction, (d) was greater for IMRT distributions as compared with conformal distributions, (e) was smaller than the dosimetric impact of latency, and (f) was greatest for respiration motion with audio instructions, followed by visual feedback and free breathing. Geometric errors of prediction that occur during 4D radiation delivery introduce dosimetric errors that are dependent on several factors, such as response time, treatment-delivery type, and beam energy. Even for relatively small response times of 0.6 s into the future, dosimetric errors due to prediction could approach delivery errors when respiratory motion is not accounted for at all. To reduce the dosimetric impact, better predictive models and/or shorter response times are required

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with acoustic neuromas deemed clinically suitable for linear accelerator or Gamma Knife radiosurgery were planned such that the minimum doses for any plan were equal. Gamma Knife plans were prepared in three ways: by altering the prescription of previously published data, by hand and with the assistance of an automatic planning algorithm (wizard). The linear accelerator plans were prepared utilizing a micro-multileaf collimator in both static and dynamic modes. The dose volume histogram analyses lead to a measure of conformity and the mean and minimum target dose for each plan. Statistical significance was calculated as each planning modality was compared with every other. RESULTS: All Gamma Knife plans demonstrated a statistically significantly better conformity when compared with fixed field linear accelerator techniques. When compared to linear accelerator techniques the wizard-assisted Gamma Knife plans demonstrated significantly better conformity. The mean target dose for all the Gamma Knife plans was significantly higher than that of the linear accelerator plans (19.2 Gy vs. 13.4 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: Conformity of the prescription isodose to the target shape is of major importance in radiosurgery. The modalities compared represent commercially available and widely accepted systems. Gamma Knife plans derived using the 'wizard' option and finalized by hand yield the best conformity. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel

After an apparent failure of the tumor to respond, the eye was enucleated. A predominantly epithelioid cell tumor appeared viable by light microscopy, and a low degree of mitotic activity persisted, despite therapy. The tumor cells, however, displayed degenerative changes ultrastructurally, presumably results of the radiotherapy. These consisted of numerous cytoskeletal filaments, lipid vacuoles, prominent phagolysosomes, and nuclear convolutions and fragmentations. The mitochondria were fewer in number in the present tumor than typically encountered in epithelioid cells. A rare leptomeric structure was discovered, probably an organizational modification of the cytoplasmic filaments. The tumor's capillaries showed radiation-induced changes in terms of thickened basement membranes and perivascular fibrin deposition. The foregoing features are indicative of cellular and metabolic injury from the radiotherapy, but these were evidently not sufficiently injurious to sterilize the tumor

The indications for double-dose irradiation with the same radio-element corresponded to "macroscopically abnormal" situations: immediate and prolonged radioresistance, recurrence or secondary radioresistance. Thirteen cases are called series 1 (Ruthenium) and 6 cases are called series 2 (protons). The series 1 allows a more reliable study as far as follow-up is higher (5.8 to 7.5 years) than in series 2 where the follow-up is shorter (13.6 to 29 months). Although double-dose irradiation was macroscopically efficient in 11 out of 13 cases in series 1, and in 3 out of 6 cases in series 2 (stabilization or decrease of tumour height measured before the second therapeutic session), 2 patients are deceased and 1 has a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of Ruthenium serie. Another one has also a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of protons series. Nevertheless double-dose radiotherapy allows a complementary decrease or stabilization of tumour height after a first session.

METHODS: Blood from 4 healthy donors was irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays and the dose response of induced micronuclei in binucleate lymphocytes following cytokinesis block was determined. Micronucleus frequency was ascertained before and at intervals during radiotherapy treatment in 6 patients with various tumors in the pelvic region. Equivalent whole body doses (physical doses) at these times were calculated from radiation treatment plans and cumulative dose volume histograms. RESULTS: Linear dose response relationships were found for induced micronucleus frequency in lymphocytes resulting from both in-vitro and in-vivo irradiation. Doses resulting from in-vivo irradiation (biological doses) were estimated by substitution of micronucleus frequency observed in radiotherapy patients into the dose response curve from in-vitro irradiation of blood. The relationship between the biologically estimated dose (BD) and the calculated equivalent whole body dose (PD) was BD = 0.868 (+/- 0.043)PD + 0.117 (+/- 0.075). CONCLUSION: The micronucleus assay appears to offer a reliable and consistent method for equivalent whole body radiation dose estimation, although our findings should be confirmed using lymphocytes from radiotherapy patients with tumors at anatomical sites other than the pelvis. Except at doses lower than about ).4 Gy, the method yields dose estimates acceptably close to "true" physically determined doses. The assay can be performed relatively rapidly and can be used as a "first line" biological dosimeter in situations where accidental exposure to relatively high radiation doses has occurred

The median clinical target volume was 546 cm(3). The applied carbon ion dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 GyE (gray equivalent, median 70.4) in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 9 to 87 months), 26 patients were still alive and 24 patients remained continuously disease-free. Overall and cause-specific survival rates at 5 years were 52 and 94%, respectively. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 96%. Two patients experienced severe skin/soft tissue complications requiring skin grafts. No other treatment-related surgical interventions, including colostomy or urinary diversion, were carried out. All patients have remained ambulatory and able to stay at home after carbon ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy is effective and safe in the management of patients with unresectable sacral chordomas and offers a promising alternative to surgery

Prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck is a criterion of treatment for these patients. But some authors suggest to prophylactically irradiate the the whole neck. This study was to analyze and compare long-term outcomes of the N0-NPC patients treated by prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck and to the whole neck, and explore radiotherapy on neck for N0-NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 178 N0-NPC patients, proved by pathology, were treated in our hospital from Jul. 1998 to Dec. 1999. Of the 178 patients, 88 received prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck (upper neck group), 90 received prophylactic irradiation to the whole neck (whole neck group). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze and compare survival rate of the 2 groups. Cox model was used to study prognostic factors of N0-NPC. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 90.9%, and 80.7% in upper neck group, and 97.8%, 80.0%, and 71.1% in whole neck group (P = 0.224). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 93.2%, 80.7%, and 77.3% in upper neck group, and 85.6%, 68.9%, and 64.4% in whole neck group (P = 0.163). The incidence of cervical lymph nodes recurrence was 1.14% in upper neck group, and 1.09% in whole neck group (P> 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, and short-term outcome were independent prognostic factors of N0-NPC. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic irradiation to upper neck is recommended for N0-NPC patients

A long-term dose-searching clinical trial protocol has been developed and we have followed more than 250 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, radiation doses ranged from 45 to 35 GyE, and now doses of 25, 20, 15 and, under special circumstances, 10 GyE, depending on a number of factors, are being evaluated. The characteristics of charged-particle beams provide a relatively homogeneous dose distribution with the 90% isodose contour to the periphery of the lesion. When the entire arterial phase of the AVM core is included in the treatment field, the rates for complete obliteration 3 years after treatment are: 90-95% for volumes less than or equal to 4 cm3; 90-95% for volumes greater than 4 and less than or equal to 14 cm3; and 60-70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3. The total obliteration rate for all volumes up to 70 cm3 is approximately 80-85%. For complete radiation-induced obliteration there is a relationship of dose and volume primarily, and location secondarily. Results on relationships between dose, AVM obliteration, and complications and sequelae of the radiosurgical procedure are presented and discussed

Diagnosis, localization and therapy were done immobilizing the head for identical positioning. In a controlled study the therapy was done with fractionated irradiation up to 50 Gy in 25 fractions within 5 weeks or with 20 Gy in 4 fractions within 7 days. Complications, due to therapy, did not occur. Suffering from convulsion was not affected. Five patients have died, one patient got a hemorrhage 36 months later. The angiographical analysis of the first 25 patients until 30 months after radiotherapy gave complete obliterations and reduction of volume in more than 50% with minor AVM's. The result are not detrimental compared with a group after photon irradiation

A 74-year-old patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago and started on the endocrine therapy with LH-RH agonist. He had no apparent distant metastasis, and received radiation therapy 8 years ago. He has complained of low back pain since several months ago. A high uptake on bone scintigram and osteolytic and osteoblastic damages on CT were noted in pubic bone and sacrum. The PSA level was less than 0.2 ng/ml. Pathohistological diagnosis by biopsy of the pubic bone was chondroblastic type osteosarcoma, showing an atypical cell proliferation with osteoid. Immunostaining for nonepithelial marker vimentin was positive. He underwent heavy ion radiation therapy for osteosarcoma at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. RESULTS: At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum. With the use of small-angle lateral-oblique fields in 3D-CPT and IMPT, the rectal V70 was reduced by up to 35% compared with the standard lateral configuration, whereas the bladder V70 increased by less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In the range higher than 60 Gy/CGE, IMRT achieved significantly better sparing of the bladder, whereas rectal sparing was similar with 3D-CPT and IMRT. Dose to healthy tissues in the range lower than 50% of the target prescription was substantially lower with proton therapy

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

Our aim was to measure the scattered dose to the contralateral breast, thyroid and gonads during radiation therapy after conservative breast surgery. Thermoluminescent dosimeters, LiF Mn Ti (3 x 3 x 0.9 mm3), were used to measure scattered radiations outside the treated area. They were positioned on the skin of the patients in small (2 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick) perspex holders. Each measurement was performed once per treatment and six dosimeters were used--two on the contralateral breast, one on the midpoint of the medial side and one on the midpoint of the lateral side; two on thyroid lobes and two on the pelvis. The minimum dose to the contralateral breast (p < 0.002) and the maximum dose to the gonads (p < 0.003) were significantly higher in the 60Co group than in the LINAC6 group. The mean values of the minimum doses to the contralateral breast were significantly different (p < 0.007) in the whole series when beam area values were lower or higher than the median value (176 cm2). In the whole series the beam area and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast were correlated (Pearson, p < 0.001); the beam area and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast (p < 0.005), the gantry angle for the lateral beam and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast (Spearman, p < 0.001) exhibited statistically significant correlations. Of 30 patients, 16 were irradiated with 60Co (group A) and 14 with LINAC6 (group B). In group A the average scattered dose to the contralateral breast ranged 0.53-2.15 Gy, 0.66-1.91 Gy in the thyroid, 0.14-0.19 Gy in the gonads. In group B the average scattered dose to the contralateral breast ranged 0.36-2.07 Gy, 0.53-0.98 Gy in the thyroid and 0.08-0.12 Gy in the gonads. In the LINAC6 group the beam area and the minimum dose to the thyroid exhibited a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.009), as well as the beam area and the maximum dose to the gonads (p < 0.006), the beam area and the minimum dose to the gonads (p < 0.02), the gantry angle of the lateral beam and the minimum dose to the contralateral breast (p < 0.02). In the 60Co group no correlation was statistically significant, except for the correlation between the beam area and the minimum dose to the gonads (p < 0.001). Our experience confirms the scattered dose to depend on head treatment, beam area, gantry angle and wedge angle. Finally, the literature on this subject is reviewed

Gamma-ray radiation was used for comparison. The results of standard colony formation assay showed that the survival fraction of each cell line decreased in an LET-dependent manner. The results of other direct cytotoxic assays, dye exclusion test, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, also displayed a similar relationship between the cytotoxic effect of carbon beams and LET. The maximum values of the cell death index (CDI) were 50.2% in A172 and 37.5% in TK1, both obtained on day 7 after exposure to carbon beams of 80 keV/microm. Apoptosis was observed only on days 4 and 7 after carbon beam irradiation, with maximum values of 7% in A172 and 4.5% in TK1, and the induction of apoptosis after high-LET radiation could be p53-independent. This indicated that a combination of multiple assays to detect cell death was important in evaluating the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, because this approach could more precisely reflect the clinical effectiveness of radiotherapy

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Harvard Medical School, Boston. PATIENTS: From 1991 to 2002, 23 patients with newly diagnosed adenoid cystic carcinoma with skull base extension were treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy. There was tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus in 61% of patients (14), nasopharynx in 61% (14), clivus in 48% (11), and cavernous sinus in 74% (17). The extent of surgery was biopsy alone in 48% (11), partial resection in 39% (9), and gross total resection with positive margins in 13% (3). The median total dose to the primary site was 75.9 cobalt-gray equivalent. The median follow-up of all surviving patients was 64 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Locoregional control and disease-free survival and overall survival rates. RESULTS: Tumors recurred locally in 2 patients at 33 and 68 months, respectively. No patients developed neck recurrence. Eight patients had distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence. The local control rate at 5 years was 93%. The rate of freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years was 62%. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 5 years were 56% and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant adverse factors predictive for overall survival were change in vision at presentation (P = .02) and involvement of sphenoid sinus and clivus (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose conformal proton beam radiation therapy results in a very encouraging local control rate in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the skull base. Changes in vision at presentation and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus and clivus are important prognostic factors

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Harvard Medical School, Boston. PATIENTS: From 1991 to 2002, 23 patients with newly diagnosed adenoid cystic carcinoma with skull base extension were treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy. There was tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus in 61% of patients (14), nasopharynx in 61% (14), clivus in 48% (11), and cavernous sinus in 74% (17). The extent of surgery was biopsy alone in 48% (11), partial resection in 39% (9), and gross total resection with positive margins in 13% (3). The median total dose to the primary site was 75.9 cobalt-gray equivalent. The median follow-up of all surviving patients was 64 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Locoregional control and disease-free survival and overall survival rates. RESULTS: Tumors recurred locally in 2 patients at 33 and 68 months, respectively. No patients developed neck recurrence. Eight patients had distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence. The local control rate at 5 years was 93%. The rate of freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years was 62%. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 5 years were 56% and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant adverse factors predictive for overall survival were change in vision at presentation (P = .02) and involvement of sphenoid sinus and clivus (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose conformal proton beam radiation therapy results in a very encouraging local control rate in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the skull base. Changes in vision at presentation and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus and clivus are important prognostic factors

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

Autopsy findings in 15 of these patients are reported. Ten patients received pituitary radiation (average dose, 116 Gy in six fractions) for progressive neovascularization retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus. Evidence of a time-dependent course of progressive fibrosis in their pituitary glands was found. Five patients were treated for eosinophilic adenomas. Although they had lower average doses of radiation (56 Gy in six fractions), their pituitary glands showed cystic cavitation of the adenomas. The adenomas thus appeared more radiosensitive than the normal pars anterior, which, in turn, was more radiosensitive than the adjacent neurohypophysis. No significant radiation changes were found in the surrounding brain or cranial nerves. The endocrine organs under pituitary control showed varying degrees of atrophy, and clinical tests revealed progressive hypofunction. It was concluded that charged-particle therapy produced a sharply delineated focal radiation lesion confined to the pituitary gland but did not cause injury to the critical structures of the surrounding central nervous system

The prognostic significance of tumor grading and pelvic node involvement was analyzed. Five and 10-year survival for Stage B was 100% and 85% respectively; for Stage C it was 68% and 43% respectively. The cumulative 94% local control rate for Stage B and C cases obtained in this report suggests more effectiveness to control the disease locally with acceptable rate of complications, when radioactive gold seed implant is added

This paper will discuss proton treatment in general, treatment planning procedures, and results to date in major patient categories. 846 patients have been treated with fractionated proton therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron, with normal tissue and tumor responses consistent with an RBE of 1.1 for the proton beam. Proton beam therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with uveal melanomas, and chordomas and chondrosarcomas involving the skull base and cervical spine. Improved dose distribution possible with protons have allowed greater doses than are given conventionally to be delivered to patients with prostatic carcinoma, head and neck malignancies, ano-rectal cancers, and retroperitoneal tumors. Doses employed have been usually 10 to 20% greater than normally would be delivered in our department to such tumors. Generally, local control rates have been good

Neutrons are clinically used to a larger extent already, protons occasionally. The physical characteristics of pi-meson beams are especially favorable. Even considerable ameliorations, however, of the percentage of local healing would increase the survival rate by some few per-cent only

In this series, the 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 41% with a 5-year crude survival rate of 36%. The results are analyzed according to tumour presentation and tumour doses. Six of 15 patients with tumours larger than 6 cm have had a lasting locoregional control. During the same period 43 other patients received radiotherapy as a post-operative modality. Results obtained in this group confirm the previously published data. While recent studies tend to demonstrate the specific efficacy of high LET radiation in the management of locally advanced salivary gland tumours, radical conventional radiotherapy can still be employed with a curative intent when neutron facilities are not available

Fifty-two out of 249 patients accepted for pion treatment by the end of 1986 were treated for malignant glioma with high dose pion irradiation. A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients between 1990 and 2005 with the diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancer was performed. Of 125 total patients new onset urothelial carcinoma developed in 11 after undergoing external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy with a proton boost to the prostate was the radiation modality in 7 of the 11 patients (64%), while the remaining 4 patients received standard external beam radiation only. Urothelial carcinoma was detected a mean of 3.07 years after completion of radiation therapy in the proton group, compared to a mean latency period of 5.75 years in the standard radiation group (p = 0.09). Average patient age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 64 to 84). All patients presented with gross hematuria and had cystoscopic findings of coexisting radiation cystitis. Of the 11 patients 5 (45%) presented with grade 3 carcinoma and eventually 7 (64%) required radical cystectomy. Urothelial tumors with sarcomatoid features (carcinosarcoma and spindle cell sarcomatoid) developed in 2 patients (18%). Of the 11 patients 10 (91%) were nonsmokers at the time of urothelial carcinoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma in patients with previous radiation therapy for prostate cancer is often high grade, and the majority of patients have cancer progression requiring cystectomy. A high incidence of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features was seen in these patients

METHODS: We treated 54 eyes of 53 patients with choroidal hemangioma. The lesions consisted of 48 circumscribed hemangiomas and six diffuse hemangiomas in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. The total applied dose was 27.3 Gy in four eyes, 22.7 Gy in three eyes, and 16.4 Gy to 18.2 Gy in 47 eyes. RESULTS: The retina reattached within six months after treatment in all 54 eyes and no recurrence of the secondary retinal detachment occurred within the follow-up period of 6 months to 9 years. Tumors treated with the higher doses regressed faster than tumors treated with the lower doses, but radiation-induced complications of the optic nerve appeared in all four eyes treated with a total dose of 27.3 Gy. Of 31 eyes treated with 16.4 to 18.2 Gy and followed for more than 1 year, 22 had an improvement in their visual acuity, and nine retained the same visual acuity. At the last follow-up examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in nine eyes, 20/40 to 20/25 in 13 eyes, 20/100 to 20/50 in six eyes, and 20/200 or less in three eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal hemangiomas appears to be a valid therapeutic alternative. A total proton dose ranging from 16.4 to 18.2 Gy applied in four daily fractions seems adequate to ensure local control of both tumor and secondary retinal detachment

The most effective approaches to therapy of oropharyngeal tumors with account of their site, spread and degrees of differentiation were developed. The most effective method was shown to be the combination of gamma-beam therapy (50 Gy) with electron-photon radiation (20 Gy) of an accelerator of 18-20 MeV, radiation exposure of normal tissues being lowered by approximately 10-20% as compared to that in gamma-beam therapy used alone. The use of the above method in 45 oropharyngeal cancer patients resulted in an immediate clinical effect (disappearance of a tumor and regional metastases (if any) in 60% of the patients.

In 281 patients with Stage IB tumors, the total incidence of pelvic failure was 6.4% (two without and 16 combined with distant metastasis). In 88 patients with Stage IIA, 12.5% failed in the pelvis (one without and ten combined with distant metastasis). The total pelvic failure rate in Stage IIB was 17.4% (22 without and 22 combined with distant metastasis). In 212 patients with Stage III, the overall pelvic failure rate was 35.8% (31 without and 45 combined with distant metastasis). Approximately 25% of the pelvic recurrences were central (cervix or vagina) and 75% parametrial. The overall incidence of distant metastasis was 13.5% for Stage IB, 27.3% for Stage IIA, 23.8% for Stage IIB, and 39.6% in Stage III. Higher doses of irradiation delivered to the medial and lateral parametrium with external beam irradiation and intracavitary insertions were correlated with a lower incidence of parametrial failures in all stages, except IB. In Stage IIA, medial parametrial doses below 9000 rad resulted in 10/78 = 12.8% pelvic failures, in contrast to one recurrence in 10 patients treated with doses over 9000 rad. In Stage IIB, doses below 9000 rad yielded a pelvic recurrence rate of 36/203 (17.7%) compared to 5/49 (10.2%) with higher doses. In Stage III there were 66/167 (39.5%) recurrences with doses below 9000 rad and 10/44 (22.7%) with larger doses. Statistically significant differences were observed among the Stage IIB (P = 0.02) and III patients (P = 0.005) respectively. The lateral parametrial dose also showed some correlation with tumor control, although the differences were not statistically significant. The survival in patients with Stage IIB and III was 10% higher in the patients treated with higher parametrial doses. However, the differences are not statistically significant. These results strongly suggest that higher doses of irradiation must be delivered to patients with Stage IIB and III, but improvement in tumor control must be weighed against an increasing number of complications. Factors other than the total doses of irradiation, such as the characteristics of the tumor and the quality of the intracavitary insertion influence the therapeutic results in irradiation of carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Other therapeutic approaches must be designed to improve the effect of irradiation in the tumor without further injury to the normal tissues. Hypoxic cell sensitizers, hyperthermia and high LET particles are under investigation

METHODS: Data from a cohort of patients with uveal melanoma treated by proton beam irradiation between 1991 and 1994 were analysed. The presence of inflammation was recorded and evaluated. Kaplan-Meier estimates and statistical analysis of general and tumour related risk factors were performed. RESULTS: 28% of patients treated during this period presented with ocular inflammation (median follow up 62 months). Risks factors were essentially tumour related and were correlated with larger lesions (height > 5 mm, diameter > 12 mm, volume > 0.4 cm(3)). Multivariate analysis identified initial tumour height and irradiation of a large volume of the eye as the two most important risk factors. Ocular inflammation usually consisted of mild anterior uveitis, resolving rapidly after topical steroids and cycloplegics. The incidence of inflammation after proton beam irradiation of melanomas seems higher than previously reported and is related to larger lesions. Evidence of inflammation associated with uveal melanoma has been described and seems to be associated with tumour necrosis (spontaneous or after irradiation). The appearance of transient inflammation during the follow up of these patients may be related to the release of inflammatory cytokines during tumour necrosis. CONCLUSION: Inflammation following proton beam irradiation is not unusual. It is correlated with larger initial tumours and may be related to tumour necrosis

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

1	4215	Importance of precise positioning for proton beam therapy in the base of skull and cervical spine	Adult, Boston, Brain, Brain Stem, Cervical Vertebrae, Child, Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Lobe, Uncertainty, X-Rays	Using proton beam therapy, high doses have been delivered to chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Dose inhomogeneity to the tumors has been accepted in order to maintain normal tissue tolerances, and detailed attention to patient immobilization and to precise positioning has minimized the margins necessary to ensure these dose constraints. This study examined the contribution of precise positioning to the better dose localization achieved in these treatments. Three patients whose tumors represented different anatomic geometries were studied. Treatment plans were developed which treated as much of the tumor as possible to 74 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) while maintaining the central brain stem and central spinal cord at less than or equal to 48 CGE, the surface of the brain stem, surface of the spinal cord, and optic structures at less than or equal to 60 CGE, and the temporal lobes at less than or equal to 5% likelihood of complication using a biophysical model of normal tissue complication probability. Two positioning accuracies were assumed: 3 mm and 10 mm. Both proton beam plans and 10 MV X ray beam plans were developed with these assumptions and dose constraints. In all cases with the same positioning uncertainties, the proton beam plans delivered more dose to a larger percentage of the tumor volume and the estimated tumor control probability was higher than with the X ray plans. However, without precise positioning both the proton plans and the X ray plans deteriorated, with a 12% to 25% decrease in estimated tumor control probability. In all but one case, the difference between protons with good positioning and poor positioning was greater than the difference between protons and X rays, both with good positioning. Hence in treating these tumors, which are in close proximity to critical normal tissues, attention to immobilization and precise positioning is essential. With good positioning, proton beam therapy permits higher doses to significantly more of the tumor in these sites than do X rays

Twenty-three patients were treated definitively with charged particles, 13 patients were treated with photons and particles, and 9 patients were treated for recurrent disease. Total doses ranged from 36 to 80 Gray equivalent (GyE). Thirty-three patients are alive with a minimum followup of 1 year. The actuarial survival and local control for all patients at 5 years is 62% and 59%, respectively. Patients treated for primary disease had a 78% actuarial local control rate at 2 years, whereas the rate for patients with recurrent disease was 33%. Patients with smaller visible tumor volumes (less than 20 cc) had a significantly better local control rate than patients with larger tumor volumes (80% vs 33% actuarial rate at 5 years). Patients with chondrosarcoma had the highest local control rate, as did patients treated with particles alone. Complications included 3 patients with unilateral visual loss, two patients who became blind, and 4 patients with radiation injury to the brainstem

In the case of proton therapy, secondary neutrons generated in the accelerator head and inside the patient reach many areas in the patient body. Due to the improved efficacy of management of cancer patients, the number of long term survivors post-radiation treatment is increasing substantially. This results in concern about the risk of radiation-induced cancer appearing at late post-treatment times. This paper presents a case study to determine the effective dose from secondary neutrons in patients undergoing proton treatment. A whole-body patient model, VIP-Man, was employed as the patient model. The geometry dataset generated from studies made on VIP-Man was implemented into the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code. Two proton treatment plans for tumours in the lung and paranasal sinus were simulated. The organ doses and ICRP-60 radiation and tissue weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. Results show whole body effective doses for the two proton plans of 0.162 Sv and 0.0266 Sv, respectively, to which the major contributor is due to neutrons from the proton treatment nozzle. There is a substantial difference among organs depending on the treatment site

These reactions may have acute or late character, may affect all structures of the hearing organ, and result in conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. Up to 40% of patients have acute middle ear side effects during radical irradiation including acoustic structures and about one-third of patients develop late sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Total radiotherapy dose and tumour site seem to be among the most important factors associated with the risk of hearing impairment. Thus, reduction in radiation dose to the auditory structures should be attempted whenever possible. New radiotherapy techniques (3-dimensional conformal irradiation, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) allow better dose distribution with lower dose to the non-target organs. Treatment of acute and late external otitis is mainly conservative and includes the anti-inflammatory agents (applied topically and systematically). Post-radiation chronic otitis media and the eustachian tube pathology may be managed with tympanic membrane incision with insertion of a tympanostomy tube (grommet), although the benefit of such approach is controversial and some authors advocate a more conservative approach. In these patients the functional deficit can be alleviated by application of bone conduction hearing aids such as, e.g., the bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA). There is no standard therapy for post-irradiation sudden or progressive SNHL yet corticosteroid therapy, rheologic medications, hyperbaric oxygen or carbogen therapy are usually employed (as for idiopathic SNHL), although controversial data on the efficacy of these treatment modalities have been published. In selected cases with bilateral profound hearing loss or total deafness, cochlear implants may prove effective. Further improvements in radiotherapy techniques and progress in otologic diagnostics and therapy may allow better prevention and management of radiation-related acoustic injury. [References: 126]

We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC

METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with peripheral arterial disease, who were treated with "bail-out" stent implantation in the superficial femoral artery due to suboptimal PTA, were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving either external beam irradiation (6 MV photons, total dose 24 Gy in a hypofractionated schedule) plus antiplatelet therapy (EBI group) or antiplatelet therapy alone (control group). RESULTS: No procedure-related complications occurred, and all patients of the EBI group received the full dose of 24 Gy. During the long-term follow-up, an overall statistically significant difference was demonstrated in favor of the EBI group patients, regarding both the in-stent (log-rank test, p = 0.0072) and the in-segment binary restenosis (log-rank test, p = 0.0103). The primary patency rates were also significantly better in the EBI group at specific time-points, such as in the first (74.2% vs 46.5%, p = 0.019), second (62.5% vs 33.8%, p = 0.020), and third (54.6% vs 29.0%, p = 0.039) year, respectively. Moreover, the overall clinically driven reintervention rate was significantly lower among patients of the irradiated group (log-rank test, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Our long-term follow-up analysis revealed that EBI following femoral artery PTA and stenting significantly reduces restenosis and reintervention rates, while improving primary patency

Total surgical resection is rarely possible. Critical normal tissues limit the efficacy of conventional photon therapy. This study reviews our experience of using combined high dose proton and photon radiation therapy following three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1980 and September 1992, 47 patients were treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory for primary or recurrent chordomas and chondrosarcomas (group 1, 20 patients), osteogenic sarcomas (group 2, 15 patients) and giant cell tumors, osteo-or chondroblastomas (group 3, 12 patients). Radiation treatment was given postoperatively in 23 patients, pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients, and 7 patients received radiation therapy as definitive treatment modality following biopsy only. The proton radiation component was delivered using a 160 MeV proton beam and the photon component using megavoltage photons up to 23 MV energy with 1.8-2.0 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) per fraction, once a day. Total external beam target dose ranged from 55.3 CGE to 82.0 CGE with mean target doses of 73.9 CGE (group 1), 69.8 CGE (group 2), and 61.8 CGE (group 3). RESULTS: Group 1 (chordoma and chondrosarcoma): Five of 14 patients (36%) with chordoma recurred locally, and 2 out of 5 patients developed distant metastasis, resulting in 1 death from disease. A trend for improved local control was noted for primary vs. recurrent tumors, target doses > 77 CGE and gross total resection. All patients with chondrosarcoma achieved and maintained local control and disease-free status. Five-year actuarial local control and overall survival rates were 53% and 50% for chordomas and 100% and 100% for chondrosarcomas, respectively. Group 2 (osteogenic sarcoma): Three of 15 patients (20%) never achieved local control and died within 6 months of completion of radiation treatment. Only 1 out of 12 patients who were controlled for more than 6 months failed locally, yielding a 5-year local control rate of 59% for 15 patients. Overall, 4 patients (27%) developed distant metastasis (two in patients with uncontrolled primary); 4 patients succumbed to their disease, 3 patients died of intercurrent disease, resulting in overall survival of 44% at 5 years. Group 3 (giant cell tumors, osteo- and chondroblastoma): One of 8 patients with giant cell tumor failed locally, 1 patient distantly, and all patients are alive. Three of 4 patients with osteo- or chondroblastoma are alive and well. One patient suffered local recurrence and died of disease. Local control rate and overall survival for this group of 12 patients was 76% and 87% and local control for patients with giant cell tumors 83% at 5 years. In the majority of cases radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, one patient with a large base of skull tumor developed retinopathy, one patient required enucleation of a previously blind eye, and another patient with sacral tumor developed chronic diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiation therapy optimized by 3D treatment planning, allows the delivery of higher radiation doses to tumors of the axial skeleton, while respecting normal tissue constraints. High radiation doses can result in improved long-term local control

Total external beam target dose ranged from 55.3 CGE to 82.0 CGE with mean target doses of 73.9 CGE (group 1), 69.8 CGE (group 2), and 61.8 CGE (group 3). RESULTS: Group 1 (chordoma and chondrosarcoma): Five of 14 patients (36%) with chordoma recurred locally, and 2 out of 5 patients developed distant metastasis, resulting in 1 death from disease. A trend for improved local control was noted for primary vs. recurrent tumors, target doses > 77 CGE and gross total resection. All patients with chondrosarcoma achieved and maintained local control and disease-free status. Five-year actuarial local control and overall survival rates were 53% and 50% for chordomas and 100% and 100% for chondrosarcomas, respectively. Group 2 (osteogenic sarcoma): Three of 15 patients (20%) never achieved local control and died within 6 months of completion of radiation treatment. Only 1 out of 12 patients who were controlled for more than 6 months failed locally, yielding a 5-year local control rate of 59% for 15 patients. Overall, 4 patients (27%) developed distant metastasis (two in patients with uncontrolled primary); 4 patients succumbed to their disease, 3 patients died of intercurrent disease, resulting in overall survival of 44% at 5 years. Group 3 (giant cell tumors, osteo- and chondroblastoma): One of 8 patients with giant cell tumor failed locally, 1 patient distantly, and all patients are alive. Three of 4 patients with osteo- or chondroblastoma are alive and well. One patient suffered local recurrence and died of disease. Local control rate and overall survival for this group of 12 patients was 76% and 87% and local control for patients with giant cell tumors 83% at 5 years. In the majority of cases radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, one patient with a large base of skull tumor developed retinopathy, one patient required enucleation of a previously blind eye, and another patient with sacral tumor developed chronic diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiation therapy optimized by 3D treatment planning, allows the delivery of higher radiation doses to tumors of the axial skeleton, while respecting normal tissue constraints. High radiation doses can result in improved long-term local control

However, in general, it is totally overwhelmed by the benefit of the treatment. The same is true to a large extent for the combinations of radiation and drug therapy. After fast neutron therapy, the risk of induction of a second cancer is greater than after photon therapy. Neutron RBE increases with decreasing dose and there is a wide evidence that neutron RBE is greater for cancer induction (and for other late effects relevant in radiation protection) than for cell killing. Animal data on RBE for tumor induction are reviewed, as well as other biological effects such as life shortening, malignant cell transformation in vitro, chromosome aberrations, genetic effects. These effects can be related, directly or indirectly, to cancer induction to the extent that they express a "genomic" lesion. Almost no reliable human epidemiological data are available so far. For fission neutrons a RBE for cancer induction of about 20 relative to photons seems to be a reasonable assumption. For fast neutrons, due to the difference in energy spectrum, a RBE of 10 can be assumed. After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average). The RBE of heavy-ions for cancer induction can be assumed to be similar to fission neutrons, i.e. about 20 relative to photons. However, after heavy-ion beam therapy, the risk should be divided by 3, as after proton therapy due to the excellent physical selectivity of the irradiation. Therefore a risk 5 to 10 times higher than photons could be assumed. This range is probably a pessimistic estimate for carbon ions since most of the normal tissues, at the level of the initial plateau, are irradiated with low-LET radiation

This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. RESULTS: The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. CONCLUSION: The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity

The relationship between dose, volume, and PG function is explored. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1982 to October 1997, 107 adults with non-PG and non-HT neoplasms (predominantly chordoma and chondrosarcomas) of the BOS were treated with PPRT after subtotal resection(s). The median age was 41.2 years (range, 17-75) with 58 males and 49 females. Median prescribed target dose was 68.4 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) (range, 55.8-79 CGE) at 1.80-1.92 CGE per fraction per day (where CGE = proton Gy x 1.1). The HT and PG were outlined on planning CT scans to allow dose-volume histograms (DVH) analysis. All patients had baseline and follow-up clinical testing of anterior and posterior pituitary function including biochemical assessment of thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal function, and prolactin secretion. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial overall survival rate was 87%, with median endocrine follow-up time of 5.5 years, thus the majority of patients were available for long-term follow-up. Five-year actuarial rates of endocrinopathy were as follows: 72% for hyperprolactinemia, 30% for hypothyroidism, 29% for hypogonadism, and 19% for hypoadrenalism. The respective 10-year endocrinopathy rates were 84%, 63%, 36%, and 28%. No patient developed diabetes insipidus (vasopressin deficiency). Growth hormone deficiency was not routinely followed in this study. Minimum target dose (Dmin) to the PG was found to be predictive of endocrinopathy: patients receiving 50 CGE or greater at Dmin to the PG experiencing a higher incidence and severity (defined as the number of endocrinopathies occurring per patient) of endocrine dysfunction. Dmax of 70 CGE or greater to the PG and Dmax of 50 CGE or greater to the HT were also predictive of higher rates of endocrine dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced damage to the HT & PG occurs frequently after high-dose PPRT to the BOS and is manifested by anterior pituitary gland dysfunction. Hyperprolactinemia was detected in the majority of patients. Posterior pituitary dysfunction, represented by vasopressin activity with diabetes insipidus, was not observed in this dose range. Limiting the dose to the HT and PG when feasible should reduce the risk of developing clinical hypopituitarism

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether childbearing may be a favorable prognostic factor in melanoma of the uveal tract. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SETTING: Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death from metastatic choroidal melanoma. METHODS: We evaluated a consecutive series of 1818 patients with choroidal melanoma, 748 parous and 165 nulliparous women and 905 men, after treatment with proton irradiation. Three hundred fifty-two deaths from metastasis were documented in follow-up. RESULTS: Overall multivariate-adjusted death rates from metastasis were approximately 25% higher in nulliparous women (relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.82) and men (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00-1.56) than in women who had given birth. The protective influence of parity was strongest in the early period following diagnosis and treatment (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.88-2.86, and RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.04-2.19, in nulliparous women and men, respectively, during the first 36 months of follow-up). The level of protection increased with the number of live births (P for trend, .04). CONCLUSION: These data provide support for the hypothesis that a history of childbearing confers protection from death in choroidal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control

RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients.

The 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival rates for these 133 patients were 82% and 61%, respectively. Stage for stage, the development of local regional failure was reduced for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy compared with a historic control series. Local recurrence occurred in 8%, 21%, and 31% of patients with Stage B3, C2, and C3 tumors who had radiation therapy, respectively, whereas the local failure rates were 31%, 36%, and 53% in patients treated with surgery alone. There was a 13% and 12% improvement in the 5-year disease-free survival rate in the patients with Stage B3 and C3 lesions who had radiotherapy compared with the historic controls. For patients with Stage C disease, local control and disease-free survival rates decreased progressively with increasing nodal involvement; however, local control and disease-free survival rates were higher in the patients who had radiotherapy than in those who had surgery alone. Failure patterns in the patients who had radiotherapy did not show any notable changes compared with those for patients who had surgery alone. Postoperative radiation therapy for Stage B3, C2, and C3 colonic carcinoma is a promising treatment approach that deserves further investigation

These include gamma units using cobalt-60; beams of protons, helium ions and neutrons; and modified cobalt-60 or linear accelerator units. These techniques allow delivery of a high dose of radiation in a single fraction to a small and well-defined intracranial volume, without delivering significant radiation to adjacent normal tissue. The most usual targets for radiosurgery are arteriovenous malformations. It is occasionally used for acoustic neuromas and primary or metastatic brain malignancies as well. Although radiosurgery is not a new procedure, its use is becoming more widespread. Nurses, as critical members of radiosurgery teams, must be informed about all aspects of the procedures and associated nursing care skills. [References: 7]

Charged particles of proton mass or greater manifest unique physical properties that can be used to place a high dose of radiation preferentially within the boundaries of a deeply located intracranial target volume. Since 1954, nearly 10000 patients have been treated using this technique. Treated disorders include pituitary tumors, vascular malformations, primary and metastatic brain tumors, and subfoveal neovascularization. Charged-particle radiosurgery is particularly advantageous for the conformal treatment of large and/or irregularly shaped lesions, or for the treatment of lesions located in front of or adjacent to sensitive brain structures.

It can be a very useful complement of traditional microsurgery, pharmacotherapy or fractionated radiotherapy which are seldom a sufficient treatment on their own. The modern radiosurgery does not offer the experience representative enough in this indication. We can offer results of medium long follow-up for tumor growth and hormonal hypersecretion of pituitary adenomas in a relatively large series of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analyzed a group of 163 patients with pituitary adenoma treated with gamma knife during 5 years and followed 12-60 months, median 24 months after irradiation. An antiproliferative effect has been achieved in 1-2 years using the minimal dose to the margin 16-35 Gy, median 20 Gy in all our patients who were controlled by MRI (n = 126 patients). One half of these adenomas evidently decreased their size. Our effective antiproliferative dose was safe for the surrounding structures. The hormonal normalization has been achieved at 50.4% from 133 hypersecreting adenomas (39/91 = 43% of acromegalics, 11/13 = 85% of patients with Cushing's disease, 2/9 = 22% of patients with Nelson's syndrome, 11/18 = 61% of prolactinomas). The median latency was 12 months. The minimal dose to the margin was 10-45 Gy, median 35 Gy. Rare side effects were provoked only by increasing the dose to influence the hypersecretion-the development of partial hypopituitarism in 3.1% of patients, the panhypopituitarism in 0.6% of patient and there was 1 hemianopic visual field defect (0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery by gamma knife has a similar value for pituitary adenomas as microsurgery has with different distribution of advantages and drawbacks. This makes it suitable for the combined treatment where pharmacotherapy has its place under special conditions. Fractionated radiotherapy has now a marginal importance

DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 consecutive incident cases were treated at the Biomedical Cyclotron Centre (Nice, France) from June 1991 to December 1997. Overall, metastasis-free, local recurrence-free, and enucleation-free survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 78.1% (SE: 3.7%). A largest basal tumor diameter (LTD) below 10 mm and female sex were independently associated with a better prognosis. The 5-year metastasis-free survival rate was 75.6% (SE: 3.6%). Only an LTD above 10 mm and ciliary body involvement were independently associated with metastasis. Ten patients (4.5%) had a local recurrence, which was correlated with the risk of metastasis (P =.045). The 5-year enucleation-free survival rate was 69.6% (SE: 4.0%). Once again, an LTD below 10 mm and female sex were predictive of a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our results with proton-beam therapy correspond to those reported in the literature. This treatment strategy is safe and yields predictably good results. In addition to the two independent prognostic factors for survival and metastasis, namely LTD and ciliary body involvement, sex also had a significant impact in our case series, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown

These include patients with advanced nonresectable tumors in many different sites treated with a variety of neutron beam generators varying widely in beam energy. Protocols were largely nonrandomized and included both mixed beam studies (neutrons + photons) and neutrons alone in varying doses. In spite of wide variation in equipment, treatment technique, and philosophy, some consistent trends have been identified: (1) in general, the neutron results have been at least as good as those of the photon controls measured in terms of local control, although the incidence of significant side effects have been higher; (2) in none of the randomized studies conducted so far, largely comprising epidermoid carcinomas of the head and neck, has a clear survival advantage for neutrons over photon controls been demonstrated at a statistically significant level; (3) results with mixed beam studies have been uniformly equivocal, with marginally significant differences in favor of the experimental groups compared with the photon controls; (4) adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, including tumors of the salivary gland, pancreas, stomach, and bowel, appear to be responsive to high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation; (5) nonepidermoid, radioresistant tumors (sarcoma of bone and soft tissue and melanoma) yield a consistantly high local control rate, with neutron irradiation strikingly superior to those reported with photon therapy; and (6) in the central nervous system, both normal tissues and tumors appear to be exceptionally sensitive to neutron irradiation, therapeutic ratios are small, and the prospect of cure remains remote. It is concluded that neutrons are efficacious for certain specific tumor types, but that essentially new study designs, based on nonrandomized matched case comparisons, will be required to prove the merit of the new modality

Three-dimensional conformation of the treatment volume to the target volume can thus be achieved. Following previously reported Phase I and Ib clinical trials, a Phase II trial was initiated with the goal of treating primary deep-seated tumors in a dose optimization schedule which included stepwise increase of total pion dose and of target volume. Patients with multicentric superficial bladder tumors who were cystectomy candidates were initially selected. Since then, more invasive cases have been treated. A graded scoring of acute tissue reactions was employed. Follow-up periods were from 10 to 20 months. The pion dose escalation ranged from 3000 rad (minimum) to 3600 rad (minimum) in 20 fractions over 5 weeks. The treatment volumes encompassed 190 cc for local to 1,820 cc for extended volume therapy. Treatment reactions ranged from a faint erythema and increase of bladder frequency to dry desquamation, mild nausea, moderate dysuria, and moderate proctitis or diarrhea with mucus. These reactions were closely related to treatment volume and site. One severe late cystitis has occurred in a patient treated with 2 courses of pions (4475 rad). Mild to moderate late proctitis has been seen in 4 patients. Ten of 13 bladder cancer patients had local control of disease while all 3 pancreas or biliary tract cancer patients had microscopic residual disease locally at time of death from metastasis. A total of 11 of 17 patients are thus clinically or pathologically free of local tumor to time of last observation

The median follow-up is 17 months. In 51 patients (48.5%) initial PSA levels exceeded the maximum normal value of 20 ng/ml. Nine patients kept non-declining high levels just after radiotherapy. Only one of these is free of disease. Assuming PSA levels decrease exponentially during radiotherapy, a mean half-life of 62 days (median 54, SD 26 days) was calculated. Three out of five patients with a PSA half-life of more than 88 days relapsed as compared to a 8% (3/37) relapse rate in patients with a "normal" half-life. Prolonged PSA half-life suggests residual disease. PSA levels are expected to further decrease after radiation. Six months after irradiation persistent high PSA levels were found in 14/51 (27.5%) patients. Only four of them had no evidence of manifest disease. Important negative prognostic factors for disease control in our series were non-declining high levels of PSA, a PSA serum half-life exceeding 88 days and persistence of elevated PSA values longer than six months after treatment. In our opinion, PSA is a valuable marker in the follow-up of prostate cancer patients during and after radiotherapy

The significance of this effect for cancer risk assessment and radiotherapy treatment planning requires demonstration of its relevance in vivo. The problem in demonstrating the existence of the effect in vivo is that other systemic effects may mask or confound the effect being investigated and it is practically impossible to attribute an effect in a particular cell to a signal produced in another irradiated cell. To approach this problem, an assay has been developed where fragments of human tissue can be irradiated ex vivo and the media harvested and added to unirradiated, clonogenic cells which have a well characterised and stable response to the bystander signal. The variation in the production of a signal from patient to patient can thus be assessed. The results of a study using tissue from over 100 patients attending Beaumont and St Vincent's Hospitals in Dublin for investigation of urological disorders including follow-up after treatment for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and resection of suspect prostatic lesions, are now available. Blood samples from the prostate group were also obtained. The results show that there is variation in the effect of the signal produced by irradiated tissue from different patients. This holds for bladder, prostate and blood. Gender, smoking status and the existence of a malignancy influence the expression of the signal by normal tissue. Male gender, smoking and a pre-existing malignancy all reduce the amount or effect of the signal produced into medium when the tissue is exposed. The effects of exposure to medium containing the signal are transmitted to distant progeny of the exposed cell population. The results may be important not only for understanding radiation risk mechanisms for protection but also for radiotherapy treatment planning where they may open new avenues for development of drugs for combined therapy

The results, prognostic factors and live-tables will be demonstrated. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1984 and 1995 48 patients were treated at the Department of Radiooncology at the University of Munster because of epidural metastases. All but 3 cases were histologically proved. Three patients were irradiated without definitive histology because of clinical symptoms and CT or MR-imaging. Only patients with solid tumors were considered-patients with systemic diseases like leukemia or lymphoma were not analysed. In all of our cases irradiation was combined with systemic steroid application. Radiotherapy was performed with cobalt-60 or with an accelerator with total doses between 25 Gy and 40 Gy. RESULTS: The combination of irradiation and steroids had resulted in pain relief in about 80% of all patients. The ambulatory status after paraparesis was restituted in 35%. Best prognosis had been seen in patients with the following criterions: primary tumor should be breast cancer, no evidence of other tumor manifestation, no signs of paraparesis or paraplegia before the beginning of irradiation or regaining the ambulatory status after therapy. Under these conditions we have calculated a median survival rate of 709 days for these patients with good prognosis. Patients with bronchogenic carcinoma had a very poor prognosis with a median survival rate of only 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural metastases in cancer led often to a very fatal outcome. Irradiation is useful for pain relief and also for local tumor control. In some cases in patients with good prognostic factors long-time survival could be demonstrated. The results of irradiation are comparable with those after surgery

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1993 and 2004, 88 patients with iris melanoma received proton beam radiotherapy, with 53.1 Gy in 4 fractions. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 52 years and a median follow-up of 2.7 years. The tumors had a median diameter of 4.3 mm, involving more than 2 clock hours of iris in 32% of patients and more than 2 hours of angle in 27%. The ciliary body was involved in 20%. Cataract was present in 13 patients before treatment and subsequently developed in another 18. Cataract had a 4-year rate of 63% and by Cox analysis was related to age (p = 0.05), initial visual loss (p < 0.0001), iris involvement (p < 0.0001), and tumor thickness (p < 0.0001). Glaucoma was present before treatment in 13 patients and developed after treatment in another 3. Three eyes were enucleated, all because of recurrence, which had an actuarial 4-year rate of 3.3% (95% CI 0-8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma is well tolerated, the main problems being radiation-cataract, which was treatable, and preexisting glaucoma, which in several patients was difficult to control

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system for the exchange of radiotherapy data between different commercial planning systems and a specially developed planning system for proton therapy has been developed through the use of the PAPYRUS diagnostic image standard as an intermediate format. To ensure the cooperation of the different TPS manufacturers, the number of data sets defined for transfer has been restricted to the three core data sets of CT, VOIs, and three-dimensional dose distributions. As a complement to the exchange of data, network-wide application-sharing (video-conferencing) technologies have been adopted to provide methods for the interactive discussion and assessment of treatments plans with one or more partner clinics. RESULTS: Through the use of evaluation plans based on the exchanged data, referring clinics can accurately assess the advantages offered by proton therapy on a patient-by-patient basis, while the practicality or otherwise of the proposed treatments can simultaneously be assessed by the proton therapy center. Such a system, along with the interactive capabilities provided by video-conferencing methods, has been found to be an efficient solution to the problem of patient assessment and selection at a specialized treatment center, and is a necessary first step toward the full electronic integration of such centers with their remotely situated referral centers

The performance of the unit and different variants of dosimetric therapeutic plans of the fast electron beam are presented. Electron therapy with the energy of 6 MeV was mostly used in patients with head and neck tumors. Intra-oral irradiation with fast electrons was given to 4 patients with cancer of the moving part of the tongue and 5 patients with cancer of the fundic oral mucosa, the soft palate and the buccal mucosa in the form of combined or concomitant therapy. Summary focal doses in irradiation with fast electrons were 45-63 Gy for a combined or radical therapeutic course. A noticeable tumor regression was observed in patients with cancer of the skin, vermilion border and breast cancer recurrences. Though there were very few cases the results of concomitant and combined radiotherapy of cancer of the oral mucosa were promising. The first results of clinical application of the small-size PMB-6E betatron have shown its high efficacy for the treatment of superficial tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred and twenty-one cases of NPC, treated in the Cancer Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), with computed tomography scanning before initial radiotherapy, are analyzed. Important prognostic factors that form the basis of the new staging system are screened out by means of Cox model and clinical experiences. Survival curves of various kinds of T and N stages are compared by computer simulation. A new staging system is proposed by studying the traditional staging systems such as the AJC, UICC, Ho's and Changsha systems. RESULTS: According to the new staging criteria, the 5-year survival rates for Stages I-IV are 89.7%, 75.9%, 51.3%, and 22.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new clinical staging for NPC based on a large amount of cases multivariate analysis is satisfactory and widely used in China

Because rectal toxicity is a concern with radiation and may be exacerbated by hyperthermia, definition of the association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity is important. In this report, we correlate rectal toxicity with thermal dose parameters for patients treated with hyperthermia and radiation for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T2b-T3b disease (1992 American Joint Committee On Cancer criteria) enrolled in a Phase II study of external beam radiation +/- androgen-suppressive therapy with two transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia treatments were assessed for rectal toxicity. Prostatic and anterior rectal wall temperatures were monitored for all treatments. Rectal wall temperatures were limited to 40 degrees C in 19 patients, 41 degrees C in 3 patients, and 42 degrees C in 8 patients. Logistic regression was used to estimate the log hazard of developing National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 toxicity based on temperature parameters. The following were calculated: hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, p values for statistical significance of each parameter, and proportion of variability explained for each parameter. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal toxicity was limited to Grade 2. The rate of acute Grade 2 proctitis was greater for patients with an allowable rectal wall temperature of >40 degrees C. In this group, 7 of 11 patients experienced acute Grade 2 proctitis, as opposed to 3 of 19 patients in the group with rectal wall temperatures limited to 40 degrees C (p = 0.004). Preliminary assessment of long-term toxicity revealed no differences in toxicity. Hazard ratios for acute Grade 2 proctitis for allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax were 9.33 (p = 0.01), 3.66 (p = 0.03), and 2.29 (p = 0.08), respectively. A model combining these three parameters explained 48.6% of the variability among groups. CONCLUSION: Rectal toxicity correlates with maximum allowable rectal wall temperature, average rectal wall Tmax, and average prostate Tmax for patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia combined with radiation for treatment of advanced clinically localized prostate cancer. Further definition of this association of thermal dose parameters with rectal toxicity in treatment of pelvic malignancies with hyperthermia should advance the goal of delivering thermal therapy in an effective yet safe manner

The use of IORT as a single component of radiation exposure does not lead to significant radiation damages to normal tissues. When IORT is combined with remote irradiation (the latter using doses of 30-60 Gy), 30% of patients develop radiation-induced normal tissue lesions. In the context of enhancing the local effect and, if possible, decreasing the dose of remote irradiation, it is expedient to increase IORT doses, which is in turn fraught with higher incidence and severity of radiation lesions. In this connection, it seems urgent to have a look for the potentialities to expand the radiotherapeutical range. This follows several directions

To evaluate the effectiveness of fast neutron therapy, mixed neutron-photon fractionated irradiation, on squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, 98 patients with Stage IIIb disease were examined to study the correlation between local control rate and histological types. The local control rate after neutron-mixed beam therapy was 73%, which decreased to 66% with photon irradiation. The five year survival rate was 49% for patients receiving neutron therapy and 49% for those receiving photon therapy. There was no statistical significance between neutron and photon therapy; we then attempted to analyze histological types to check for any gain using neutron therapy. This study was a nonrandomized trial. The preliminary results however, gave us useful information for the next of neutron therapy

Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated

The last technique, though very expensive, provides improved dose distributions and dose localizations in the treatment of tumours adjacent to critical normal tissues. The technique of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is now being used at an increasingly large number of centers in the treatment of lesions in the brain, and the head and neck. This article describes the successful extension of the stereotactic technique to the treatment of ocular melanoma: an eye fixation aid is attached to a noninvasive, relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame together with a simple eye-movement tracking system. 2003 American College of Medical Physics

Short-term effects at 2 months following treatment were studied in a further three patients. MRI abnormalities were observed in nine patients. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls (n = 17) were seen in any of the calculated 1H-MRS metabolite ratios, in any of the three patient groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis there was a correlation between the choline/water ratio and a low IQ. It is concluded that any systematic radiation-induced changes in the 1H MRS metabolites must be below the detection threshold of this study

METHODS: Retrospective review of 78 patients with 60 medium and 18 large-size choroidal melanomas at a median follow-up of 34 months. RESULTS: The 5-year data for local control, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were estimated to be 90.5 +/- 3.7%, 76.2 +/- 6.7%, and 75.6 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Eye preservation was achieved in 75.3% of patients, with useful (better than 20/200) visual acuity (VA) in 49.1% of surviving patients. Both local failure and complications led to enucleation. Prognosticators were tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.003), large tumors involving the ciliary body (p = 0.041), and local failure (p < 0.001). Prognostic factors for VA following PRT were initial VA (p = 0.001), doses to optic disc (p = 0.001) and fovea (p = 0.022) higher than 35 CGE (Cobalt Gray equivalent), tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.034), and retinal detachment (p < 0.001). Tumor basis diameter was significantly related to metastases free survival (p = 0.02), overall survival (p = 0.033), and disease specific survival (p = 0.017), but did not impair local tumor control, rate of enucleation, and VA. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that PRT is an effective and safe treatment for medium and large size choroidal melanoma. PRT can preserve the eye and its function in a reasonable percentage of patients. Further evaluation in controlled clinical trials comparing PRT to plaque radiotherapy and enucleation is required

METHODS: Retrospective review of 78 patients with 60 medium and 18 large-size choroidal melanomas at a median follow-up of 34 months. RESULTS: The 5-year data for local control, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were estimated to be 90.5 +/- 3.7%, 76.2 +/- 6.7%, and 75.6 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Eye preservation was achieved in 75.3% of patients, with useful (better than 20/200) visual acuity (VA) in 49.1% of surviving patients. Both local failure and complications led to enucleation. Prognosticators were tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.003), large tumors involving the ciliary body (p = 0.041), and local failure (p < 0.001). Prognostic factors for VA following PRT were initial VA (p = 0.001), doses to optic disc (p = 0.001) and fovea (p = 0.022) higher than 35 CGE (Cobalt Gray equivalent), tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.034), and retinal detachment (p < 0.001).

This study evaluates modern LINAC technology for the creation of a sharp, small and functionally eloquent lesion in the thalamus. METHODS: Three patients underwent thalamotomy using a dedicated linear accelerator to radiosurgery, 2 females and 1 male, ages were 52, 53, and 73 years. Two patients presented with unilateral poststroke central pain and 1 with unilateral upper extremity pain secondary to metastatic infiltration of the brachial plexus. Maximal doses varied from 150 to 200 Gy, delivered by a 5-mm diameter collimator and 5 to 8 noncoplanar arcs evenly distributed. RESULTS: All patients gained substantial relief of their pain. They were able to reduce their medications and improve their activity levels. The patient with end-stage metastatic disease died of his malignancy 2 weeks after the treatment. One patient presented with recurrence of the pain 4 months after the treatment. No clinical complications were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated linear accelerator is able to perform a precise and circumscribed lesion in the thalamus for pain control. Moreover, it proved to be safe, because no complications were observed. For patients using chronic anticoagulant therapy or with severe disabilities caused by cardiac, pulmonary or malignant diseases, this technique represents an alternative of treatment to radiofrequency thalamotomy

To achieve this goal, tighter treatment margins are needed, which require more accurate delineation of the prostate target and normal tissue at the time of treatment planning and before actual daily treatments. Modem radiation therapy techniques can deposit conformal dose virtually anywhere in the body; however, this precise therapy is of no value if it is not accurately hitting the target. Whether dose escalation is achieved by external beam techniques (eg, IMRT, protons) or brachytherapy, these ba-sic planning and delivery considerations are essentially the same. Future directions in prostate radiation therapy will use even higher radiation doses,alternative fractionation patterns, intraprostatic targets (eg, prostate tumor seen on MRI), and improved patient selection regarding which patients will benefit the most from these advanced techniques.

The various elements of this equipment make possible well defined and structured procedures for treatment planning with different steps and essential tools used by this technique. We describe the means used and indicate future improvements that will lead to automation in order to provide good quality assurance, better security and substantial time saving. During the first year, 115 patients were treated with this new technique. They presented with central nervous system tumors (32 patients), lung cancer (29 patients), prostate cancer (20 patients), paranasal sinus tumors (14 patients) and tumors located in other sites (13 patients with soft sarcoma, hepato-bilary tumor, etc).

1	4303	A dual computed tomography linear accelerator unit for stereotactic radiation therapy: a new approach without cranially fixated stereotactic frames	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Head, Humans, Japan, Methods, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To perform stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) without cranially fixated stereotactic frames, we developed a dual computed tomography (CT) linear accelerator (linac) treatment unit. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This unit is composed of a linac, CT, and motorized table. The linac and CT are set up at opposite ends of the table, which is suitable for both machines. The gantry axis of the linac is coaxial with that of the CT scanner. Thus, the center of the target detected with the CT can be matched easily with the gantry axis of the linac by rotating the table. Positioning is confirmed with the CT for each treatment session. Positioning and treatment errors with this unit were examined by phantom studies. Between August and December 1994, 8 patients with 11 lesions of primary or metastatic brain tumors received SRT with this unit. All lesions were treated with 24 Gy in three fractions to 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the 80% isodose line, with or without conventional external beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: Phantom studies revealed that treatment errors with this unit were within 1 mm after careful positioning. The position was easily maintained using two tiny metallic balls as vertical and horizontal marks. Motion of patients was negligible using a conventional heat-flexible head mold and dental impression. The overall time for a multiple noncoplanar arcs treatment for a single isocenter was less than 1 h on the initial treatment day and usually less than 20 min on subsequent days. Treatment was outpatient-based and well tolerated with no acute toxicities. Satisfactory responses have been documented. CONCLUSION: Using this treatment unit, multiple fractionated SRT is performed easily and precisely without cranially fixated stereotactic frames

At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, patient treatment with the 70 MeV proton beam began in November 1979, and 29 patients were treated through December 1984. Of 11 patients who received protons only, 9 have had local control of the tumor. Two of the 9 patients, suffering from recurrent tumor after radical photon beam irradiation, developed complications after proton treatment. In the patients treated with photons or neutrons followed by proton boost, tumors were controlled in 12 of 18 patients (66.6%), and no complications were observed in this series. Malignant melanoma could not be controlled with the proton beam. A spot-beam-scanning system for protons has been effectively used in the clinical trials to minimize the dose to the normal tissues and to concentrate the dose in the target volume. At the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center, University of Tsukuba, treatment with a vertical 250 MeV proton beam was begun in April 1983, and 22 patients were treated through February 1984. Local control of the tumor was observed in 14 of 22 patients (63.6%), whereas there was no local control in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. There have been no severe complications in patients treated at PARMS. The results suggest that local control of tumors will be better with proton beams than with photon beams, whereas additional modalities are required to manage radioresistant tumors

1	1874	Refinement of the basic treatment equivalent model to reflect radiotherapy treatment throughput using Australasian data	Australia, Data Collection, Electrons, Female, Humans, Male, Models,Biological, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], New South Wales, New Zealand, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Research, Time	A model of radiotherapy linear accelerator throughput has been developed and shown to be a more sensitive measure of throughput than current measures of throughput. The present study aims to develop a more sensitive basic treatment equivalent (BTE) model that still measures linear accelerator throughput and considers some of the shortcomings of the previous model. All radiation oncology departments in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate. Departments were asked to time with a stopwatch all episodes of radiotherapy treatment over a 4-week period. Data collected for each treatment fraction included treatment intent, tumour site, patient age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, number of fields used, number of wedges used, number of junctions, number of shielding blocks used, whether the treatment was the first fraction, the use of general anaesthesia and whether port films or electronic portal imaging was used. Twenty-six departments of radiation oncology (70%) participated in this trial. A total of 7929 fractions of treatment, administered to 2424 patients, were timed. The factors found to most significantly impact on treatment duration on multivariate analysis were the type of fraction (first fraction was longer than subsequent fractions), type of beam (electrons were quicker than photons, which were quicker than mixed), number of fields, number of shields, number of junctions, number of port films and performance status (ECOG < 2 vs > 2). The age of the patient, number of compensators and the sex of the patient were not significant. The relationships between factors were assessed, and models of measuring linear accelerator throughput which consider complexity corrections were derived. It is possible to show that linear accelerator throughput is poorly measured by just considering numbers of patients or fields treated per unit time; and that other factors that impact on treatment duration must be considered. A more sensitive model of patient throughput is suggested; but even when a large number of factors are considered, some insensitivity still remains in the model

The main objective of postoperative radiotherapy should be the sterilisation of residual cancer cells in the operative area, while irradiation of the whole breast may be avoided. We have developed a new technique of intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) of a breast quadrant after the removal of the primary carcinoma. A mobile linear accelerator (linac) with a robotic arm is utilised delivering electron beams able to produce energies from 3 to 9 MeV. Through a perspex applicator, the radiation is delivered directly to the mammary gland and to spare the skin from the radiation, the skin margins are stretched out of the radiation field. To protect the thoracic wall, an aluminium-lead disc is placed between the gland and the pectoralis muscle. Different dose levels were tested from 10 to 21 Gy without important side-effects. We estimated that a single fraction of 21 Gy is equivalent to 60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions at 2 Gy/fraction. Seventeen patients received a dose of IORT of 10 to 15 Gy as an anticipated boost to external radiotherapy, while 86 patients received a dose of 17-19-21 Gy intra-operatively as their whole treatment. The follow-up time of the 101 patients varied from 1 to 17 months (mean follow-up time was 8 months). The IORT treatment was very well accepted by all of our patients, either due to the rapidity of the radiation course in cases where IORT was given as the whole treatment or to the shortening of the subsequent external radiotherapy in cases where IORT was given as an anticipated boost. We believe that single dose IORT after breast resection for small mammary carcinomas may be an excellent alternative to the traditional postoperative radiotherapy. However, a longer follow-up is needed for a better evaluation of the possible late side-effects

As examples of such contribution, radiobiologically-elaborated continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) has been proven to be superior to conventional radiotherapy against non-small cell lung cancer, and a hypoxic cell sensitizer nimorazole has been proven to be effective against pharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal cancers. Based on laboratory studies, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone in many cancers. Radiation biology has also provided important fundamental data for clinical applications of heavy ion and proton beam therapy. In the future, useful predictive assays and radioprotectors are also expected to be developed. Radiation biology should continue to contribute to the further development of clinical radiation therapy. [References: 13]

The output timing signal from the system is transferred to the proton accelerator for synchronized irradiation. The timing signal is set during the expiratory phase at a duration of 1.5 to 2 seconds. The efficacy of this method was evaluated by dose volume histogram based on the treatment planning program with CT images. The volume spared by this novel method was calculated in several cases, and results suggest that the method was highly effective

In clinically organ-confined prostate cancer, it may be possible, in principle, to further improve outcomes by reducing the margins of the high-dose planning target volume to the gross tumor volume and by covering the clinical target volume with a dose sufficient to control microscopic extensions of the tumor. This would allow further dose escalation without increasing the risk of acute and late effects. In this paper, we undertake a careful review of existing histopathological data that support this view and discuss technical possibilities to this approach utilizing the highly conformal characteristics of proton beams and combining them with modern 4D imaging and treatment techniques.

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown

Measurements were made on neck node metastases during the radiation treatment period in 47 patients. Tumors with a slow regression rate were shown to have a high probability of recurrence. The results indicate that accurate measurements of the regression rate provide prognostic information, which is obtained early enough for the radiotherapist to consider additional treatment

A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients received a second course of PBRT. The mean interval between the first and the second PBRT course was 50.2 months (range, 8-165 months). Most patients (87%) received 70 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for both courses. Visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 30 patients initially and in 22 patients at the second treatment. The mean follow-up time after the second treatment was 50 months (range, 6-164 months). RESULTS: At the time of the last follow-up, 20 patients were classified as having no evidence of disease, defined as tumor regression or an absence of tumor progression. Nine eyes (29%) were enucleated because of local recurrence (n = 5) or intractable pain (n = 4). The 5-year eye retention rate was 55% (95% confidence interval: 25.2-77.4). Six of the 22 patients who retained the eye (27%) had useful vision (20/200 or better). CONCLUSIONS: A second course of PBRT for recurrent uveal melanoma to total doses between 118 and 140 CGE was associated with a relatively good probability of local control and a low enucleation rate. Although most patients lost vision, the majority were able to retain the reirradiated eye. Further evaluation is needed to assess metastasis-free survival of additional proton irradiation vs. enucleation after local recurrence

To assess the benefits of aggressive treatment of chordomas, the authors compared results in patients treated aggressively at the first presentation of this disease with results in patients who were similarly treated, but after recurrence. METHODS: Among 36 patients with cervical chordomas who were treated at the authors' institution, 22 underwent primary aggressive treatment (Group A) and 14 were treated secondarily after tumor recurrence (Group B). Two cases were excluded from Group A because of unrelated early deaths and three from Group B because of insufficient pre- or postoperative data. Most tumors were located at the suboccipital level and only eight cases at a level below C-2. Radiotherapy and proton therapy were similarly conducted in both groups of patients. The actuarial survival rates were 80 and 65% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, in Group A patients and 50 and 0% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, in Group B patients (p = 0.049, log-rank test). The actuarial recurrence-free rates were 70 and 35% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, in Group A and 0% at 3 years in Group B (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The numbers of recurrences per year were 0.15 in Group A and 0.62 in Group B (p > 0.05). All other parameters that were analyzed (patient age, delay before diagnosis, clinical symptoms, chondroid type of lesion, and histological features) did not prove to influence prognosis in a statistically significant manner. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive therapy, combining as radical a resection as possible with radiotherapy, seems to improve the prognoses of suboccipital and cervical chordomas when applied at the patient's first presentation with the disease

1	2421	The 62 MeV proton beam for the treatment of ocular melanoma at Clatterbridge	Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Water	A second treatment room and beam line has been constructed at the Cyclotron Unit at Clatterbridge for the purpose of using 62 MeV protons for the treatment of ocular melanoma. A uniform beam is produced by a double foil scattering system. The initial Bragg peak is spread across the target volume by the use of beam modulators. These are rotating four-vaned stepped absorbers made from Perspex. Two beam lines can be configured with different positions of modulators and range limiters. The first has a maximum penetration of 31.9 +/- 0.2 mm in water and the second a penetration of 31.2 +/- 0.2 mm. The second configuration has the advantage of less variation in beam penumbra, with a typical value of 1.7 +/- 0.1 mm for the 90% to 10% decrement lines. The patients are treated with individually shaped collimators. Beam output varies by less than 2% over the range of collimator areas used. The resulting whole-body dose equivalent to patient has also been assessed. In the first three years of operation over 250 patients have been treated	
0	3601	Pediatric medulloblastoma: radiation treatment technique and patterns of failure.[see comment]	Adolescent, Brain, Cerebellar Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Medulloblastoma/ra [Radiography], Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Medulloblastoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Multivariate Analysis, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Risk, Supratentorial Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival, Survival Analysis, Switzerland, Temporal Lobe, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Failure, Universities	PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related, and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991. Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19 children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36 children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size, or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach	
1	4655	Cumulative incidence of radiation-induced cavernomas in long-term survivors of medulloblastoma	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation, Cranial Irradiation/ae [Adverse Effects], Female, Frontal Lobe, Hemangioma,Cavernous/ep [Epidemiology], Hemangioma,Cavernous/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Israel, Male, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Patients, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Retrospective Studies, Survivors, Time, Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of radiation-induced cavernomas in children treated for medulloblastoma. METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development.

METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article reviews the limited experiences on splenic irradiation in autoimmune thrombocytopenia by analyzing the current studies including 71 patients and some preliminary reports on splenic irradiation in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. RESULTS: In autoimmune thrombocytopenia between 40 and 90% of all patients responded, but most of them relapsed within 4 to 6 months after splenic irradiation. Between 10 and 20% of all patients had a sustained response. The efficacy of splenic irradiation in HIV-associated cases of thrombocytopenia is probably lower than in other forms of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, but especially in this group immunosuppressive drug treatment of autoimmune thrombocytopenia exposes some problems. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia there are some case reports about efficacy of splenic irradiation. Toxicity of splenic irradiation in both diseases was very moderate. CONCLUSIONS: For HIV patients, for elderly patients or patients at high risk for complications following splenectomy splenic irradiation might be a treatment option. Splenic irradiation as preoperative treatment in patients not responding to or not suitable for immunosuppressive drugs prior to splenectomy may be a promising new application of splenic irradiation to reduce adverse effects of splenectomy in thrombocytopenic patients. A further analysis of the biological mechanisms underlying splenic irradiation may help to improve patient selection, to optimize dose concepts and treatment schedules and will improve understanding of radiotherapy as an immunomodulatory treatment modality.

Single voxel magnetic resonance (MR) spectral data were acquired from 8 normal volunteers, 16 patients with cervical cancer before radiation therapy, and 18 patients with cervical cancer after radiation therapy using an external pelvic coil at a 1.5-T on a Signa system. The presence or absence of various resonances within each spectrum was evaluated for similarities within each patient group and for spectral differences between groups. Resonances corresponding to lipid and creatine dominated the spectrum for the eight normal volunteers without detection of a choline resonance. Spectra from 16 pretreatment patients with biopsy-proven cervical cancer revealed strong resonances at a chemical shift of 3.25 ppm corresponding to choline. Data acquired from the 18 posttreatment setting studies was variable, but often correlated well with the clinical findings. Biopsy confirmation was obtained in seven patients. H1 MRS of the cervix using a noninvasive pelvic coil consistently demonstrates reproducible spectral differences between normal and neoplastic cervical tissue in vivo. However, signal is still poor for minimal disease recurrence. Further study is needed at intervals before, during, and after definitive irradiation with biopsy confirmation to validate the accuracy of MRS in distinguishing persistence or recurrence of disease from necrosis and fibrosis

Three years before she had undergone pituitary irradiation for acromegaly and hyperthyroidism, the latter was attributed at the time to excessive TSH secretion because of elevations in plasma TSH. During the present 11/2 years of observation, TSH levels were appropriately low and did not respond to iv TRH when the patient was hyperthyroid. Moreover, they did not rise during treatment, even as the patient became borderline hypothyroid. It is concluded that hyperthyroidism probably has always been due to Graves' disease

METHODS: In this noncomparative interventional case series, 40 patients with small melanocytic tumors of the choroid (thickness <3.5 mm) underwent TTT. Follow-up examinations including ophthalmoscopy, ultrasonography, and fundus photography were conducted at 24 to 48 hours, 2 to 6 weeks, and 6-month intervals after treatment. RESULTS: Forty patients (mean age, 58 years) with small melanocytic tumors underwent TTT. Mean follow-up in all patients was 42 months. In most cases TTT resulted in tumor regression. Thirty-one (77.5%) of 40 tumors did not recur after initial treatment with TTT. In 5 (12.5%) of 40 tumors with initial basal diameters ranging from 4 x 2.75 mm to 7.5 x 6 mm and a mean initial thickness of 2.0 mm, edge recurrences developed, which were satisfactorily treated with additional TTT (4 cases) or cryotherapy (1 case). The mean interval between initial TTT and recurrence in this subgroup was 15 months (range, 7-22 months). Of 36 eyes that were successfully treated with TTT or cryotherapy, 26 eyes (72%) had posttreatment visual acuity better than or equal to pretreatment visual acuity. Four (10%) of 40 tumors were not controlled with TTT and eventually required brachytherapy (n = 1), proton radiation (n = 1), or enucleation (n = 2). The initial basal diameters of these tumors ranged from 7.5 x 7.5 mm to 9 x 7.5 mm, with a mean initial thickness of 2.6 mm. The mean interval between treatment and determination of treatment failure was 22 months (range, 7-30 months). CONCLUSIONS: Transpupillary thermotherapy resulted in tumor regression of most small melanocytic choroidal tumors. Tumor edge recurrences were successfully treated with additional TTT in most cases. Four tumors required irradiation or enucleation because of treatment failures with TTT. Transpupillary thermotherapy as a stand-alone therapy is insufficient for some small choroidal melanomas

Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

This system was based on a Leksell stereotactic head frame and a Neptun 10p linear accelerator. We performed 624 radiosurgery treatments with this system between 1991 and 2000. Our objective was to increase the reliability of operation and to extend the applicability of our radiosurgery system. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We modified our stereotactic floor stand with specially designed adapter plates to make it compatible with the Mevatron KD and Neptun 10p linear accelerators and other stereotactic head frames (Riechert-Mundiger, CRW and BrainLab). We made a new tertiary collimator holder attachable to the Mevatron KD linac. The range of treatable cerebral lesion was increased from 10-30 mm to 5-42.5 mm with additional collimator inserts. With the above modifications our radiosurgery system is compatible simultaneously with the Neptun 10p and the Mevatron KD linear accelerators. This way we were able to increase the reliability of operation of the system, as the treatment can be performed with the Neptun 10p linac in case of breakdown of the Mevatron KD linac after fixation of the head frame to a patient's skull. RESULTS: The measured diameter of the radiation isocenter defined by the new radiosurgery collimator was less than 1 mm with the Mevatron KD linac. According to the Lutz-test the distance between the radiosurgery isocenter and the rotation axis of ZIV treatment table was less than 0.5 mm. Results of phantom test showed that the overall spatial precision of our modified radiosurgery system was better than 1.3 mm with Leksell head frame. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of experiences with 662 patients' radiosurgery treatments, the extension of our first cerebral radiosurgery system to Mevatron KD linear accelerator resulted in a more reliable operation. In accordance with our phantom tests the extension of the original system did not worsen its overall spatial precision

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1989, 84 evaluable patients were treated. PR patients (n = 45) were planned/localized on the basis of biplane angiography and treated between 1989 and 2000. BL patients (n = 39) were planned/localized on the basis of CT/MRI and treated since 2000. Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival, nidus obliteration (NO), and any radiographic improvement were undertaken with Cox regression of dose and volume effects. RESULTS: No significant complication, survival, previous embolization incidence, AVM location or size differences existed between BL/PR patients. The groups differed significantly in prescribed dose (PR: 16.2 Gy, BL: 17.3 Gy, p = 0.004) and isodose (PR: 62%, BL: 79%, p < 0.0001). Estimated 2-year NO rate was 87% for BL patients, 12% for PR patients (p < 0.0001). Ultimate PR NO rate was 67% at 6 years. Dose (p = 0.037) and isodose (p = 0.014) significantly affected PR NO outcome; volume was of borderline significance (p = 0.069). No factors significantly affected BL outcome. Analyses of small (< or = 4.0 cm3), high-dose (> or = 17.0 Gy) PR patients (PR1 group) vs. BL patients still demonstrated greater NO (p = 0.04) and radiographic improvement (p = 0.0004) rates for the BL group. PR1 patients had a 76% 3-year NO rate. CONCLUSIONS: BL-based radiosurgery achieved a high NO rate, the PR method did not.

[Russian]	Adult, Aged, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Fluorouracil/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Liver Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Methotrexate/tu [Therapeutic Use], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Survival, Tegafur/tu [Therapeutic Use], Time	Conservative treatment was carried out in 119 cases of hepatic malignancy (primary cancer--36 and metastatic tumors--83). Radiation therapy using a Rokus-M installation or a Saturn linear accelerator was performed in 26 cases, chemoradiation treatment--14 and cytostatic therapy alone--in 79 patients. Single focal dose used was 2 Gy, while total dose was as high as 51-70 Gy in cases receiving radiation alone and 35-40 Gy in the combined therapy group. Various combinations of carminomycin, bleomycin, cisplatinum, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil, allopurinol and cyclophosphamide were employed. Radiation and chemoradiation treatment proved effective in 67.5% of cases. Mean survival time for patients suffering primary cancer was 15.8 +/- 4.3 months, and for those with metastatic tumor--8.3 +/- 1.6 months. Remission was registered in 14, while stabilization--in 31 out of 79 patients who had received chemotherapy. The symptomatic effect was observed in 38%

1	2625	Is immediate chest radiotherapy obligatory for any or all patients with limited-stage non-small cell carcinoma of the lung? Yes	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Small Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Energy Transfer, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Metastasis, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Survivors	External irradiation with the greatest technical sophistication available is indicated in all patients with inoperable non-small cell carcinoma of the lung confined to the primary site and to regional lymph nodes including the ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes. Irradiation with moderately high doses results in responses in 40%-65% of all patients. With irradiation to a level of at least 6000 rad in 30 fractions in 6 weeks, greater than 60% of patients never fail in the chest. Some of these patients become long-term, disease-free survivors. Until it is possible clearly to predict those patients who do not respond and thereby to justify an approach other than thoracic irradiation, it is necessary to offer radiation therapy to all of these patients. Since local control is far from satisfactory, one can certainly justify investigating new approaches, including further increases of the total dose, altered fractionation schemes, addition of radiosensitizers, and high linear energy transfer radiations. Since distant metastases frequently appear in spite of thorough pretreatment evaluations, one can also justify investigating the addition of systemic agents, both cytotoxic drugs and biologic response modifiers. Benefit from these systemic approaches may be completely masked, even in patients with disseminated disease, by failure to prevent complications and death due to the intrathoracic tumor	
1	2669	CO2 reactivity in arteriovenous malformations of the brain: a transcranial Doppler ultrasound study.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, California, Californium, Carbon, Carbon Dioxide/bl [Blood], Cerebral Arteries/pp [Physiopathology], Female, Hemodynamics, Humans, Hypocapnia/pp [Physiopathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/bl [Blood], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/us [Ultrasonography], Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Partial Pressure, Pressure, Radiation, Reference Values, Ultrasonography, Ultrasonography,Doppler,Transcranial, Universities	Arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) are congenital tangles of vessels that have a high blood flow through a low-resistance nidus. The vessels in the nidus may lack normal vasoreactivity in response to changes in PaCO2 or perfusion pressure (autoregulation). Arteriovenous malformation hemodynamics have been assessed based on the response of AVM feeding arteries to hypocapnia. Twenty-five AVM patients, aged 34 +/- 11 years (mean +/- standard deviation), were admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital for proton-beam radiation therapy. Fourteen healthy volunteers aged 30 +/- 7 years served as control subjects. Angiograms with calibrated markers permitting magnification correction were available for all patients. The limits of the middle cerebral artery, as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, were compared to measurements made on the angiograms. Hyperventilation was induced at a rate set by a metronome. Fixed bilateral Doppler probes allowed almost simultaneous sampling of two vessels. Volunteer control subjects were hyperventilated in two steps. The two PaCO2 step decreases were significant (mean resting PaCO2 40.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, Step 1 level 29.4 +/- 3.5 mm Hg and Step 2 level 23.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg; p < 0.01). These decreases induced a significant decrease in mean flow velocity (Vm) and an increase in the pulsatility index (p < 0.001). Mean carbon dioxide reactivity (% delta Vm/delta PaCO2) was 2.74 +/- 1.0 for Step 1 and 1.44 +/- 1.8 for Step 2 (p < 0.003). The mean PaCO2 decrease in patients was from 39.5 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 27.0 +/- 3.5 mm Hg. Carbon dioxide reactivity was 0.92 +/- 1.12 for feeding vessels and 2.59 +/- 1.78 for nonfeeding vessels (p < 0.001). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and angiographic depth measurements correlated well. Hyperventilation induced significantly more hemodynamic changes in control and nonfeeding middle cerebral arteries than in feeding vessels. Impaired CO2 reactivity may help to identify AVM feeding vessels as well as the relative magnitude of the flow provided to the malformation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 53 patients treated to fields encompassing the cauda equina were reviewed for the onset of neurologic symptoms in the absence of local failure. All doses were normalized to equivalent dose delivered in 2-Gy fractions. Median cauda dose was 65.8 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (range, 31.9-85.1). Median follow-up was 87 months (range, 14-217 months). RESULTS: Nineteen patients experienced local recurrences, and 13 others had neurologic toxicity. A total of 54% (i.e., 7/13) of the toxicities occurred 5 years or more after treatment. Median caudal dose was 73.7 CGE in the group with neurologic toxicity, and 55.6 CGE in those without. On multivariate actuarial analysis, cauda dose and gender were statistically significant for neurotoxicity at p = 0.002 and p = 0.017, respectively. The estimated tolerance doses 5 years from treatment, TD 5/5 and TD 50/5, were 55 CGE and 72 CGE, respectively, for males and 67 CGE and 84 CGE for females. The tolerance doses were about 8 CGE lower when estimated at 10 years from treatment. Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 66% and 53%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the probability of neurotoxicity is a relatively steep function of dose to cauda equina (slope gamma50 = approximately 3). The cauda equina tolerance is greater for females than males by about 11 CGE (at 2 CGE per fraction). Extended follow-up is necessary to accurately assess neurologic damage and then differentiate that phenomenon from local recurrence; the traditional 5-year assessment has limited meaning in this population. Local control remains an issue for these patients, even with the radical doses used

A total of 39 evaluable patients were treated with curative intent using either fast neutrons alone or in combination with low LET irradiation as part of a mixed beam fractionation scheme. Actuarial survival curves are presented for both the "neutrons alone" and the "mixed beam" treatment groups. There was no significant survival difference between these groups of patients. The projected survival at two years is less than 10%, which is comparable with megavoltage photon results for an unselected series of patients. The size of the primary lesion and the initial Karnofsky performance status were found to be the most important prognostic indications for prolonged survival. Sixteen of 39 patients were felt to have achieved local clearance of their tumor at some time during their follow-up with the median time until a local recurrence being 17 months. Treatment related complications and patterns of metastatic spread are discussed. In general, it appeared that the response of large tumors to neutron irradiation resulted in necrosis and fistula formation. In many cases this was accompanied by persistent/recurrent tumor within the high dose radiation volume

The prognosis of unresectable/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma remains very poor because the rarity of the tumor has made it difficult to establish treatment guidelines, and diagnosis and the resultant treatment can be greatly delayed. We treated a 24-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma of the right adrenal gland which extended to the inferior vena cava. Although she underwent surgical resection of the extensive tumor as the primary treatment, the disease recurred in the lung and liver as multiple metastases shortly after surgery. She received intensive multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP regimen), embolization of the feeding arteries, and proton irradiation for the liver mass. Finally, she underwent reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA 1-locus-mismatched sibling donor. A prolonged survival of 39 months after the onset of the disease was achieved. Although this experience is limited, we suggest that TIP chemotherapy was effective for adrenocortical carcinoma, and a graft-versus-tumor effect after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation may have contributed to the prolonged survival

RESULTS: The overall biochemical disease-free survival rate was 73%, and was 90% in patients with initial PSA <or=4.0; it was 87% in patients with posttreatment PSA nadirs <or=0.50. Rates dropped with rises in initial and nadir PSA values. Long-term survival outcomes were comparable with those reported for other modalities intended for cure. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton radiation therapy at the reported dose levels yielded disease-free survival rates comparable with other forms of local therapy, and with minimal morbidity.

Of the heavy charged particles, protons are the least expensive to accelerate and can be manipulated to give a sharply defined high-dose volume with a rapid fall-off of dose outside the target area. The biological properties of protons do not differ significantly from X or gamma rays. Negative pi mesons require an elaborate accelerator for their production. Pions offer the possibility of concentrating energy, some of it densely ionizing with a reduced oxygen enhancement ratio and elevated biological effectiveness within the designated tumour volume, while minimizing the dose of sparsely ionizing radiation to the normal tissues traversed. High-energy heavy ions offer the greatest flexibility and allow localized dose distributions and also, with the higher Z particles, a substantial reduction of the oxygen enhancement ratio can be achieved. The ultimate choice of particle depends upon what turns out to be the most important factor in radiotherapy--an improved localization of dose or a reduction in the dependence of cell killing on the presence of molecular oxygen

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 6 patients (7 eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and choroidal hemangiomas were reviewed. An exudative retinal detachment was the indication for treatment in all cases. The mean age of the 6 patients was 13 years (range, 4 to 20 years). The minimum follow-up time was 1 year. Patients were checked for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. The patients were treated with radiotherapy. A total dose of 20 Grays was applied to 7 eyes: 2 with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma underwent proton therapy and 5 with diffuse hemangioma were treated by external beam irradiation. RESULTS: Complete resolution of the subretinal fluid was achieved in all cases with the tumor height decreased. Visual acuity improved to 1 line or more in 5 eyes and remained stable in 2 eyes. Two cases that underwent proton therapy developed radiation retinopathy. CONCLUSION: External beam radiation is an effective and safe option in the management of choroidal hemangiomas complicated by retinal detachment. Based on our experience, proton therapy should be reserved for sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients

Plaque radiotherapy has been reported to have a higher relapse rate than charged-particle radiotherapy for posteriorly located uveal melanomas, which also are more technically difficult to localize accurately. The authors used intraoperative echography in patients with posterior uveal melanoma to determine the rate of inaccurate localization of iodine 125(125I) episcleral plaques using standard localization techniques. METHODS. The authors reviewed the records of 29 consecutive patients with medium-sized posterior uveal melanomas who underwent 125I episcleral plaque radiotherapy with intraoperative echographic verification of plaque placement. RESULTS. After careful plaque placement using standard localization techniques, 4 of 29 plaques (14%) did not cover at least one tumor margin. All four of these plaques were associated with posterior tumors with at least one margin posterior to the temporal arcades. Two (7%) additional juxtapapillary plaques were displaced away from the sclera by the optic nerve. In all six cases, it was possible to immediately reposition the plaque to achieve coverage of all tumor margins. CONCLUSIONS. Placement of 125I episcleral radioactive plaques for posteriorly located uveal melanomas using standard localization techniques occasionally results in suboptimal plaque positioning. Intraoperative echography can identify plaques that are localized poorly and allows immediate adjustment to achieve optimal plaque positioning

Group I (194 patients) was given a combination of proton irradiation of the pituitary and sequential zone gamma-ray teletherapy of the skeleton, group II (98) received the first component and group III (162 cases)--the latter component of the modality only. Cumulative survival curves for groups I and II were well approximated by exponential function of the follow-up period; mean survival was 36.4 and 11.4 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. Within a period of about 12 months, survival curves for groups I and III were nearly identical. However, with the increasing number of bony metastases, the group III curve slope tended to match that of group II. Corresponding mean survival for that segment of the curve was 13 months. Mean survival for historic control was 12.1 months. Thus, pronounced and lasting increase in survival was not observed unless the procedures were used together

Microscopic examination did not show any connection to the primary tumor. The different possibilities of pathogenesis (bloodborn metastasis to the same globe, episcleral metastasis by conjunctival lymphatics, surgical dissemination due to the suturing of tantalum marks around the primary tumor) are discussed. The ciliary melanoma has spread over the iris despite the irradiation, probably as a result of insufficient irradiation of its anterior border. The results of histologic examination of the partially necrotic, partially viable irradiated tumor are considered with regard to the conservative tumor therapy administered

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose-volume histograms were compared between photon, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton plans at doses of 66 Gy, 87.5 Gy in Stage I (n=10) and 60-63 Gy, and 74 Gy in Stage III (n=15). RESULTS: For Stage I, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 31.8%, 24.6%, and 15.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 66 Gy, whereas they were 13.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, with proton with dose escalation to 87.5 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (p=0.002). For Stage III, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 54.1%, 46.9%, and 34.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 63 Gy, whereas they were 39.7%, 36.6%, and 31.6%, respectively, for proton with dose escalation to 74 CGE (p=0.002).

METHODS: Over a 20-year period, 47 patients underwent 72 operative procedures for resection of cranial base chondrosarcomas. Thirty-three patients were previously untreated, whereas 14 patients previously had undergone surgery or radiation. Twenty-three patients had a single operation and 24 underwent staged (more than one) operations because of extensive disease. Patients who underwent subtotal resection also underwent radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Patients were evaluated at follow-up clinically and by imaging studies. RESULTS: Gross total resection was accomplished in 29 (61.7%) patients, and subtotal resection was accomplished in 18 patients (38.3%). The resection was better in patients who underwent a primary operation (gross total resection, 68.8 versus 46.7%) rather than a reoperation. Patients who underwent incomplete resection underwent postoperative radiotherapy, which included proton beam radiotherapy (15.6%), radiosurgery (68%), and fractionated radiation (15.6%). There were no operative deaths. Postoperative complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage, quadriparesis, infections, cranial nerve palsies, etc.) were observed in 10 patients (18%). The follow-up ranged from 2 to 255 months, with an average of 86 months. At the conclusion of study, 36 (76.6%) patients were alive, and 21 (44.7%) patients were alive without disease. Recurrence-free survival was 32% at 10 years in all patients, 42.3% in primary patients and 13.8% in those who underwent reoperation. The Karnofsky performance score was 82.4 +/- 9.8 before surgery, 85 +/- 12.5 at 1 year after surgery, and 85.3 +/- 5.8 at the latest follow-up. Two patients died as a result of radiotherapy complications (malignancy, radiation necrosis). CONCLUSION: Cranial base chondrosarcomas can be managed well by complete surgical resection or by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The study cannot comment about the efficacy of radiotherapy. Approximately half of the patients survived without recurrence at long-term follow-up (>132 mo). The functional status of the surviving patients was excellent at follow-up

METHODS: Cumulative rates for each type of opacity were estimated from among the 383 patients, treated between 1987 and 1989, who had clear lenses or minimal lens changes before irradiation. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the independent effects of tumor and treatment-related characteristics on the development of posterior subcapsular opacities in these patients. Risk factors for posterior subcapsular opacities were evaluated. RESULTS: By three years after irradiation, posterior subcapsular opacities had developed in 42% of the patients, and rates increased significantly with lens dose and with tumor height. The risk of posterior subcapsular opacities was over three times higher when the lens received a substantial dose of irradiation (adjusted relative risk, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-6.59), as compared with minimal dose, and was three times higher when the tumor was highly elevated (adjusted relative risk, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-6.40) as compared with minimally elevated lesions. Opacities in the other segments of the lens were age related. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that patients receiving therapeutic intraocular irradiation have a high risk of developing posterior subcapsular opacities. As expected, the leading risk determinant of posterior subcapsular change is the amount of irradiation received by the lens

0	3859	Staging of cervical carcinomas. Comparison of body-coil magnetic resonance imaging and endorectal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging with histopathologic correlation	Adult, Aged, Austria, Female, Gold, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging/mt [Methods], Radiation, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pa [Pathology]	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with body coil and endorectal surface coil techniques in the staging of cervical carcinomas and compare these results with those obtained with clinical staging (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] classification) and postsurgical histopathology. METHODS: Fifteen patients (average age, 48.6 years) with biopsy-proved cervical cancer were included in the study. After clinical staging (FIGO classification), MR imaging with body coil (BCMR) and subsequently with endorectal surface coil (ECMR) was performed. Using a 1.5-Tesla unit, axial and sagittal proton density weighted and spin echo T2-weighted and fast spin echo T2-weighted sequences were obtained with body and endorectal surface coil. During imaging analysis, special attention was paid to the uterine zones, the vaginal fornix, and the parametrial tissue. Ten patients were treated surgically (postsurgical histopathology was considered the gold standard), five patients, all clinically staged IIIb, underwent primary radiation therapy. RESULTS: Clinical staging with FIGO classification was accurate in 12 of 15 patients, and understaged in 2 and overstaged in 1 patient. Body coil MR showed accurate staging in 13 of 15 patients. Using this technique, understaging of 2 patients, both with only minimal tumor infiltration depth (< 8 mm), was performed. Endorectal surface coil MR was accurate in 14 of 15 patients missing minimal parametrial tumor infiltration in 1 patient. Histopathology (n = 10) revealed 3 patients with tumor stage T1b, 2 with stage T2a, and 5 patients with stage T2b. CONCLUSIONS: Although suggested by only a small number of patients, ECMR appears to be the most accurate modality for staging cervical carcinomas but seems to be unreliable in the detection of minimal tumor infiltration

Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans

Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans

Eligible patients were those receiving 3000 rad or more to the mediastinum and no chemotherapy prior to the radiation. During the study period, 13 patients developed symptomatic pericarditis. The interval post treatment to the development of symptoms was six to 34 months. The incidence of pericarditis was studied as a function of: (1) the dose of radiation at a depth of 2 cm, 5 cm and the midplane of the mediastinum; (2) the ratio of anterior to posterior weighting of dose; (3) the presence or absence of intrathoracic tumor; (4) the size of the tumor when present; and (5) the fraction of the heart exposed to the radiation beam. There was a significant increase in the incidence of pericarditis with an increased dose of radiation at 2 cm, 5 cm and midplane depths and also with the presence of a large intrathoracic tumor. A reduction in mediastinal dose is recommended

It is clear from current radiobiological knowledge that some of the postulates that formed the mechanistic basis for past clinical trials were incorrect. Such discrepancies, along with the inherent physical disadvantages of neutron beams in terms of collimation and intensity modulation, may partially account for the lack of therapeutic benefit observed in many randomized clinical trials. Moreover, it is equally apparent that indiscriminate prescription of fast-neutron therapy is likely to lead to an adverse clinical outcome in a proportion of patients. Hence any renewed efforts to establish a niche for this modality in clinical radiation oncology will necessitate the development of a triage system that can discriminate those patients who might benefit from fast-neutron therapy from those who might be harmed by it. In the future, fast-neutron therapy might be prescribed based upon the relative status of appropriate molecular parameters that have a differential impact upon radiosensitivity to photons compared to fast neutrons.

The C-beams were more effective in the tumour growth inhibition than X-rays. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-beams against X-rays was 2.00. It was observed that the interactive hyperthermic (42 degrees C, for 30 min) enhancement of tumour regrowth delay by high-linear energy transfer (LET) C-beams was similar to that of combination of low-LET X-rays with hyperthermia. The thermal enhancement ratios (TER) were 6.10 and 5.57 for X-rays and C-beams, respectively. These results suggest that hyperthermic treatment is effective in radiotherapy not only by low-LET radiation but also by high-LET radiation such as C-beams. In conclusion, the depression of the tumour growth by the combined treatment of hyperthermia (42 degrees C) and the C-beams strongly suggests the available possible application of interdisciplinary cancer therapy for refractory tumours

Patients were divided into two groups: early and late phase hepatic injuries. Each group was investigated 3 to 9 weeks and 4 to 65 months after the start of irradiation, respectively. T(1)-weighted, T(2)-weighted, and T(2)*-weighted images were obtained before and after SPIO administration. In all postcontrast sequences in the early phase, irradiated livers demonstrated relatively higher intensity than nonirradiated livers and the radiation-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) was improved. Postcontrast T(2)*-weighted images showed the highest C/N. In the late phase, the irradiated areas showed high intensity on T(2)-weighted images and low intensity on T(1)-weighted images without SPIO, while high intensity on T(1)-weighted images with SPIO. The C/N increased with SPIO in all sequences and postcontrast T(2)-weighted images showed the highest C/N in the late phase. SPIO-enhanced MRI is useful to evaluate this entity both in the early and late phase of clinical studies

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

New symptoms and corresponding radiologic abnormalities developed 4-28 months after therapy. Five patients had similar patterns of white matter changes and mass effect on computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images. The abnormalities were centered in the radiation field. Gray matter changes and abnormal enhancement in the thalamus and hypothalamus outside the radiation field developed in one patient. This patient also had vasculopathic changes on angiograms. Rapidly progressive large vessel vasculopathy developed in another patient and caused occlusion of major vessels. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in the complications of heavy-ion radiosurgery

[French]	Adult, Brachytherapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Environment, Humans, Lymphoma, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends]	When radiotherapy is employed for central nervous system tumours, several clinical considerations relating to the special normal tissue environment in which they are located deserve recognition. First of all the radiosensitivity of normal brain is nearly equivalent to that of the majority of the primary tumours requiring irradiation. Secondly destroyed normal neural tissue never regenates, but partial recovery is possible following limited injury. Thirdly definition of the target volume is determined mostly by indirect means from a synthesis of neuroradiological findings (C.T. scans, M.R.I.). Finally the rigidity of the intact cranium confers greater clinical significance on mass effects including postradiotherapeutic edema. Most brain tumours respond to external irradiation which may be applied either postoperatively or definitively, e.g. gliomas, lymphomas, medulloblastomas, and metastases. New stereotactic techniques, including radiosurgery, interstitial brachytherapy, and proton beam radiotherapy allow the delivery of larger dose in a limited volume

Patients in each treatment arm underwent exploratory staging laparotomy followed by concurrent radiation therapy and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Patients treated with photons received 6,000 cGy over a period of 10 weeks; patients treated with helium irradiation received a 6,000-7,000-cGy-equivalent dose over a period of 8-9 weeks. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients in the two treatment arms (P = .29). Patients treated with helium ions had a slightly longer median survival (7.8 months) than the photon-treated patients (6.5 months). Local control rates were slightly higher in the helium-treated patients (10% vs 5%). Complications included one chemotherapy-related death. Four of the five helium-treated patients who survived longer than 18 months died of local failure without distant metastases. These results suggest that more aggressive local therapy could result in improved survival in helium-treated patients

Patients treated with helium ions had a slightly longer median survival (7.8 months) than the photon-treated patients (6.5 months). Local control rates were slightly higher in the helium-treated patients (10% vs 5%). Complications included one chemotherapy-related death. Four of the five helium-treated patients who survived longer than 18 months died of local failure without distant metastases. These results suggest that more aggressive local therapy could result in improved survival in helium-treated patients

Patients in each treatment arm underwent exploratory staging laparotomy followed by concurrent radiation therapy and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Patients treated with photons received 6,000 cGy over a period of 10 weeks; patients treated with helium irradiation received a 6,000-7,000-cGy-equivalent dose over a period of 8-9 weeks.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a series of patients treated with proton beam irradiation between 1991 and December 1998. The data were analyzed to evaluate the local tumor control as well as the general progression and metastatic rate of the patients. Statistical analysis served to isolate risk factors for relapse or metastasis. RESULTS: We treated 1062 patients during the study period, with a median follow-up of 38 months. Local control was obtained for 97.1% of the patients. Tumors anterior to the equator were at risk for relapse. The survival rate was 92% at 2 years and 78% at 5 years. 73.1% of the 1062 patients died from metastasis, 6.1% of living patients presented with metastatic disease. The risk factors for death were the initial diameter, the age of the patient, and large tumor volume at diagnosis. Metastasis were essentially hepatic (94.6%). Risk factors for metastasis were: a large tumor volume, a lesion anterior or straddling the equator and the age of the patient. Ocular complications may induce a visual loss of 0.1 and less in 47% of the patients, due to optic nerve head and macular ischemia. 6% of the patients required secondary enucleation due to local complications (neovascular glaucoma). CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal melanoma allows good tumor control and eye retention. The survival prognosis is associated with the initial volume of the tumor. The functional results may be improved and new therapeutics are needed to treat metastatic disease

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August 1998 and December 2000, 37 patients with chordomas (n = 24) and chondrosarcomas (n = 13) were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy within a Phase I/II trial. Tumor conformal application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included biologic plan optimization. The median tumor dose was 60 GyE (GyE = Gy x relative biologic effectiveness). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 13 months. The local control rate after 1 and 2 years was 96% and 90%, respectively. We observed 2 recurrences outside the gross tumor volume in patients with chordomas. Progression-free survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 83% for chordomas at 2 years. Partial remission after carbon ion radiotherapy was observed in 6 patients. Treatment toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: These are the first data demonstrating the clinical feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of scanning beam delivery of ion beams in patients with skull base tumors. The preliminary results in patients with skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas are encouraging, although the follow-up was too short to draw definite conclusions concerning outcome. In the absence of major toxicity, dose escalation might be considered

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Iodine 125 plaques were used to treat all uveal melanomas between the end of 1989 and 1991. Since 1991, we have used iodine plaques for small anterior tumors and proton beam for other tumors. We use a plaque with a larger diameter than the tumor diameter (2-4mm) with a dose of 90Gy at the apex. Proton beam therapy is used for all tumors at the equator or posterior to the equator not thicker than 12mm. The dose given is 60Gy cobalt equivalent in four fractions. For each patient, the initial size and location of the tumor were noted as well as the follow-up each year: the outcome for the eye (local recurrence, ocular conservation, and functional results), the occurrence of metastasis, and survival. A statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between December 1989 and September 1998, 1272 patients were treated: 926 (72.8%) were treated with proton beam irradiation and 346 (27.8%) with iodine 125 plaques. The median follow-up was 5 years (60 months). For the patients treated with proton beam therapy, the mean age was 58 years, the tumor location was anterior to the equator for 3.8%, at the equator for 43.6%, and posterior to the equator for 52.6%. The mean tumor diameter was 13.4mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.69mm. For the patients treated with iodine 125 plaques, the mean age was 61.5 years. The location of the tumor was anterior to the equator for 34.4%, at the equator for 46.5%, and posterior to the equator for 19.1%. The mean tumor diameter was 11.5mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.12mm. The recurrence rate was 4% for the proton beam treatment and 3.75% for iodine plaques. There was no statistical difference. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the rate of local recurrence is usually higher with iodine 125 plaques than proton beam therapy. We discuss the risk factors for local recurrence after iodine 125 plaques: tumor diameter, lower dose to the tumor apex and lower dose rate, and posterior location of the tumor. We found a higher mortality rate in patients who presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: When we use iodine 125 plaques for anterior tumors with the proper dose and dose rate to the apex of the tumor, we do not find more recurrence than with proton beam therapy

Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice, but the potential spinal cord injury may limit the extent of resection. We report the long-term results of treatment of six patients diagnosed with giant cell tumor of the spine treated with radiotherapy and review the literature regarding therapy. Between 1971 and 1995, six patients with GCTS were treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy. The surgery consisted of either biopsy or subtotal resection of tumor. The involved vertebrae were then irradiated with doses ranging from 3000 to 5400 cGy. The mean follow-up was 13 years, and three of six patients had follow-up of 17 or more years. Five of six patients are alive with no evidence of disease. One is alive with disease, although it is not clinically apparent. No patient was lost to follow-up. We conclude that radiotherapy is useful in the management of GCTS and that conservative surgery with local radiotherapy is a reasonable treatment alternative for tumors that cannot be completely excised or in which surgery would result in significant functional morbidity. Although there is no clear dose response, review of the literature suggests that doses ranging from 3500 to 4500 cGy are safe and effective in controlling giant cell tumor. [References: 24]

In osteogenesis imperfecta hyperplastic heterotopic ossification can be induced by hyperplastic callus formation caused by trauma or operation. Heterotopic ossifications can be found in numerous benign diseases. The successful use of low dose radiotherapy in the treatment of heterotopic ossifications is well-known from the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated two children (a 13-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy) with heterotopic ossifications of the lower extremities in osteogenesis imperfecta type IV (Lobstein) with a low dose irradiation (10 x 1 Gy, respectively 6 x 1 Gy) under megavoltage conditions. RESULTS: After radiotherapy the children were painfree and the hyperplastic callus was considerably reduced. The previously immobilized patients could partly be mobilized. Thereby it could be contributed to the rehabilitation of the patients. New hyperplastic callus formation was not observed in the irradiated areas so far. CONCLUSION: Analogous to the successful radiation of heterotopic ossifications in other benign diseases radiation therapy seems to be a successful treatment of hyperplastic callus formation in osteogenesis imperfecta. Despite the late risks of radiotherapy radiation treatment of benign diseases in children might be indicated

Twenty patients undergoing three field head and neck radiation by Cobalt or 6 MV Linac had a total cord dose calculated from direct and scatter radiation. The cord was removed from the radiation field at tumor doses no higher than 4,400 cGy. Total tumor dose ranged from 5,400-7,400 cGy (mean 6060). All patients achieved the prescribed dose and none were lost to follow up (mean 36 months). It was found that scatter radiation can contribute as much as 20% extra dose to the spinal cord. Mean extra dose was 9% (range 1%-20%). This additional dose ranged from 52-810 cGy (mean 339 cGy). No apparent difference was seen with Cobalt or Linac source. Our conclusion was that significant additional dose is delivered to the spinal cord by scatter radiation and that scatter may contribute more to the development of myelopathy than previously believed

In the majority of cases, it occurs against a background of hepatitis B or C viral infection and/or liver cirrhosis, and is associated with a dismal prognosis of a few months. Current treatments in routine clinical practice are surgical resection and liver transplantation, but these therapies are applicable to only a small proportion of patients and prolongation of survival is restricted. Other treatment options include intra-arterial chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation, percutaneous ethanol injection, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, proton therapy, or a wide range of their possible combinations. The current lack of definitive data, however, limits the use of these therapies. Another option is gene therapy, which although in its infancy at the present time, may have a significant role to play in the future management of hepatocellular carcinoma. [References: 108]

METHODS: Among 249 patients with proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma, the authors identified 59 patients who had visual-field testing performed before treatment and at least 18 months after treatment. The visual fields, color fundus photographs, and charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of radiation papillopathy and visual-field loss after treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 59 patients reviewed (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of radiation papillopathy. Progressive visual-field loss, defined as enlargement of absolute scotoma of greater than [corrected] or equal to 30 degrees as compared with the pretreatment visual field, was noted in 67% of patients with radiation papillopathy and 73% of patients without papillopathy. In both groups, visual-field loss correlated with the area of the retina predicted to be exposed to irradiation in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive visual-field loss is common after proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma. However, the scotoma usually correlates with the area of the retina exposed to irradiation.

Due to the finite range and the sharpness of the dose gradients, the dose to well defined target volumes can be raised without excessive irradiation of non-target tissue. The prescribed proton doses are determined in part on the basis of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the particular radiation quality. In this study, RBE values were determined for a proton beam with a maximal range of 33 mm, which corresponds to an energy of approximately 67 MeV. The range modulated depth-dose distribution, with a 20 mm extended Bragg peak, was mainly designed for high precision treatment of small targets such as uveal melanomas. The tested cell lines, LS-174T and V79-379A, were chosen because of their suitability for clonogenic assays. The cells were irradiated with single doses in the range 2-10 Gy at different depths in the extended peak region of the range modulated proton beam. RBE values were determined by comparing the doses needed to obtain the same reduction in colony formation (0.5, 0.1 and 0.01) as with the reference 60Co gamma source. The mean RBE value was 1.22 with a standard deviation of 0.08. The variations depended on both cell type and on the survival levels considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS: 30 enucleated eyes were included for histopathological study and Ki-67 immunostaining. Patients were enucleated between 1991 and 1996 for uveal melanoma, 14 after proton beam irradiation and 16 without treatment (control group). The mean follow up period was 2.5 years after diagnosis and 1 year after enucleation. RESULTS: A significant relation was found between Ki-67 score and mitotic index (r = 0.56, p = 0.001), histological largest tumour diameter (r = 0.38, p = 0. 03), fibrosis (r = -0.35, p = 0.05), absence of tumoral pigmentation (p = 0.05), and presence of vascular thrombosis (p = 0.03). The Ki-67 score was significantly higher in the non-irradiated group (p = 0.01) and in the group of patients whose cause of enucleation was tumoral evolution (p = 0.005) compared with the group of patients enucleated after neovascular glaucoma. The Ki-67 score was very high in a case of orbital recurrence of uveal melanoma and metastatic death. 70% of metastasised tumours showed a Ki-67 score higher than the median value. CONCLUSION: Ki-67 labelling is a reliable method of estimating the proliferative activity in uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation. The Ki-67 score is significantly correlated with prognostic variables (mitotic index and histological largest tumour diameter), and with radiation effects after proton beam irradiation

A number of potentially useful modalities are under study including combinations of debulking surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, hypoxic cell sensitizers and radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and multiple daily fractionation of photon irradiation. Radiotherapy with pions, helium and heavier charged particles have several advantageous characteristics for accomplishing this goal. At the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) we have been studying the use of radiotherapy with helium and heavier charged particles which have several advantageous characteristics for delivery of cancerocidal therapy to deep seated tumors. These include greater localization of the radiation dose to the target volume as well as potentially greater tumor cell-killing potency relative to normal cell damage: A significant lessening of the radiation protective effect of hypoxia on tumor cells may be expected when radiation exposures are made with ions heavier than atomic number 10. Heavy ions also depress enzymatic repair mechanisms, decrease variations in radiosensitivity during the cell division cycle, cause greater than expected delay in cell division and decrease the protective effects of neighbouring cells in organized systems. A potential clinical advantage may result from irradiation with heavy ions in the atomic number range of 10-15 if a significant difference in the above parameters can be found between normal tissues and tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

In particular we considered the total survival rate according to tumor stage, the local tumor control and the period until relapse. 22% of the primarily irradiated patients achieved complete remission, 42% reached particular remission and 15% achieved minimal tumor remission (total response rate: 79%). Merely in 8% of the cases the tumor did not respond perceptibly. In the other cases irradiation had to be interrupted because of general worsening, or the patients got lost to post-therapeutical observation.

1	374	A technique of partial breast irradiation utilizing proton beam radiotherapy: comparison with conformal x-ray therapy.[see comment]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Heart, Humans, Immobilization, Immobilization/is [Instrumentation], Prone Position, Protons, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, Vacuum, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To develop a breast immobilization system and clinical technique to deliver partial breast irradiation with a proton beam and compare dose distributions using proton therapy and conformal x-rays. METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival

Although there are many reports concerning the tolerance of the CNS, few have examined individual substructures of the brain and fewer still have had detailed dose information. This study has both. A three dimensional planning system was used to develop the combined proton beam/photon beam treatments for 27 patients with skull-base tumors. The cranial nerves and their related nuclei were delineated on the planning CT scans and the radiation dose to each was determined from three dimensional dose distributions. In the 594 CNS structures (22 structures/patient in 27 patients), there have been 17 structures (in 5 patients) with clinically manifest radiation injury, after a mean follow-up time of 74 months (range 40-110 months). From statistical analyses, dose is found to be a significant predictor of injury. Using logistic regression analysis, we find that, for each cranial nerve, at 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) the complication rate is 1% (0.5-3% with 95% confidence) and that the 5% complication rate occurs at 70 CGE (64-81 CGE with 95% confidence). The slope of the dose response curve (at 50%) is 3.2 (2.2-5.4 with 95% confidence). No significant relationship between dose and latency period for nerve injury was found

Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

RIT can be used either to target tumor cells or to specifically suppress immunocompetent host cells in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. The choice of radionuclide used for RIT depends on its distinct radiation characteristics and the type of malignancy or cells targeted. Beta-emitters with their lower energy and longer path length are more suitable to target bulky, solid tumors whereas alpha-emitters with their high linear energy transfer and short path length are better suited to target hematopoietic cells (normal or malignant). Different approaches of RIT such as the use of stable radioimmunoconjugates or of pretargeting strategies are available. Encouraging results have been obtained with RIT in patients with hematologic malignancies. The results in solid tumors are somewhat less favorable but new strategies for patients with minimal residual disease using adjuvant and locoregional treatment are evolving. This report outlines basic principles of RIT, gives an overview of available radionuclides and radioimmunoconjugates, and discusses clinical results with special emphasis on their use in hematologic malignancies including use in conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation.

This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels.

All treatment plans are evaluated on the basis of biologically effective dose distributions. For therapy control, in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) and an online monitoring system for the beam intensity and position are used. The absence of a gantry restricts the treatment plans to horizontal beams. Most of the treatment plans consist of two nearly opposing lateral fields or sometimes orthogonal fields. In only a very few cases a single beam was used. For patients with very complex target volumes lateral and even distal field patching techniques were applied. Additional improvements can be achieved when the patient's head is fixed in a tilted position, in order to achieve sparing of the organs at risk. In order to test the stability of dose distributions in the case of patient misalignments we routinely simulate the effects of misalignments for patients with critical structures next to the target volume. The uncertainties in the range calculation are taken into account by a margin around the target volume of typically 2-3 mm, which can, however, be extended if the simulation demonstrates larger deviations. The novel TPS developed for scanned ion beams was introduced into clinical routine in December 1997 and was used for the treatment planning of 63 patients with head and neck tumours until July 2000. Planning strategies and methods were developed for this tumour location that facilitate the treatment of a larger number of patients with the scanned heavy ion beam in a clinical setting. Further developments aim towards a simultaneous optimization of the treatment field intensities and more effective procedures for the patient set-up. The results demonstrate that ion beams can be integrated into a clinical environment for treatment planning and delivery

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs.

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

The measurement of acoustic properties of melanomas in vivo has not yet been reported after proton-beam irradiation. This prospective study was conducted on a cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with primary malignant melanoma to assess in vivo the ability of quantitative echography to detect changes in choroidal malignant melanomas after proton-beam irradiation and to follow the ultrasonographic changes during 24 months posttreatment. Echographic evaluations of these patients were performed at diagnosis and repeated every 6 months after treatment over a 2-y period. The acoustic parameters included in this work are derived from the calibrated tissue backscatter spectra (spectral slope, spectral intercept and apparent integrated backscatter) of a selected tumor volume after correction of the apparatus transfer function and beam diffraction. Clinical parameters resulting from conventional echography were also quantified and included mainly tumor height, tumor vascularity and internal reflectivity. Spectral intercept and apparent integrated backscatter were found to be the most useful to evaluate changes in melanomas after treatment. Significant (p < 0.05) differences of these parameter values were observed between pre- and postproton therapy. In particular, significant changes (compared with baseline) were observed for these parameters, even when the tumor size after treatment was not significantly different from baseline. The results suggest that quantitative spectrum analysis of frequency-dependent backscatter can provide information about the structural modifications of choroidal malignant melanomas as a result of proton-beam irradiation

By dividing the target volume into two or more portions and using a combination of beams, a reasonably homogeneous irradiation of the target volume can be obtained which protects critical CNS structures from over-irradiation. This technique requires knowledge of the physical and biological effects of charged particles, precise, reproducible patient immobilization, careful treatment planning based upon Metrizamide contrast CT and/or MRI scanning, compensation for tissue inhomogeneities, and accurate, verifiable radiation delivery. Uncertainties in the dose distribution must be taken into account when prescribing treatment. We have used this technique in 47 patients with a variety of tumors abutting the brain stem and spinal cord, including chordoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, osteosarcoma and metastatic tumors. The results have shown a significant local control rate (62%) and the incidence of serious complications has been acceptable (13%). The median follow-up is 20 months with a range of 6-90 months. We conclude that charged particles can be safely and effectively used to irradiate lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord to doses higher than can be achieved with low-LET irradiation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

This is especially true when treating deep-seated tumors located below the clavicle. In proton beam radiotherapy at the University of Tsukuba, we ristrict the margins around the target volume. Therefore, special care in field localization and verification is needed, and we make it a rule to take X-ray pictures on each treatment day. To accomplish this, we have developed a localize-and-verify system by using fluoroscopic techniques and combining it with a real-time digital image processing device. This allows for the formation of a digital image of the proton field and storage it in the optic disc. By using this system as well as verification films, filed placement errors were measured in 10 patients with deep-seated tumors. Out of a total of 190 localizations, 22% exhibited a field placement error of more than 5 mm, where patient positioning and field localization were done by using skin drawings aligned with laser beams. This result strongly suggests the necessity for daily localization and verification of radiation fields, as is being done by us, for precision in the execution of proton beam radiation therapy

Proton bombarding in cyclotron has brought the radioactivity. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) investigation has been completed in 10 patients. The angiographies performed at 6 months revealed restenosis > 50% in five cases (50%). IVUS analysis demonstrated an absence of remodeling behind the stent, with no changes in total vessel volume (TVV; 353.6 +/- 126.3 and 343.9 +/- 90.6 mm(3)) or plaque + media volume (PMV; 171.7 +/- 57.4 and 166.8 +/- 42.6 mm(3)). On the other hand, lumen volume (LV) within the stent decreased significantly from 181.9 +/- 80.2 to 154.6 +/- 45.2 mm(3) (P < 0.02). This was due to presence of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) at both extremities of implanted stents. No chronic recoil of the implanted stents was found. The analysis of edges (5 mm distally and proximally to the last stent struts) showed no significant changes in TVV (187.3 +/- 62.60 and 176.9 +/- 53.5 mm(3)), but PMV increase significantly from 61.9 +/- 31.2 to 82.2 +/- 43.4 mm(3) (P < 0.04) and LV decreased from 125.2 +/- 40.7 to 94.7 +/- 22.0 mm(3) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, single (55)Co radioactive beta-emitting stents with high initial activity are effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia only within the stent body, as measured by IVUS, and they do not solve the problem of restenosis at the stent extremities as well as at the stent edges. Edge restenosis in this high radioactive stents was mainly (from 66%) due to neointimal proliferation. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc

Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

It has been suggested that conformal x-ray techniques using dynamically shaped beams with a moving radiation source would offer advantages compared to the use of only circular beams. It is also thought that, generally, charged particle beams such as protons offer dose deposition advantages compared to x-ray beams. A comparison of dose distributions was made between a small number of discrete proton beams, multiple-arc circular x-ray beams, and conformal x-ray techniques. Treatment planning of a selection of radiosurgery cases was done for these three techniques. Target volumes ranged from 1.0-25.0 cm3. Dose distributions and dose volume histograms of the target and surrounding normal brain were calculated. The advantages and limitations of each technique were primarily dependent upon the shape and size of the target volume. In general, proton dose distributions were superior to x-ray distributions; both shaped proton and shaped x-ray beams delivered dose distributions which were more conformal than x-ray techniques using circular beams; and the differences between all proton and x-ray distributions were negligible for the smallest target volumes, and greatest for the larger target volumes

Because the procedure is performed without a rigid frame, the precision of dose alignment can be affected by patient movement. Movement is limited by noninvasive restraints and compensated by remeasuring the target position at short intervals throughout treatment and then realigning the beam. Frameless image-guided radiosurgery has been used at our institution to treat 250 cranial, 23 spinal, 9 lung, and 3 pancreas cases involving malignant and benign tumors as well as vascular malformations. We have analyzed the target position records for all of these cases to assess the frequency, magnitude, and case-by-case patterns of patient movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The position of the treatment site during image-guided radiosurgery was measured at approximately 1-2-min intervals, on average, using orthogonal amorphous silicon X-ray cameras and an image registration process that determined all six degrees of freedom in the target's position. The change in position from one measurement to the next was indicative of patient movement. RESULTS: The treatment site position along each axis of translation was observed to vary by an average of 0.45 mm for the cranium, 0.53 mm for the cervical spine, 0.53 mm for the lumbar and thoracic spine, 1.06 mm for the lung, and 1.50 mm for the pancreas. Half of all cranial cases showed systematic drifting of the target away from the initial setup position. CONCLUSION: Using noninvasive restraints and supports, short-term movement of the head and spine during image-guided radiosurgery was limited to a radius of 0.8 mm, which satisfies the prevailing standard for radiosurgical dose alignment precision, but maintaining this margin of error throughout a treatment fraction requires regular monitoring of the target site's position

The feasibility of an IMRT technique which allows treatment of the complete target volume, including the primary tumor and lymph nodes, without a beam split is described. PATIENT AND METHOD: For inverse treatment planning, the KonRad planning system was used. The primary as well as the secondary PTV (bilateral lymph node levels) were treated with one intensity-modulated primary plan. To increase the dose in the primary PTV and suspicious lymph nodes, an intensity-modulated boost plan was performed. The "step and shoot" IMRT technique was used. A plan comparison between the described IMRT approach and an IMRT approach using a split-beam technique was performed focusing on the treatment time. A patient with a carcinoma of the nasopharynx was treated with curative intent by a combined radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: The median total dose to the primary PTV was 70 Gy, to suspicious lymph nodes > or = 66.0 Gy, and to the secondary PTV 52 Gy. The defined maximum doses to the organs at risk were not exceeded, and the median dose to the protected parotid gland amounted to 21 Gy. Comparison of the treatment time between both IMRT approaches revealed only a slightly shorter treatment time (1-3 min) for the split-beam IMRT technique without considering the remaining conventional treatment parts of the split-beam IMRT technique. The patient achieved a complete response, and 18 months after treatment no signs of recurrent disease are visible. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT allows the treatment of the target volumes with high doses combined with an excellent sparing of the organs at risk. The IMRT approach presented here makes the treatment of the whole target volume with a single-beam arrangement feasible and does not increase the treatment time compared to a split-beam IMRT technique. Treatment time was comparable to a conventional three-field technique combined with electrons. This IMRT technique can prevent over- or underdosage at field matchlines in the head and neck region and, moreover, is able to spare parotid glands and therefore better avoid xerostomia compared to conventional techniques

DESIGN: The study design was a nonrandomized, retrospective clinical study. Semiparametric and nonparametric statistical techniques were used. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred sixty-six posterior uveal melanoma patients were studied. INTERVENTION: Either iodine-125 plaque or helium ion radiation therapy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local tumor recurrence and systemic metastasis were measured. RESULTS: Local tumor recurrence was detected in 66 (8.6%) of 766 irradiated tumors. The 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 10%. The recurrence pattem was horizontal/marginal in 27 patients (41%) and vertical/diffuse in 39 patients (59%). Systemic metastasis was detected in 5 patients (19%) with horizontal/marginal recurrence and in 19 patients (49%) with vertical/diffuse recurrence. After known metastatic risk factors were controlled, the relative risk for metastasis was 2.2 for horizontal/marginal recurrence and 5.1 for vertical/diffuse recurrence (P = 0.05). The actuarial rate of systemic metastasis was 2.9% per year for all patients, 6.3% per year for patients with horizontal/marginal recurrence, and 15.5% per year for patients with vertical/diffuse recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Postirradiation local recurrence of posterior uveal melanoma is a risk factor for systemic metastasis. Vertical/diffuse recurrences may be associated more strongly with metastatic disease than horizontal/marginal recurrences

1	579	Outcomes of surgery for resection of regions of symptomatic radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations	Adult, California, Female, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/ra [Radiography], Radiation Injuries/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Research, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: Although radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), including radiation necrosis (RN), is often treated with surgical resection, detailed outcome data are lacking after resection of symptomatic radiation-injured regions with imaging characteristics suspicious for RN after SRS for arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 24 children treated between 1986 and 1994, no head fixation was applied and boost irradiation was not based on individual radiation treatment planning. Since 1995, boost irradiation has been assisted by CT-based individual radiation treatment planning and ORFIT head fixation in 59 patients. The influence of various factors including age, sex, tumor location, extent, type of surgery, risk group, radiation dose to posterior fossa and spinal axis, and the effect of head fixation and CT-assisted radiation treatment planning on 5-year relapse-free and 5-year overall survival was investigated. RESULTS: Overall and relapse-free survival rates for all 83 patients were 73.5% and 60.7%. Univariate analysis identified metastatic disease (p = 0.034) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.013) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Relapse-free survival rates were influenced by metastatic disease (p = 0.028) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.009). On multivariate analysis, metastatic disease (p = 0.04) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.045) were significant factors for overall and relapse-free survival (p = 0.036 and p = 0.041) as well. CONCLUSION: Metastatic disease appears to be correlated with a worse prognosis in this analysis. Individual radiation treatment planning and head fixation have a positive impact on survival. For postoperative radiotherapy of the posterior fossa, the application of head fixation and individual CT-based radiation treatment planning is considered indispensable in each case

Routine one-month follow-up documented disappearance of the tumour in 16 patients, with resolution of the oedema and ventricular shift. Shrinkage of the metastasis occurred in 51 patients. In 9 patients the tumour remained stable, in 7 there was progression of tumour size. Among the patients showing shrinkage of the tumour or unchanged tumour volume, repeated radiosurgery resulted in disappearance of the metastasis in 5 and further shrinkage in 28. In 14 patients routine stereotactic CT follow-up study led to the detection of a new metastasis, again treated with excellent results. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients and radiation necrosis in the target area in 5 patients. Radiosurgery thus proves to be an appropriate alternative to surgery. The versatility of our non-invasive and painless method permits CT staging (which we consider essential) without hospitalization of the patient	
1	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option

The proton beam, generated via a combination of Van de Graaff accelerator and cyclotron, is prepared by passive shaping for conformal tumor irradiation. A digital X-ray verification of the tumor location with the patient in sitting position limits the position uncertainties to a maximum of 0.3 mm. The treatment planning is performed using the program EYEPLAN. OCTOPUS, a CT-based planning program developed in cooperation with the German Cancer Research Center of Heidelberg, is under pre-clinical testing. Thus far, more than 400 patients have been irradiated. The first results are comparable to those obtained in other proton therapy centers. At the end of 2002, the University Hospital of Essen has also become a cooperation partner of the Hahn-Meitner Institute

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled	
1	1965	Quality management of medical physics issues at the German heavy ion therapy project	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Calibration, Germany, Heavy Ions, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Physics, Quality Control, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Time Factors	For the commissioning and operation of the German Heavy Ion Therapy Project a quality assurance program was developed and successfully applied. The complete radiotherapy process using heavy ions was carefully analyzed and divided into three areas related to beam delivery and control, safety-interlock system and medical physics issues. In this paper, the medical physics issues are addressed. Since the irradiation with heavy ions is a nonstandard modality, new concepts and ion specific tests were developed. As far as possible, national and international standard specifications for radiotherapy were adopted. For each aspect, a performance characteristic and a corresponding acceptance test were introduced. In addition, test characteristics for the constancy tests were established. For all tests, intervention thresholds and test frequencies were specified. Using the described protocol of acceptance tests, the commissioning was passed successfully. The heavy ion irradiation facility was approved by the governmental authorities on the basis of these test results. During clinical operation, constancy tests are performed at the beginning of each treatment period, in order to maintain the quality found during the acceptance tests. Up to now, 48 patients have been treated within 6 treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The concepts used and the tests developed for the quality assurance program may serve as an example of how to introduce systematically a quality assurance program for a new treatment modality

Moderate to severe losses were noted in patients producing voice with all types of alaryngeal modalities: tracheoesophageal, esophageal, and electrolaryngeal. Voice and speech losses were related to the impaired motility and vibratory capability of the esophageal wall and mucosa, to fibrosis of the submandibular region and to trismus. Tracheoesophageal and esophageal voice was recovered some weeks after completion of irradiation. No voice losses were observed in alaryngeal speakers who did not undergo voice restoration until after irradiation. All irradiated patients also showed various degrees of dysphagia during the treatment

Currently in use at nearly 80 institutions, over 8000 patients have been treated using the system. Peacock treatments have been delivered to sites throughout the body, including CNS, head & neck, prostate, liver, kidney, lung, mediastinum, and extremities. IMRT, however, is a young and rapidly evolving treatment methodology. As institutions have explored new ways of improving radiation therapy with intensity-modulated techniques, the requirements for the Peacock system have also expanded. More sophisticated planning algorithms have been implemented to satisfy these new requirements, as well as better tools for treatment verification and quality assurance. In addition, new delivery techniques are being examined to improve the ability of IMRT to increase target volume doses while limiting organ-at-risk doses. One such technique, using helical tomotherapy (Peacock is an example of sequential tomotherapy), is currently being evaluated at one institution. Both techniques use narrow, modulated delivery beams. However, helical tomotherapy requires continuous movement of the couch during radiation, similar to helical CT. This work reviews the development of tomotherapy with the Peacock system. It then looks at current IMRT treatment techniques using tomotherapy, and how the field has broadened since the first treatments were delivered. Finally, it looks at the future of tomotherapy techniques, and how these techniques will adapt to the changing requirements for radiation therapy

1	1028	Audiologic and treatment outcomes after linear accelerator-based stereotactic irradiation for acoustic neuroma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Audiometry, Follow-Up Studies, Hearing, Humans, Hydrocephalus/et [Etiology], Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/rt [Radiotherapy], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/ae [Adverse Effects], Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: Although surgical excision is the traditional treatment modality for acoustic neuroma, radiotherapy (RT) is gaining momentum as an alternative. This is particularly evident in patients with useful hearing, in whom fractionated RT offers the potential for hearing preservation. Our objective was to determine the disease control, hearing preservation (via audiograms), and toxicity rates after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiation for acoustic neuroma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 72 acoustic neuroma patients underwent stereotactic irradiation and had at least 6 months of follow-up between October 1997 and March 2002. Of these, 45 received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 27 received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Before treatment, all SRS patients were functionally deaf and 23 of 25 SRT patients had useful hearing in the affected ear. The minimal peripheral dose was 12 Gy and 45 Gy in all SRS and SRT patients, respectively. Tumor control, toxicity, and hearing preservation were recorded. RESULTS: The median follow-up in the SRS and SRT groups was 27 and 26 months, respectively. No tumor progression was seen after SRS and SRT. On the basis of the audiogram criteria, the 1-year and 2-year hearing preservation rate was 85% and 57%, respectively. The mean pre- and post-SRT speech recognition threshold was 20 and 38 dB, respectively. The mean proportion of pre- and post-SRT speech discrimination was 91% and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic RT achieves good local control, with acceptable toxicity. RT fractionation appears to provide encouraging rates of hearing preservation

From December 1984 to December 1989, 100 patients were treated 86 of them are now evaluable. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range: 9-69). Surgery was abdomino-perineal resection in 33 cases and anterior resection in 53 cases. Radiotherapy was preoperative pelvic irradiation, with a single 500-Gy fraction, the day before surgery. To stages B2, C1 and C2 patients (Astler and Coller) postoperative radiotherapy was administered for a total dose of 4500 Gy (180 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/week), with box technique, from a Co 60 unit or Linear Accelerator (photon 18 MV). Preliminary results indicate 8% (7/86) local recurrences and 9.3% (8/86) distant metastases. Five-year actuarial disease-free survival is 63.2% +/- 8 for stage B1, 55.6% +/- 19 for stage B2, and 40.2% +/- 13 for stages C1 + C2. Overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 53% +/- 10. No lethal or severe complications were observed following treatment

At McGill University, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is given with a linear accelerator-based dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery unit. The first treatment is given using the stereotactic frame for target localization and head immobilization. Subsequent treatments are given using skin tattoos and laser alignment for target placement within the isocenter of the linear accelerator, and a modified portable halo-ring device is used for skull immobilization. Typically, a marginal dose of 42 Gy was prescribed at the margins of the lesion, divided in 6 fractions and given over a 2-week period. We report the pathological profile and treatment results in a series of 21 patients with a variety of intracranial tumors, treated in this manner between May 1987 and April 1990. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be a worthwhile procedure for the treatment of well-selected patients with intracranial neoplasms

At NIRS, 2,129 patients were treated with d(30 MeV)+Be neutrons between 1975 and 1994. There were 274 patients referred for the treatment with P(50.5 MeV)+Be neutrons at KCCH during the period of 1986 through 1992. Unfortunately, fast neutron therapy performed at IMS was discontinued in 1991, where 458 patients had been treated with d(14 MeV)+Be neutrons since 1976. At NIRS, a vertical beam with multileaf collimator system was used for treatment of patients referred. The results showed that local control rates were 79% (19/24), 53% (14/26), and 89.3% (50/56) for carcinoma of the salivary gland, osteogenic sarcoma and carcinoma of the prostate, while complications for those were found to be 8.8, 8.3 and 17.8%, respectively. In the treatment of carcinoma of the lung, results were better for patients with adenocarcinoma than those with squamous cell carcinoma. Of 32 patients suffering from Pancoast tumor, 14 achieved local control, whereas 2 of 32 patients developed complications. On the other hand, salvage surgery was required in the treatment of malignant melanoma. In the treatment of malignant glioma, dose localization has to be improved in the target area to confirm local control. Experiences performed at KCCH have shown that, of 53 patients suffering from unresectable primary or recurrent rectal carcinomas, 28 achieved local control. It was concluded from the experiences with fast neutrons in Asian countries that adenocarcinomas as well as slowly growing tumors are indications for fast neutrons and that dose localization has to be improved in order to advance high LET radiation therapy. Clinical trials with 70 MeV protons started at NIRS in 1979, where the aim of study has been focused on treatment of choroidal melanoma, whereas, at Tsukuba University, 250 MeV protons have been used in the treatment of tumors deeply seated. Based on experiences of fast neutrons and protons, clinical trials with heavy ions initiated at NIRS in October 1994. Clinical studies with high LET radiations will be performed by using heavy ions in order to pursue indications of particle radiation therapy

METHODS: 54 patients after with malignant brain tumor (44 cases of glioblastoma, 10 other high-grade gliomas) were examined post-surgically in a total of 140 proton MRS examinations in the course of radiotherapy and in follow-up controls. Fast SI acquisition was performed as single-slice or double-slice TSI sequence with 32 x 32 phase encodings within 11 or 15 minutes, respectively. SVS with TR/TE 2000/272 ms yielded relative metabolite ratios, and in 15 patients the time courses of the absolute concentrations of brain metabolites were also determined. RESULTS: In the group of 44 patients that could be tracked by MRS until therapy completion, TSI localized in 23 patients a persistent or newly arisen distinct choline accumulation indicating residual or recurrent tumor after radiation therapy. In all these cases MRS diagnosis was confirmed histologically or by short-term follow-up. However, in 6 of 15 patients showing a normal choline pattern in the TSI acquisition, tumor recurrence appeared within three months. SVS provided early recognition of recurrent tumor when detecting characteristic alterations of metabolite concentrations oin therapy follow-up. CONCLUSION: TSI and SVS represent complementary MRS techniques and are able to diagnose tumor recurrence early and unambiguously in cases where focal choline accumulation is detected

The beam was adequately filtered and angled in order to create dual fields. The uniformity of the dose distribution to the patient was 10%. The relative dosimetry of the dual beam was performed using a silicon diode and an ionization chamber in a standard water phantom. X-Omat V films were irradiated in a cylindrical PMMA phantom in order to obtain the dose distribution for the six TSET dual fields used in the treatment. Absolute dosimetry was carried out with a calibrated ionization chamber placed in a cylindrical water phantom. The dose contribution per monitor unit of the single dual beams was determined with this method

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart

The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart	
1	1161	Radiation necrosis and brain edema association with CyberKnife treatment	Adult, Aged, Brain Edema/di [Diagnosis], Brain Edema/et [Etiology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Female, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Risk, Risk Factors, Robotics, Stereotaxic Techniques/ae [Adverse Effects], Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,Emission-Computed,Single-Photon	The CyberKnife (CK) is a frameless and image guided robotic controlled instrument for stereotactic irradiation. The authors studied CK treatment of glioma and glioblastoma, and analyzed frequency and risk factors of radiation necrosis. Of 61 patients with glioma and glioblastoma treated with CyberKnife, four patients showed symptomatic radiation necrosis. All of these patients were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, varying from 3 to 6 fractions without previous radiation therapy. Two patients required necrotomy through craniotomy. Two patients were treated conservatively. Our four patients with radiation necrosis were not specific in terms of tumor volume and dose delivery. Glioma cells invade the normal brain tissue and over-radiation to this intermingling area is one of the risk factors for injury to normal endothelial cells. The homogeneity of the maximum dose area is an important factor to reduce over radiation to the normal brain parenchyma. The dose volume effect has been discussed in terms of risk factor; however, the number of fractions and dose per fraction should be considered to avoid radiation necrosis. We consider that conformal treatment with inverse algorism, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and precise anatomic targeting reduce the risk of radiation necrosis

This study analyzes relapse and survival in a community-based population with L-SCLC according to age and comorbidity. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 174 patients with L-SCLC referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre, between January 1991 and December 1999. Patient and treatment characteristics, disease response, relapse, and survival were compared among three age cohorts: <65 years (n = 55, 32%), 65-74 years (n = 76, 44%), and > or =75 years (n = 43, 25%); and according to Charlson comorbidity scores 0, 1, and > or =2. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with treatment response and survival. RESULTS: Patient factors that significantly differed with age were functional status classified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and number of comorbidities. Increasing age was significantly associated with fewer diagnostic scans. Combined modality chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was given in 86%, 66%, and 40% of patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively, (p <0.0001). Thoracic irradiation use was comparable among the age cohorts (p >0.05), but chemotherapy use varied significantly with less intensive regimens, fewer cycles, and lower total doses with advancing age (p <0.05). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was used in 41 patients, only 3 of whom were age >70 years. Overall response rates to primary treatment significantly decreased with advancing age: 91%, 79%, and 74% in patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively (p = 0.014). Treatment toxicity and relapse patterns were similar across the age cohorts. Overall 2-year survival rates were significantly lower with advancing age: 37%, 22%, and 19% (p = 0.003), with corresponding median survivals of 17, 12, and 7 months among patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age and Charlson comorbidity scores were not significantly associated with treatment response and survival. Independent prognostic factors favorably associated with survival were good performance status, normal lactate dehydrogenase, absence of pleural effusion, and > or =four cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity. Older patients with L-SCLC were less likely to be treated with CRT, intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Treatment response and survival rates were lower with advancing age, but this may be attributed to poor performance status and suboptimal treatment rather than age. [References: 31]

The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate cancer incidence from dose distributions. For this purpose, target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity-modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. The cancer incidence has been derived from the mean doses for each organ. The results of this work are: (a) Intensity-modulated treatment of Hodgkin's disease using nine photon fields (15 MV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with two opposed photon fields (6 MV). (b) Intensity-modulated treatment using nine proton fields (maximum energy 177.25 MeV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with one proton field (160 MeV). (c) Irradiation with protons using the spot scanning technique decreases the avoidable cancer incidence compared to photon treatment by a factor of about two. This result is independent of the number of beams used. Our work suggests that there are radiotherapy indications in which intensity-modulated treatments will result in little or no reduction of cancer incidence compared to conventional treatments. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment

DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed

1	121	Stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous malformations: Kjellberg's experience with proton beam therapy in 98 cases at the Harvard Cyclotron.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Cerebral Hemorrhage/ep [Epidemiology], Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Child, Cyclotrons, Female, Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pp [Physiopathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Nervous System/pp [Physiopathology], Postoperative Complications/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation Injuries, Radiosurgery, Retrospective Studies, Seizures/ep [Epidemiology], Seizures/et [Etiology], Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: The lack of treatment options for surgically inaccessible cavernous malformations has made radiosurgery a possible alternative to conservative management. The few previous reports of radiosurgical efficacy have been limited by small numbers, short follow-up, or lack of attention to the full spectrum of end points, including neurological disability. In an attempt to elucidate the risk-to-benefit ratio of radiosurgery for cavernous malformations, we undertook a retrospective analysis of of 95 patients with 98 lesions treated by the late Raymond N. Kjellberg. METHODS: Patients were followed for an average of 5.4 years (range, 0.3-12.3 yr), and data regarding hemorrhage, seizure, neurological disability, and incidence of radiation-induced complications were gathered. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a drop in annual hemorrhage rates from 17.3% per lesion per year before treatment to 4.5% per lesion per year after a latency period of 2 years. Improvement in seizure control was evident. However, a 16% incidence of permanent neurological deficit and a 3% mortality rate were attributable to radiographically confirmed radiation-induced complications. Neurological disability scores, measured by the modified Rankin disability scale, indicated a significant decline in neurological functioning during the follow-up interval, a result of the combined effects of radiation-related injury, hemorrhage, and clinical progression of the lesion. CONCLUSION: We conclude that although radiosurgery does seem to reduce hemorrhage, there is potential for complications and continued lesion progression after radiosurgery. These risks and benefits must be carefully balanced against the natural history of untreated lesions if the use of radiosurgery is considered

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

1	2420	Current developments in proton therapy: a review. [Review] [85 refs]	Engineering, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiobiology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The use of high-energy protons in radiotherapy was first proposed in 1946. In the last decade there has been a significant growth in the number of centres using protons in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disease. To date (January 1993) a total of more than 11,500 patients have been treated world-wide. Encouraging clinical results have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this article is to outline the advantages of proton beams and to review current developments in physics and engineering applied to the field of proton therapy with particular emphasis on proton accelerator technology and the development of proton therapy facilities. The production of clinically useful beams is discussed and the relative merits of different treatment systems compared. Reference is also made to the factors affecting the absorbed dose in a patient and to proton radiobiology together with the results of studies of comparisons of treatment planning with protons with that using conventional photon therapy.

METHODS: The literature was reviewed regarding recent research in the therapy of lung cancer. Emphasis was placed on newer radiation therapy (RT) techniques. RESULTS: Advances in physics and computer technology have improved radiation delivery systems. New strategies have been used, such as altered fractionation patterns, three-dimensional treatment planning, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), tomotherapy, stereotactic RT, and heavy ion RT. New technologies will make it possible to administer higher doses more precisely, which should result in better disease control, with less toxicity. CONCLUSION: Further research will improve the outcome of patients with lung cancer by providing more effective tools for the RT of this disease. [References: 41]

Tumors of the same histology and TNM stage were compared after different treatments. Prior to this comparative study tumor volume changes and halving time were tested for judging the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment of 765 patients with lung metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor volume was determined by CT planimetry before and after radiotherapy in 56 tumor patients (42 lung tumors, 14 thyroid tumors). The rate of regression, i.e., the halving time was calculated on the basis of exponential curve. Fourteen thyroid tumor patients given telecobalt and photon irradiation for post-operative recurrence formed a separate group of patients. Halving time was determined at 30-day intervals, the values were qualified as "fast", "moderately fast", "moderately slow" and "slow". RESULTS: Partial remission rate of patients treated by telecobalt irradiation was not higher than 60%, accompanied by fast halving time. With those receiving photon irradiation, however, partial remission reached even 70%, also with a fast halving time. In both groups minimal remission was associated with moderately fast halving time. The partial remission of recurring thyroid tumor patients receiving telecobalt irradiation was partly fast, partly moderately fast. Their minimal remission data developed with a moderately fast halving time, although chemotherapy subsequent to radiotherapy did not result in regression. CONCLUSION: Appraisal of radiotherapeutic efficacy is based on the simultaneous monitoring of decrease in tumor volume (%) and halving time. It is to be stressed that neither the planimetric volume determination nor the halving time data can be taken as absolute values, since they are subject to other factors. In authors opinion, the most effective methods of the following of the tumor regression is the planimetric volume measurement calculated by CT, in the clinical praxis in recent time

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis with multivariate analysis using life tables and Cox proportional hazard models in addition to other nonparametric techniques. PATIENTS: All patients with a noncataractous other eye and adequate dosimetry data who were treated with helium ion irradiation. RESULTS: Significant cataracts (grade 3+ or 4+ on a 0 to 4+ scale) developed in 129 patients (44%). The risk of cataract development peaked at 3 years (25% per person-year) and then declined to a sustained level of 7% to 9% per year after 7 years. In multivariate analysis, the percentage of lens included in the treatment port was the predominant predictive correlate with time to significant cataract (relative risk of 2.97 for a 25% increase in the percentage of lens in the treatment port). Patient age, preexisting cortical opacity, and ultrasound tumor height were also significant; ciliary body involvement and tumor dose had smaller effects. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated an increased rate of cataractogenesis with each increment of the percentage of lens in the treatment port; when more than half of the lens was in the beam, the risk of cataract exceeded 90% within 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Cataract development after helium ion irradiation is a function of the amount of the lens in the beam. Unlike neovascular glaucoma that develops mainly in the first few years after treatment, cataract continues to develop during the entire length of follow-up

Comparable cytogenetic abnormalities have also been demonstrated in non-clonal cultures of alpha-irradiated primary human bone marrow, but a different pattern of delayed aberrations, mainly of chromosome-type, was found after X-irradiation in non-clonal cultures. In clonal analyses, delayed apoptotic cell death was evident after both X- and alpha-irradiation. It is suggested that the type of radiation exposure, the type of cell and its genetically determined susceptibility are factors that may influence the expression of delayed effects of radiation

This technique divides the target into two parts, one partially surrounding the critical structure (brain stem or spinal cord) and a second excluding the critical structure and abutting the first portion of the target. Compensators are used to conform the dose distribution to the distal surface of the target. This technique represents a novel approach in treating unresectable or residual tumors surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. Since the placement of the patient with respect to beam-shaping devices is critical for divided-target treatments, a method for calculating dose distributions reflecting random patient motion is proposed, and the effects of random patient motion are studied for two divided-target patient examples. Dose-volume histograms and a normal-tissue complication probability model are used in this analysis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation.

Life expectancy following conservative treatment is equal to or better than that following enucleation. This is demonstrated by nonrandomized comparative studies, and by the authors' own long-term results following the conservative treatment of melanomas by 60Co applicators: mortality due to metastases of small melanomas was 3% (V = smaller than 10 x 10 x 3 mm), with medium-size melanomas it was 12% (V = 10 x 10 x 3-15 x 15 x 5 mm), and with large melanomas 21% (V = larger than 15 x 15 x 5 mm). Accelerated proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas is currently the method of choice for the conservative treatment of uveal melanomas. The sharp boundaries of the irradiated zone, the uniformly distributed irradiation dose, and beam-splitting are the main advantages of this technique. During the last three years, 310 cases of uveal melanoma have been treated in Switzerland with an accelerated proton beam. Of these, 214 were followed up for more than one year. Eight patients (3.9%) died of metastases. Visual acuity was identical or superior to initial visual acuity in 60.3% of the cases, while 39.6% exhibited a deterioration of vision or a functional loss. Favorable results achieved by conservative treatment of uveal melanomas considerably limited the indications for enucleation, which is now only performed in exceptional situations

The proposed fractionation strategy consisted of a SIB treatment following a first phase of conventional fractionation to the elective volume (named SEQ/SIB). The novel method was compared to a conventional sequential fractionation and to a full SIB approach. Treatment plans were designed for five patients on the proton planning system developed for spot scanning at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Villigen (CH). Three to five beams were applied for all plans and fractionations. All effective dose distributions were corrected using biological models to take into account repopulation and time at repopulation onset. Corrected and uncorrected plans were compared on the basis of dosimetry criteria and dose-volume histograms. The results showed a dosimetric advantage for the SEQ/SIB approach in terms of target coverage, without significant disadvantages for risk structures and healthy tissue. Considering the high logistic impact and the limited availability of radiation facilities, the clinical exploitation of accelerated SIB treatment with protons appears promising

Over the past 25 years several advances have been made in the management of uveal melanoma. Research in the pathobiology of cancer metastasis in general and uveal melanoma in particular has also provided new insights. In this review, the Zimmerman-McLean-Foster hypothesis is explored in the light of current clinical, epidemiological, statistical, and experimental evidence. [References: 54]

Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range: 14-85 years), were treated at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), France, using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range: 60-70 CGE). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 4-71 months), the 3-year local control rates were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates 88% and 75%, respectively. 14 tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical target volume [CTV], and two without further assessment). Seven patients died from their tumor and another one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and, similarly, the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age < or = 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter < 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV < 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on local control. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure. In two thirds of the cases, relapses are located in the GTV. Maximum diameter, GTV, and age are prognostic indicators of local control. These results should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range: 14-85 years), were treated at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), France, using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range: 60-70 CGE). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 4-71 months), the 3-year local control rates were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates 88% and 75%, respectively. 14 tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical target volume [CTV], and two without further assessment). Seven patients died from their tumor and another one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and, similarly, the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age < or = 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter < 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV < 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on local control. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure. In two thirds of the cases, relapses are located in the GTV. Maximum diameter, GTV, and age are prognostic indicators of local control. These results should be confirmed during a longer follow-up	
1	1667	Applicability of a mobile accelerator for intraoperative radiation therapy to colorectal cancer	Adult, Aged, Colorectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Colorectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Costs and Cost Analysis, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Pain, Particle Accelerators, Patient Selection, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Survival Analysis, United States	PURPOSE: Intraoperative radiation therapy is reportedly effective for local control and pain relief in colorectal cancer. However, this treatment requires a large number of medical personnel, which hinders expanded use of this method. A mobile electron linear accelerator for intraoperative radiation therapy has been developed and is now commercially available. This report analyzes the applicability of this accelerator to colorectal cancer. The applicability of the mobile accelerator is analyzed based on its specifications by simulating the intraoperative radiation therapy delivered to these patients with a conventional intraoperative radiation therapy unit. METHODS: From 1987 to 1999, 49 colorectal cancer patients underwent 54 surgical resections and received intraoperative radiation therapy to 75 sites. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative radiation therapy dose for colorectal cancer with the conventional unit was 22 (range, 10-30) Gy. The mean electron energy level was 10 (range, 3-30) MEV. Applicator size ranged from 4 to 10 cm in diameter. The mobile accelerator can achieve a dose rate of 10 Gy/min and an applicator unit size range of 3 to 10 cm in diameter, facilitating intraoperative radiation therapy for colorectal cancer. The electron energy limitation (12 MEV at maximum) suggests that the indications for this machine are limited. In our experience, 30 percent of patients received intraoperative radiation therapy with electron energy levels exceeding 12 MEV. Of these cases, 81 percent had macroscopic residual tumor and 69 percent had pain. CONCLUSION: An intraoperative radiation therapy mobile accelerator can cover 72 percent of the irradiation sites covered using our conventional unit. This accelerator is useful for intraoperative radiation therapy with curative intent for patients with no or slight residual tumor. Patients with gross residual tumor and pain may not be suitable

Surgical management is the primary therapeutic modality. With the use of modern surgical techniques, recurrence is infrequent, and facial nerve sparing is the norm. However, for patients with recurrent disease, the risk of further relapses is increased with surgical resection alone, particularly for those patients in whom multiple recurrences have already occurred. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting remains uncertain. Although neutron radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy for malignant salivary gland tumors, its role in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas is less well defined. We report our experience using this modality for high-risk, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. METHODS: Sixteen patients were treated with neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands from 1986 through 1993. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11-77 years); median age at the time of neutron radiotherapy was 52 years (range, 22-77 years); median number of prior surgical procedures was 3 (range, 1-6); median duration from initial diagnosis to radiotherapy was 14.5 years (range, 3 months-30 years); median follow-up was 83 months (range, 9-144 months). The median period at risk for survivors was 96 months (defined as the interval from completion of neutron radiotherapy to last follow-up). Ten patients had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment as determined by imaging studies, with nine patients having multinodular disease. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial survival was 79%. One patient died from lung metastases 9 months after treatment; one patient died from a liver tumor of uncertain origin, but the histology could not rule out a metastasis from the previous pleomorphic adenoma; and one patient died from recurrent disease at the base of skull. The 15-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 85%. One of the two patients with locoregional recurrence had a malignant transformation into an adenocarcinoma. No statistical difference in 15-year actuarial survival (75% vs 83%, p =.82) was found comparing patients with gross residual disease vs microscopic residual disease. The actuarial 15-year locoregional control was 76% for patients with gross residual disease vs 100% for those with microscopic disease. The 15-year actuarial risk of RTOG/ESTRO nonaudiologic grade III/IV complications was 21%. No facial nerve injuries were observed as a direct consequence of neutron radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron radiotherapy offers both excellent local control rates and survival rates in patients with multiply recurrent pleomorphic adenomas that are not candidates for surgical resection, even in the presence of gross residual disease. The treatment-related morbidity is acceptable. Malignant transformations and metastases, although uncommon, may be observed in this tumor. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc

METHODS: Two patients initially diagnosed and treated for unilateral scleritis were referred for management of persistent inflammation. Additional evaluation uncovered underlying malignant processes. RESULTS: The first patient presented with scleritis initially responsive to systemic corticosteroids, with relapse one month later. Upon referral, peripheral fundus examination revealed elevated lesions. Additional studies confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The patient was treated with proton-beam irradiation. The second patient developed necrotizing scleritis unresponsive to systemic steroids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. A scleral biopsy disclosed an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma, likely metastatic. Exenteration was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis can present a diagnostic challenge. It is often the sole initial manifestation of an occult systemic problem. Treatment-resistant scleritis should raise the suspicion of an infectious or malignant masquerade

[Review] [58 refs]	Brachytherapy, Child, Dose Fractionation, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], France, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Research	There have been considerable technical improvements in radiation therapy for the past two decades. In children affected with cancer, these have been likely overshadowed by concommittant major chemotherapy-based advances, and at least in part ignored and misused. This article outlines principles, technological requirements, and clinical applications of innovations that aim at improving ballistical selectivity (such as conformal, intensity modulation, stereotactic photons, charged particles, and intraoperative therapies), as well as at influencing tumors and normal tissues sensitivity to radiations (such as high LET particles, and altered fractionations).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2).

Eighty-five brain metastases in 81 patients were investigated before treatment and 16-18h thereafter. Standard metabolic ratios, namely N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), phosphorylcholine/glycerophosphorylcholine (Cho)/Cr, NAA/Cho, lactate (Lac)/Cr, and mobile lipids (Lip)/Cr, were calculated, and comparison of their values before and after irradiation was done. No volumetric changes of any neoplasm were found in any case on the next day after treatment. At the same time, significant reduction of Cho/Cr (P < 0.001) and NAA/Cr (P < 0.01) ratios on the proton MRS of the tumor was disclosed. Reduction of Cho/Cr ratio was significantly more prominent in neoplasms with higher pretreatment Cho/Cr ratios (P < 0.001) and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (P < 0.01). Reduction of NAA/Cr ratio was predominantly determined by its pretreatment value (P < 0.001). The observed decrease of Cho/Cr ratio probably reflects inhibition of proliferative activity and early apoptotic cell loss, whereas reduction of NAA/Cr may result from radiation-induced modulation of neuronal activity in the peritumoral brain tissue. Serial proton MRS represents a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of metabolic changes in intracranial neoplasms after radiosurgical treatment

Reduction of Cho/Cr ratio was significantly more prominent in neoplasms with higher pretreatment Cho/Cr ratios (P < 0.001) and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (P < 0.01). Reduction of NAA/Cr ratio was predominantly determined by its pretreatment value (P < 0.001). The observed decrease of Cho/Cr ratio probably reflects inhibition of proliferative activity and early apoptotic cell loss, whereas reduction of NAA/Cr may result from radiation-induced modulation of neuronal activity in the peritumoral brain tissue. Serial proton MRS represents a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of metabolic changes in intracranial neoplasms after radiosurgical treatment

PBT has a half-century history, and more than 40,000 patients have been reported as having had treatments with proton beams worldwide. The historic change to this therapy occurred in the 1990s, when the Loma Linda University Medical Center began its clinical activity as the first hospital in the world to utilize a medically dedicated proton therapy facility. Since then, similar hospital-based medically dedicated facilities have been constructed. Results from around the world have shown the therapeutic superiority of PBT over alternative treatment options for ocular melanoma, skull base sarcoma, head & neck cancer, lung cancer,esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer. PBT is expected to achieve further advancement both clinically and technologically

However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects

METHODS: T3-4 rectal cancer patients received escalating doses of oxaliplatin (day 1 and 29) with a fixed dose of capecitabine of 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily (days 1-14, 25-38) added to RT with 50.4 Gy and surgery after 6-8 weeks. The MTD, determined during phase I, was used in the subsequent phase II, in which R0 resection rate (a negative circumferential resection margin) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were evaluable. In the phase I part, oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m(2) was established as MTD. In phase II, the main toxicity was grade III diarrhea (18%). All patients underwent surgery, and 20 patients had a resectable tumor. An R0 was achieved in 17/21 patients, downstaging to T0-2 in 7/21 and a pCR in 2/21. CONCLUSION: Combination of Capox-RT has an acceptable acute toxicity profile and a high R0 resection rate of 81% in locally advanced rectal cancer. However the pCR rate was low

No shoulder region was observed in the survival curve of the cells after N-ion irradiation. Ratios of D0 values before and after a 6-hour incubation in plateau phase were 1.1 and 1.8 for N-ion irradiation and gamma-ray irradiation, respectively. The results show that recovery after irradiation with high-LET radiation is slow and much less than after low-LET irradiation

Endoresection of the tumour after proton beam irradiation, is an alternative approach, aiming to reduce the incidence of ocular morbidity caused by tumour necrosis after sole radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with large uveal melanomas (mean tumour thickness: 9.1 mm, mean tumour volume: 0.77 cc), received a primary proton beam irradiation (60 CGE) and underwent subsequent endoresection via a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The median pretreatment visual acuity was 0.2. The mean follow-up was 13.9 months. RESULTS: The postoperative visual acuity after 12 months was 0.12 (median, mean visual acuity loss 0.08). The probability of developing radiation retinopathy or papillopathy within the first year after treatment was 35% and 28% respectively and the probability of enucleation was 9% within the first postoperative year. No tumour recurrences were observed and 2 patients developed liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Endoresection following irradiation of large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or the fovea seems to be a useful and safe alternative to the traditional irradiation or enucleation. The incidence of complications following our approach seems to be lower when compared to radiation alone, where tumour necrosis is a substantial problem

This report is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred and six patients in stages T2b (B2), T2c (B2), and T3 (C) were treated with 45 Gy photon-beam irradiation to the pelvis and an additional 30 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) to the prostate with 250-MeV protons, yielding a total prostate dose of 75 CGE in 40 fractions. Median follow-up time was 20.2 months (range: 10-30 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system; local control was evaluated by serial digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements. RESULTS: Morbidity evaluation was available on 104 patients. The actuarial 2-year rate of Grade 1 or 2 late morbidity was 12% (8% rectal, 4% urinary). No patients demonstrated Grade 3 or 4 late morbidity. Treatment response was evaluated on 100 patients with elevated pretreatment serum PSA levels. The actuarial 2-year rate of PSA normalization was 96%, 97%, and 63% for pretreatment PSAs of > 4-10, > 10-20, and > 20, respectively. The 13 patients with rising PSA demonstrated local recurrence (3 patients), distant metastasis (8 patients), or no evidence of disease except increasing PSA (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of side effects, despite the tumor dose of 75 CGE, demonstrates that conformal protons can deliver higher doses of radiation to target tissues without increasing complications to surrounding normal tissues. The initial tumor response, as assessed by the high actuarial rate of normalization with pretreatment PSA < or = 20, and the low rate of recurrences within the treatment field (2.8%), are encouraging

This instrument has several distinct advantages over frame-based systems, including improved patient comfort, increased treatment degrees of freedom, and the potential to target extracranial lesions. Clinical results thus far with respect to the treatment of malignant intracranial tumors has been promising. Additionally, the Cyberknife will likely revolutionize the application of radiosurgery to extracranial sites. A description of the components, treatment planning, and clinical results of the Cyberknife will be reviewed

Between December 1993 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years [8 - 85], M/F sex ratio: 3/2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) by a 201 MeV beam. The median total dose delivered to the tumor volume was 67 GyECo. With a median follow-up of 31 months [range: 0 - 87], 25 tumours relapsed locally. The 2- and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, at least 95% of the tumor volume encompassed by the 95% isodose (p = 0.048; RR: 3.4 95%CI [1.01 - 11.8]) and a minimal dose delivered into the tumor volume <56 GyECo (p = 0.042; RR: 2.3 95%CI [1.03 - 5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, local tumor control (p = 0.005; RR: 21 95%CI [2.2 - 200]) was a prognostic factor of overall survival. For chordomas of the base of the skull and upper cervical spine treated by surgery and irradiation combining photons and protons, the quality of irradiation, reflected by homogeneity of the dose into the tumor volume, is a major factor of local control. Close attention must be paid to minimize the underdosed areas close to critical organs. The role of surgical resection remains paramount, and a trial of dose escalation would have to consider an increase in the dose to critical organs, especially as current results indicate the low toxicity of this treatment

A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a "classical" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique.

It identifies the risk factors for local tumor-control failure and for ocular tumor-related death. It presents the improvements implemented to increase the rate of local tumor control, and compares the survival rate of patients with locally controlled tumors to those of patients who had to receive a second treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated 2,435 uveal melanomas with PBRT between March 1984 and December 1998. Data were analyzed as of September 1999. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 89 years; there were 1,188 men and 1,247 women. The largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 26 mm, and tumor thickness from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 40 months. RESULTS: Local tumor control probability at 5 years was improved from 90.6 +/- 1.7% for patients treated before 1988, to 96.3 +/- 0.6% for patients treated between 1989 and 1993, and became 98.9 +/- 0.6% for patients treated after 1993. Among 2,435 treated patients, 73 (3%) had to receive a second treatment because of tumor regrowth. Cause-specific survival at 10 years was calculated to 72.6 +/- 1.9% for patients with controlled tumors compared to 47.5 +/- 6.5% for those with recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: Reduced safety margins, large ciliary body tumors, eyelids within the treatment field, inadequate positioning of tantalum clips, and male gender were identified to be the main factors impairing local tumor control. The improvement of local tumor control rate after 1993 is attributed to changes implemented in the treatment procedure. Our data strongly support that the rate of death by metastases is influenced by local tumor control failure: improvement of the local tumor control rate results in a better survival rate

It identifies the risk factors for local tumor-control failure and for ocular tumor-related death. It presents the improvements implemented to increase the rate of local tumor control, and compares the survival rate of patients with locally controlled tumors to those of patients who had to receive a second treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated 2,435 uveal melanomas with PBRT between March 1984 and December 1998. Data were analyzed as of September 1999. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 89 years; there were 1,188 men and 1,247 women. The largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 26 mm, and tumor thickness from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 40 months. RESULTS: Local tumor control probability at 5 years was improved from 90.6 +/- 1.7% for patients treated before 1988, to 96.3 +/- 0.6% for patients treated between 1989 and 1993, and became 98.9 +/- 0.6% for patients treated after 1993.

Forty of these 45 patients received at least 6000 cGy. The 5 and 10 year actuarial survival rates were 31 and 20%. Four patients are currently alive without evidence of disease at least 10 years after treatment. Local persistence or recurrence of tumor in the nasopharynx was the primary cause of failure and occurred in 42% of our patients. The likelihood of this type of treatment failure correlated with the initial "T stage" of disease. Inability to control nodal disease was less common, occurring in 23% of evaluable patients and was proportional to the "N stage." Distant metastases became apparent in 13% of our patients and correlated with the "N stage." More than 90% of recurrences were evident within two and all occurred within three years of treatment

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

0	3780	The 200-MeV proton therapy project at the Paul Scherrer Institute: conceptual design and practical realization	Cyclotrons, Head, Humans, Optics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiography, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Rotation, Switzerland, X-Rays	The new proton therapy facility is being assembled at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The beam delivered by the PSI sector cyclotron can be split and brought into a new hall where it is degraded from 590 MeV down to an energy in the range of 85-270 MeV. A new beam line following the degrader is used to clean the low-energetic beam in phase space and momentum band. The analyzed beam is then injected into a compact isocentric gantry, where it is applied to the patient using a new dynamic treatment modality, the so-called spot-scanning technique. This technique will permit full three-dimensional conformation of the dose to the target volume to be realized in a routine way without the need for individualized patient hardware like collimators and compensators. By combining the scanning of the focused pencil beam within the beam optics of the gantry and by mounting the patient table eccentrically on the gantry, the diameter of the rotating structure has been reduced to only 4 m. In the article the degrees of freedom available on the gantry to apply the beam to the patient (with two rotations for head treatments) are also discussed. The devices for the positioning of the patient on the gantry (x rays and proton radiography) and outside the treatment room (the patient transporter system and the modified mechanics of the computer tomograph unit) are briefly presented. The status of the facility and first experimental results are introduced for later reference

Because lupus erythematosus tumidus (LET) has rarely been documented in the literature and is often difficult to differentiate from other photodermatoses such as polymorphous light eruption, we performed photoprovocation tests in 60 patients with LET according to a standardized protocol. Areas of uninvolved skin on the upper back were irradiated with single doses of UV-A (100 J/cm2) and/or UV-B (1.5 minimal erythema dose) daily for three consecutive days. Interestingly, patients with LET are more photosensitive than those with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and in our study experimental phototesting revealed characteristic skin lesions in 43 patients (72%). Because of the latency period in developing positive phototest reactions, it might be difficult for these patients to link sun exposure with their skin lesions. Furthermore, our data revealed a positive correlation of antinuclear antibodies and positive provocative phototest reactions in these patients as seen for other forms of LE. In conclusion, the high incidence of positive phototest reactions in correlation with the clinical findings, history of photosensitivity and antinuclear antibodies enable the classification of LET as the most photosensitive type of LE

We have made it a rule to do field localization by X-ray pictures before each treatment. For this purpose we have developed a localize-verify system consisting of a fluoroscopic unit and a real time digital image processing device. By using this system as well as X-ray films, field placement errors or corrected distance at field localization were measured in 11 patients with esophageal cancers. Measurements of corrected distances on a total of 177 localization attempts disclosed that correction by > 5 mm was necessary in 30.6% and by > 10 mm in 10.2% of all localization attempts. Corrected distances appeared to increase with age, possibly because the skin becomes looser and ambulatory status tends to be more limited in older patients. Field placement corrections of more than 5 mm were required in 66.7% of 60 localizations in patients > 80 years old. Two patients in whom the anatomical positions of the esophagus were easily movable are presented. The following common characteristics of these patients were considered high risk factors: they were more than 80 years old; lesions were located in the lower esophagus; and they had T1 tumors. These findings suggested that frequent positioning and verification of treatment fields are necessary in the accurate treatment of esophageal cancers, especially those in high-risk patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, a Phase II clinical trial of C-ion RT with a total dose of 66 GyE in 20 fractions was performed on 175 patients with prostate cancer, and the correlations of clinical and dosimetric parameters with the incidence of late GI toxicity in 172 patients who survived for more than 18 months were investigated. RESULTS: Although no Grade 3-4 late morbidities of the rectum were observed, Grade 1 and 2 morbidities developed in 23 (13%) and 4 (2%) patients, respectively. Dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the percentage of rectal volume receiving 50% of the prescribed dose (V50) was significantly higher in patients with rectal toxicity than without toxicity (13.2 +/- 5.6% with toxicity; 11.4 +/- 4.0% without toxicity, p = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.010) and rectal V50 (p = 0.012) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of Grade 1-2 late GI toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although C-ion RT with hypofractionation yielded favorable results regarding late GI complication, dosimetric parameter was a very important factor in the occurrence of rectal bleeding after C-ion RT as well as photon beam RT. Our results provide useful information for physicians applying charged particle RT in the treatment of prostate cancer

Dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the percentage of rectal volume receiving 50% of the prescribed dose (V50) was significantly higher in patients with rectal toxicity than without toxicity (13.2 +/- 5.6% with toxicity; 11.4 +/- 4.0% without toxicity, p = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.010) and rectal V50 (p = 0.012) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of Grade 1-2 late GI toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although C-ion RT with hypofractionation yielded favorable results regarding late GI complication, dosimetric parameter was a very important factor in the occurrence of rectal bleeding after C-ion RT as well as photon beam RT. Our results provide useful information for physicians applying charged particle RT in the treatment of prostate cancer

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

Dose calculations in the body for treatment planning are converted to dose distributions in water, and the converted calculations are then generally evaluated by the dose measurements in water. In this paper, proton dose calculations were realized for a phantom simulating a clinical heterogeneity. Both dose calculations in the phantom calculated by two dose calculation methods, the range-modulated pencil beam algorithm (RMPBA) and the simplified Monte Carlo (SMC) method, and dose calculations converted to dose distributions in water by the same two methods were verified experimentally through comparison with measured distributions, respectively. For the RMPBA, though the converted calculations in water agreed moderately well with the measured ones, the calculated results in the actual phantom produced large errors. This meant that dose calculations in treatment planning should be evaluated by the dose measurements not in water but in the body with heterogeneity. On the other hand, the results calculated in the phantom, even by the less rigorous SMC method, reproduced the experimental ones well. This finding showed that actual dose distributions in the body should be predicted by the SMC method

In this paper, the present status of BNCT for malignant melanoma was introduced. As a melanoma-targetting 10B-compound, 10B-paraboronophylalanine (BPA) was used. It was administered by multiple subcutaneous injection or intravenous drip infusion. We adopted the maximum tolerance dose to the skin as a therapeutic dose regardless of the tumor 10B concentration, because we cannot directly measure it. For this purpose, an approximation of skin concentration was made using blood data just after the administration. We treated 14 melanoma patients in this way and obtained good local control of the tumor with tolerable skin reaction. More experience with logical analysis and basic research is necessary for further development of this therapy

The tumor mass usually surrounds the spinal cord and infiltrates vertebral bone. A combined technique using protons or electrons to boost the initial photon fields is generally applied. We evaluated the use of dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy as an alternative technique for treating advanced cervical chordoma. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A female patient with incomplete resection of a vertebral chordoma surrounding C2-C3 was irradiated with a total dose of 58 Gy (ICRU point) in 2 Gy daily fractions for 29 days between December 2001 and January 2002. Beam arrangement consisted of seven 6 MV non-opposed coplanar fields. Pretreatment quality assurance included checking of the absolute dose at reference points and 2D dose map analysis. Treatment was delivered with a 120-leaf collimator in sliding window mode. To verify the daily setup, portal images at 0 degrees and 90 degrees were compared with the simulation images before treatment delivery (manual matching) and after treatment delivery (automatic anatomy matching). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The mean dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 57.6 +/- 2.1 Gy covering 95% of the PTV per 95% isodose. The minimum dose to the PTV (D99) was 53.6 Gy in the overlapping area between the PTV and the spinal cord planning organ at risk volume (PRV). The maximum dose to the spinal cord was 42.2 Gy and to the spinal cord PRV (8 mm margin) 53.7 Gy. The mean dose to the parotid glands was 37.4 Gy (homolateral gland) and 19.5 Gy (contralateral gland). Average deviation in setup was -1.1 +/- 2.5 mm (anterior-posterior), 2.4 +/- 1.3 mm (latero-lateral), 0.7 +/- 0.9 mm (craniocaudal) and -0.43 +/- 1 degree (rotation). CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of chordomas surrounding the spinal cord, intensity-modulated radiotherapy can provide high dose homogeneity and PTV coverage. Frequent digital portal image-based setup control is able to reduce random positioning errors for head and neck cancer patients immobilized with conventional thermoplastic masks

We have treated 54 patients with ciliary body melanoma using helium ions from 1978 to 1985. Because of the high rate of metastatic disease, the 5-year disease specific survival rate is only 59% despite a 5-year local control rate of 98%. The greatest diameter of the tumor was predictive of loss of vision and enucleation (p = .05, p = .04, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the greatest diameter of the tumor was the most important predictor of death from metastases. The incidence of neovascular glaucoma at 5 years is 43%. The 5-year actuarial rate of enucleation is 26%. Enucleation was done for pain and/or neovascular glaucoma. Univariate analysis showed treatment volume to be a statistically significant predictor for the development of neovascular glaucoma (p = .0017) and enucleation (p = .0078). Seventy percent of neovascular glaucoma occurred in patients with treatment volume greater than 5.5 cc. Seventy-four percent occurred in patients with an initial ultrasound height greater than 9.2 mm. Using this information, patients at high risk for neovascular glaucoma could be considered for prophylactic treatment with panretinal photocoagulation

Seventy percent of neovascular glaucoma occurred in patients with treatment volume greater than 5.5 cc. Seventy-four percent occurred in patients with an initial ultrasound height greater than 9.2 mm. Using this information, patients at high risk for neovascular glaucoma could be considered for prophylactic treatment with panretinal photocoagulation

[German]	Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radium, Risk, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Since April 1983 patients with gynecologic tumors have been irradiated with the HDR afterloading method at the University Hospital of Cologne. The therapy scheme for the carcinoma of the cervix consists of a combination of intracavitary contact irradiation and external radiotherapy. Brachytherapy is preponderant in an early stage of tumor extension, whereas teletherapy contributes more to the total dose in advanced stages. At first, the pelvis is totally exposed to a homogenous irradiation, so the shrunken tumor can more easily be arrived by curietherapy. The therapy scheme is described for the different tumor stages with its dosages, fractionations, and treatment pauses. Besides the use of special multiple-way applicators, the risk organs are protected by collimating with a block the middle part of the external irradiation field as soon as the maximum permissible dose is reached. A special block shape minimizes the dose irregularities at the field borders. The total physical dose at point A is about 60 Gy. The high dose rate of HDR afterloading has to be considered when calculating the biologic efficient dose. Here the dose rate factor furnishes a rough relation to the established radium dosage

Thirty-four tumors were included in the experimental groups, of which twenty-three were irradiated and eleven served as controls. Tumors were irradiated with protons produced at the 160 megavolts Harvard cyclotron. The dose delivered to the tumor ranged from 7.5 to 27.5 proton gray in a single treatment, and 25.0 proton gray delivered in two fractions separated by 24 hours. Reduction of tumor growth was significantly greater than controls (p less than 0.001) with treatment doses greater than or equal to 17.5 proton gray. Histologic examination revealed a marked decrease of mitotic activity in all specimens examined 48 hours after treatment at these higher doses. Total regression without evidence of remaining malignant cells was noted in three tumors treated at 17.5 proton gray or above. Our results indicate that human retinoblastoma in a murine host, with a tumor mass similar to that seen in a clinical setting, is sensitive to radiation by high energy protons

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

The rate of recurrence is particularly high in cases of large size tumor, of widespread tumors and with PAM associated lesions. Tumor recurrences have a bad long-term prognostic significance and often necessitate exenteration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A method of therapy combining total surgical excision with proton-beam irradiation, cobalt plaque irradiation and cryotherapy is described. This technique is used in particular unfavorable cases with the aim of lowering the rate of recurrences. It was practiced in 19 cases in Lausanne, 10 of which were recurrent tumors. The melanoma invaded 3 quadrants of the bulbar conjunctiva in 8 cases and 4 quadrants in 11 cases. At least one neighbouring tarsal conjunctiva was invaded in 11 cases and both in 7 cases. The skin of the eyelid was infiltrated in 6 cases and the caruncle in 9 cases. Tumor thickness was 1 to 2 mm in 8 cases, 3 to 4 mm in 4 cases and 5 to 10 mm in 7 cases. RESULTS: PAM was present in 16 cases. Follow-up period was less than 1 year in 2 cases, between 1 to 2 years in 5 cases, between 2 to 3 years in 5 cases and more than 3 years in 7 cases. 5 patients had lymph node metastases, 3 died of metastatic disease and 2 had a local recurrence. One of these recurrences was small-sized and was excised, the other was widespread and the patient died soon with metastatic disease. No exenteration was performed.

This synthesis of the literature is based on data from one meta-analysis, 30 randomized trials, many dealing with hormonal therapy, 55 prospective trials, and 210 retrospective studies. Totally the studies included 152,614 patients. There is a lack of properly controlled clinical trials in most important aspects of radiation therapy in prostate cancer. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: * There are no randomized studies that compare the outcome of surgery (radical prostatectomy) with either external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized low-risk prostate cancer. However, with the advent of widely accepted prognostic markers for prostate cancer (pre-treatment PSA, Gleason score, and T-stage), such comparisons have been made possible. There is substantial documentation from large single-institutional and multi-institutional series on patients with this disease category (PSA < 10, GS < or = 6, < or = T2b) showing that the outcome of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy is similar to those of surgery. * There is fairly strong evidence that patients with localized, intermediate risk, and high risk (pre-treatment PSA > or = 10 and/or GS > or = 7 and/or > T2) disease, i.e. patients normally not suited for surgery, benefit from higher than conventional total dose. No overall survival benefit has yet been shown. * Dose escalation to patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease can be performed with 3D conformal radiotherapy (photon or proton) boost, with Ir-192 high dose rate brachytherapy boost, or brachytherapy boost with permanent seed implantation. Despite an increased risk of urinary tract and/or rectal side effects, dose-escalated therapy can generally be safely delivered with all three techniques. * There is some evidence that 3D conformal radiotherapy results in reduced late rectal toxicity and acute anal toxicity compared with radiotherapy administered with non-conformal treatment volumes. * There is some evidence that postoperative external beam radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy in patients with pT3 disease prolongs biochemical disease-free survival and that the likelihood of achieving long-term DFS is higher when treatment is given in an adjuvant rather than a salvage setting. A breakpoint seems to exist around a PSA level of 1.0 ng/mL, above which the likelihood for eradication of the recurrence of cancer diminishes. * After prostatectomy, endocrine therapy prior to and during adjuvant radiotherapy may result in longer biochemical disease-free survival than if only adjuvant radiotherapy is given. No impact on overall survival has been shown. * There is fairly strong evidence that short-term endocrine therapy prior to and during radiotherapy results in increased disease-free survival, increased local control, reduced incidence of distant metastases, and reduced cause-specific mortality in patients with locally advanced disease. * There is some evidence that short-term endocrine therapy prior to and during radiotherapy results in increased overall survival in a subset (GS 2-6) of patients with locally advanced disease. * There is strong evidence that adjuvant endocrine treatment after curative radiotherapy results in improved local control, increased freedom from distant metastases, and increased disease-free survival in patients with loco-regionally advanced and/or high-risk disease. * There is moderately strong evidence that adjuvant endocrine treatment after radiotherapy results in longer overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a radiotherapy technique that uses linear accelerators with multileaf collimators to treat the pelvis and sequentially boost the inguinal regions, while minimizing "hot spots" across the match-line. This was achieved by angling the gantry for the inguinal fields so that their medial borders aligned with the divergence of the posterior pelvic field. Film dosimetry was performed to compare the MSBT with the traditional segmental boost technique, partial transmission block, and photon/electron combination techniques. These treatment techniques were scored on the basis of the dose homogeneity index, defined as the ratio of match-line maximum dose to the average dose at a given depth in the groin treatment area. RESULTS: The values of the dose homogeneity index were the same (1.04) for MSBT and partial transmission block, and 1.21, 1.39, and 1.18 for the segmental boost technique, photon pelvis with electron tags, and photon pelvis with electron boost, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MSBT proved to be technically simple while optimizing dose homogeneity compared with the other techniques and allows for maximum use of the features of modern linear accelerators

The ability to achieve high degrees of radiation dose conformity by using protons has resulted in higher radiation doses than can be delivered with conventional radiotherapy in the base of skull. High target volume doses have led to improved tumor control and patient survival. Side effects such as severe toxicity are acceptable considering the alternatives of uncontrolled tumor growth. The authors of various analyses have identified prognostic factors that can be used to predict a patient's chance of treatment success. On the horizon are important technical developments that will further increase dose conformity and increase target doses.

[Review] [20 refs]	Age Factors, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Neoplasm,Residual, Prognosis, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Sex Factors, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Analysis, United States	Fractionated proton beam radiotherapy has been used for skull base tumors in the United States since the mid-70s, and more than 300 patients in whom diagnosis of chordoma of the skull base has been made have been treated. The ability to achieve high degrees of radiation dose conformity by using protons has resulted in higher radiation doses than can be delivered with conventional radiotherapy in the base of skull. High target volume doses have led to improved tumor control and patient survival. Side effects such as severe toxicity are acceptable considering the alternatives of uncontrolled tumor growth. The authors of various analyses have identified prognostic factors that can be used to predict a patient's chance of treatment success. On the horizon are important technical developments that will further increase dose conformity and increase target doses. In this paper the author reviews long-term outcome data and prognostic predictors for survival of patients with skull base chordomas based on the largest worldwide patient series. [References: 20]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At HIMAC, relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) values of therapeutic carbon beams were determined based on experimental results of cell responses, on values expected with the linear-quadratic model, and based on experiences with neutron therapy. We use fixed RBE values independent of dose levels, although this apparently contradicts radiobiologic observations. Our RBE system depends only on LET of the heavy-ion radiation fields. With this RBE system, over 2,000 patients have been treated by carbon beams. With data from these patients, the local control rate of non-small-cell lung cancer was analyzed to verify the clinical RBE of the carbon beam. The local control rate was compared with rates published by groups from Gunma University and Massachusetts General Hospital. Using a simplified tumor control probability (TCP) model, clinical RBE values were obtained for different levels of TCP. RESULTS: For the 50% level of the clinical TCP, the RBE values nearly coincide with those for in vitro human salivary gland cell survival at 10%. For the higher levels of clinical TCP, the RBE values approach closer to those adapted in clinical trials at HIMAC

1	2685	Fractionated radiotherapy of small inoperable lesions of the brain using a non-invasive stereotactic frame	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, France, Head, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Stereotaxic Techniques, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry	Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and benign or low grade, small malignant tumors can be treated by stereotactic radiotherapy in a single fraction. This report describes a technique for stereotactic treatment of small lesions using conventional, fractionated, photon beam irradiation. The Laitinen's stereoadapter, non-invasive head frame was used. This device was tested for accuracy by serial mountings and found to be accurate within 1 mm. The accuracy of the dose delivered was within 2%. Adaptation of this device to the linear accelerator required the design of secondary circular collimators which decreased the penumbra from 3-4 mm to 2-3 mm. The dose fall off outside the target volume is steep enough when using two non-coplanar arcs (90 to 10% within 1 cm). Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) in a humanoid phantom showed good correlation with the calculated dose. This system permits delivery of fractionated radiation therapy to small volumes, easily and accurately, under stereotactic conditions	
1	3007	The assessment of doses and effects from intakes of radioactive particles. [Review] [23 refs]	Absorption, Administration,Oral, Adult, Alpha Particles, Dose-Response Relationship,Drug, Fibrosis, Half-Life, Humans, Infant, Intestinal Absorption/ph [Physiology], Lead, Liver, Lung, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Radioisotopes/pk [Pharmacokinetics], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Skin, Tissue Distribution	The behaviour of radionuclides after entry into the body and the radiation doses received by individual tissues depend on the chemical nature of the element, the physicochemical form of the intake, the radioactive half-life of the isotope and the type and energy of the emissions. Ingestion of radionuclides in insoluble particles will result in radiation doses being delivered to tissues of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; other tissues will also be irradiated by nuclides with penetrating photons emissions (gamma) but doses may be largely confined to the GI tract for charged particle emissions (alpha, beta). Ingestion of more soluble forms will lead to greater absorption to blood and deposition in other tissues and therefore may result in greater doses to other tissues. Similar considerations apply to inhaled material and to the entry of radionuclides through cuts or wounds. For ingested materials, including particles, more information is needed on uptake and retention in intestinal tissues and consequent doses to sensitive cells, particularly for alpha emitters. There has been concern that the pattern of distribution of activity throughout irradiated tissues may influence the extent of damage, particularly for alpha emitters because of the localised deposition of energy and their greater relative biological effectiveness compared with beta/gamma emitters. Aggregation of activity has the potential to result in greater acute tissue damage and has been shown, for example, to result in focalised pneumonitis and fibrosis in the lung and ulceration of the skin. The main long-term effect of irradiation of tissues is the induction of malignant change, although hereditary disease may also be of concern following irradiation of the gonads. There are only limited data available to compare the effect on cancer induction of heterogeneous and homogeneous irradiation of tissues. However, the available information, for irradiation of the lung, skin or liver, indicates that in general nonuniform alpha irradiation from radioactive particles is no more hazardous, and may be less hazardous, than if the same activity is uniformly distributed.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

We report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery in nine patients with ten glomus tumors. All patients were treated either with frame based LINAC or Cyberknife with doses ranging from 1600 cGy to 2500 cGy. Three patients received no previous therapy and one patient received additional external beam radiation for concomitant treatment of carotid body tumors. Patients were then followed for post treatment side effects in addition to change in tumor size by MRI evaluation. The median clinical follow-up time was 26 months (mean 54 months), median radiographic follow-up was 21.5 months (mean 46 months), with a range from 3 to 126 months. The results from our center demonstrated nine of ten tumors to be stable in size by MRI exam, and one tumor which regressed in size. Nine patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one patient experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. Our results continue to support radiosurgery as a suitable form of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors as evidenced by results from this four and a half year follow-up

Thirty-three patients developed metastasis (6.5%) from 3 to 51 months following treatment. The primary site of metastasis was the liver in 28 cases (85%). Both demographic and clinical factors were considered. The three leading predictors of survival without metastasis after proton beam irradiation in order of importance were: (1) largest diameter of the tumor; (2) location of the anterior margin of the tumor; and (3) age at treatment. Worse prognosis was associated with largest tumor diameter greater than 15.0 mm, tumor involvement of the ciliary body and age at treatment older than 59 years

1	1584	Surgical approaches and strategies for skull base chordomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Chordoma/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Quality of Life, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: The management of chordomas involving the skull base continues to present a number of treatment-related problems. Recently, both radical resection and charged-particle irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery have reportedly been found effective for tumor control and for promoting a better quality of life in patients. In this article the authors analyzed the outcomes in 17 patients with skull base chordomas who were surgically treated at Kobe University Hospital between 1972 and 2000. METHODS: Preoperative radiological examinations included magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, angiography, and balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery. Among the various surgical approaches used to remove the tumor were the frontoorbitozygomatic, transmaxillary, transcondylar, transsphenoidal, and the transbasal. Total removal was achieved in two (12%), near-total removal in three (18%), subtotal removal in nine (52%), and partial removal in three patients (18%). Since 1990, chordomas have been radically resected via various skull base approaches; the combined total or near-total removal rate has been 80% in this period. Radical removal of the tumors has not led to an increased risk. At the final follow-up review (mean 59.5 month), 75% of the patients were still alive, and 25% had died of chordoma recurrence. The overall recurrence-free survival rate was 82% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate in the five patients who underwent the operation during the past decade was 77% (mean follow up of 5.2 years). In two patients with recurrent tumors who underwent radiosurgery, no evidence of tumor regrowth was demonstrated at 3 years posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that for the treatment of skull base chordomas radical resection is a key factor for longer survival and improved quality of life. Patients with sufficiently small tumors, which show a favorable configuration and location, can be suitable candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 188 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas (<15 mm in diameter and <5 mm in height) near the optic disc or macula (within 4 disc diameters of either structure). METHODS: Patients were treated with proton beam therapy at doses of either 50 CGE or 70 CGE between October 1989 and July 1994, and followed up biannually through April 1998. Outcomes included visual acuity, radiation complications, melanoma recurrence, and metastasis. RESULTS: Proportions of patients retaining visual acuity of at least 20/200 were similar in the 2 dose groups at 5 years after radiation (approximately 55%). Similar numbers of patients in each group experienced tumor regrowth (2 patients at 50 CGE vs 3 patients at 70 CGE; P>.99) and metastasis (7 patients at 50 CGE vs 8 patients at 70 CGE;P=.79). Five-year rates of radiation maculopathy also were similar (for both groups, approximately 75% for tumors within 1 disc diameter and 40% for tumors >1 disc diameter from the macula). Rates of radiation papillopathy were nonsignificantly decreased in the 50-CGE treatment group when tumors were located 1 disc diameter or less from the optic disc (P=.20). Patients treated with the lower dose also experienced significantly less visual field loss. CONCLUSIONS: This level of dose reduction did not result in a lesser degree of visual acuity loss. The lower-dose group did experience significantly less visual field loss. Local tumor recurrence and metastatic death rates were similar in both dose groups. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:773-778

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 3,561 patients who underwent conformal radiation for prostate cancer. Therapy consisted of proton irradiation of the prostate and seminal vesicles and X-ray treatment of the pelvis when warranted. The number of treatments in which the balloon was tolerated was recorded. Results were stratified according to method of irradiation (protons alone vs. combined proton/X-ray) and method of planning (2D vs. 3D planning of X-ray fields in patients undergoing combination treatment). RESULTS: Of all the patients evaluated, 3,474 (97.6%) tolerated the balloon throughout treatment; 87 (2.4%) declined the balloon for 1 or more treatments and tolerated the balloon for 85.5% of their treatments. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant tolerance advantage in those who received protons alone compared with combination treatment (99.5% vs. 95.7%; p < 0.001). In patients undergoing combination treatment, chi-square analysis did not reveal significant tolerance differences in patients undergoing 3D vs. 2D planning for pelvic X-ray fields (95.74% vs. 95.72%; p = 0.990). CONCLUSIONS: Intrarectal balloons are well tolerated over a course of conformal prostate irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

Analysis of combined data from the 13 patients revealed statistically significant improvement in 5 clinical indicators of disease activity at the end of TLI and 6 and 12 months later, accompanied by T4-specific immunosuppression. Management considerations resulted in the introduction of prednisone therapy in 5 patients, methotrexate in 4, and azathioprine in 1 during the interval of 8-12 months post-TLI. Herpes zoster occurred in 5 patients prior to the initiation of this additional therapy. These data indicate that, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a TLI dose of 2,000 cGy is sufficient to produce measurable benefit that lasts for 6 months, and that the improvement can be maintained at 12 months by the use of prednisone and methotrexate

Eighty-two percent of the patients had widespread metastatic disease, and the mean tumor burden was 2,900 cc. Seventy-nine percent of the patients received concurrent radiotherapy. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain within the AA aperture (43%), systemic stress (43%), and nausea or vomiting (29%). Systemic stress was the most frequent power-limiting factor (46%). There were two treatment-related complications: sciatic neuritis from intramuscular injection (one) and pleural effusion from thermometry probe placement (one). Detailed thermal mapping and thermal dosimetry were performed on 26 patients. The mean thermal dosimetry parameters were quite low. Concurrent radiation doses were also quite low (mean, 1,500 rad) to avoid toxicity of sensitive organ systems within the abdomen. The objective response rate was only 18%, all partial, but 43% of the patients achieved effective symptomatic palliation. The five objective responders did survive significantly (P = .02) longer than the 23 nonresponders

With its energy (62 MeV proton beam), it is ideal for the treatment of shallow tumors like those of the ocular region: uveal melanoma, first of all (the most common primary intraocular malignancy of adults) and other less frequent lesions like choroidal hemangioma, conjunctiva melanoma, and eyelid tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The first patient was enrolled in February 2002, and to date 30 patients have been treated. All patients had a localized uveal melanoma, with no systemic metastases, and had specific indications for proton beam radiation therapy: lesions between 5-25 mm basal diameter, not exceeding 15 mm thickness, absence of total retinal detachment or glaucoma. According to the tumor dimensions, 2 patients had a small lesion or T1 (6%), 3 had a medium-sized lesion or T2 (10%), 14 had a large lesion or T3 (47%), and 11 had an extra-large lesion or T3 (37%); no patient had extrascleral invasion or T4 of the TNM-AJCC Staging System. In most cases, the tumor infiltrated only the choroid (14 patients, 47%) or the choroid plus the ciliary body (14 patients, 47%). We also treated a primitive iris melanoma, without diffusion to the ciliary body. The target volume was defined as the tumor plus a safety margin of 2.5 mm, laterally and antero-posteriorly; this margin was increased to 3 mm if ciliary body involvement was present. The treatment was carried out in 4 fractions on 4 consecutive days to a total dose of 54.5 Gy (single fraction 13.6 Gy), which corresponds to 60 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent; single fraction 15 CGE), because the relative biological effectiveness is 1.1. RESULTS: The first follow-up is planned at 6-8 months after the end of the treatment, and our clinical end points are local control (defined as cessation of growth or tumor shrinkage), eye retention, and maintenance of a good visual function. At the time of this writing, we had preliminary results from 13 patients. Nine patients showed tumor shrinkage (69%), 3 a substantially stable dimension (23%), but almost all patients presented an increased ultrasound reflectivity (a surrogate for tumor control). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature data show that charged particle therapy has allowed an optimal local control in the treatment of uveal melanomas (about 96% in the different series, superior to that obtained with plaquetherapy [between 83% and 92%]), a metastatic rate slightly better than enucleation reports, and a survival rate of almost 90% at 5 years. Our preliminary results show a tumor response in almost all cases, with no major acute or subacute side effects. We thus plan to continue with our treatment procedures and our dose prescription

This inhomogeneous spatial distribution of lesions can be visualized indirectly and rapidly in the form of radiation-induced foci using immunocytochemical detection or GFP-tagged DNA repair proteins. To analyze faster protein translocations and a possible contribution of radiation-induced chromatin movement in DNA damage recognition in live cells, we developed a remote-controlled system to obtain high-resolution fluorescence images of living cells during ion irradiation with a frame rate of the order of seconds. Using scratch replication labeling, only minor chromatin movement at sites of ion traversal was observed within the first few minutes of impact. Furthermore, time-lapse images of the GFP-coupled DNA repair protein aprataxin revealed accumulations within seconds at sites of ion hits, indicating a very fast recruitment to damaged sites. Repositioning of the irradiated cells after fixation allowed the comparison of live cell observation with immunocytochemical staining and retrospective etching of ion tracks. These results demonstrate that heavy-ion radiation-induced changes in subnuclear structures can be used to determine the kinetics of early protein recruitment in living cells and that the changes are not dependent on large-scale chromatin movement at short times postirradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1974 and 1995, 367 patients with chordomas (n = 195) and chondrosarcomas (n = 172) of the base of skull have been treated with combined megavoltage photon and 160 MeV proton radiotherapy. Following 3D treatment planning with delineation of target volumes and critical nontarget structures dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were calculated. Radiotherapy was given an 1.8 Gy or CGE (=Cobalt Gray Equivalent) dose per fraction, with prescribed target doses ranging from 63 CGE to 79.2 CGE (mean = 67.8 CGE). Doses to the brainstem surface were limited to < or = 64 CGE and to the brainstem center to < or = 53 CGE. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 6 months to 21.4 years (mean = 42.5 months). Brainstem toxicity was observed in 17 of 367 patients attributable to treatment, resulting in death of three patients. Actuarial rates of 5 and 10-year high-grade toxicity-free survival were 94 and 88%, respectively. Increased risk of brainstem toxicity was significantly associated with maximum dose to brainstem, volume of brainstem receiving > or = 50 CGE, > or = 55 CGE, and > or = 60 CGE, number of surgical procedures, and prevalence of diabetes or high blood pressure. Multivariate analysis identified three independent factors as important prognosticators: number of surgical procedures (p < 0.001), volume of the brainstem receiving 60 CGE (p < 0.001), and prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tolerance of brainstem to fractionated radiotherapy appears to be a steep function of tissue volume included in high dose regions rather than the maximum dose of brainstem alone. In addition, presence of predisposing factors as well as extent of surgical manipulation can significantly lower brainstem tolerance in the individual patient

The results of clinical trials with fast neutrons have shown that carcinoma of the salivary gland and the prostate and Pancoast tumor of the lung were indications for fast neutron therapy, and that the patients suffering from osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma had indications for fast neutrons when fast neutrons were combined with surgery. Neither carcinoma of the pancreas nor glioblastoma multiforme had indications because of complications of normal tissues. High LET radiation therapy will be evaluated by using heavy ions characterized by Bragg peak combined with biological effects

Thirty-two patients who received proton radiotherapy with doses of 50-87 Gy underwent MR imaging 1-75 months (mean 22 months) after the start of irradiation. Axial T(2), T(1)-weighted imaging, and a dynamic study after a gadolinium injection were performed. The irradiated areas showed hypointense in T(1)-weighted images, hyperintense in T(2)-weighted images, and intense and prolonged enhancement on the dynamic study (maximum relative enhancement 441.8%+/-263.3 vs. surrounding liver 145.6%+/-67.7, p<0.0001). T(2) values of the irradiated areas were 50.6 to 65.8 msec greater than in the surrounding liver (p<0.005). The values increased with time, being significantly greater 13 months or longer after the beginning of the therapy than after a period of less than 3 months (p<0.05). Pathologic examinations (n = 3) indicated that the irradiated areas were composed of collapsed lobules with hepatic small vein occlusions, and rich extracellular matrices which retained extracellular fluid. MR imaging can demonstrate hepatic parenchymal changes after proton beam radiotherapy, and show the changes are irreversible

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

The pelvic lymph nodes received a total dose of 2 Gy X 25 by means of an anterior and posterior radiation field. The prostatic gland was irradiated by an additional booster dose of 2 Gy X 10 given to a perineal field. Twenty-four patients have relapsed after their prostatic radiotherapy, only three of them within the irradiated area. For the patients with T0-T2 tumors, the 5-year crude survival was 69%, whereas it was only 37% for patients with T3 tumors. Thirty-five patients developed intestinal (26 patients) and/or urogenital (23 patients) radiation side effects. In three patients a colostomy had to be performed owing to rectal stricture or fistula. The poor survival after radiotherapy in the present series is probably due to a high incidence of unrecognized pelvic lymph node metastases. In the future only prostatic cancer patients without pelvic lymph node spread will be considered candidates for definitive radiotherapy. An optimal radiation technique is mandatory in order to avoid major radiotherapy-induced toxicity

We applied this technique to stereotactic three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluated the primary therapeutic outcomes. A total of 35 patients with stage I (15 IA, 20 IB) primary NSCLC (20 adeno, 13 squamous cell, and 2 others) were treated with this technique. Patients ranged from 65 to 92 years old (median, 78 years). Twenty-three (66%) patients were medically inoperable due to mainly chronic pulmonary disease or high age. Three-dimensional treatment plans were made using 10 different non-coplanar dynamic arcs. The total dose of 60 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions (over 5-8 days) at the minimum dose point in the planning target volume (PTV) using a 6 MV X-ray. After adjusting the isocenter of the PTV to the planned position by a unit comprising CT and linear accelerator, irradiation was performed under patient-controlled breath-hold and radiation beam switching. All patients completed the treatment course without complaint. Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 8/35 (23%) and 25/35 (71%), respectively. Pulmonary complications of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria grade >2 were noted in three (9%) patients. During follow-up (range, 6-30 months; median, 13 months), two (6%) patients developed local progression and five (14%) developed distant or regional lymph node metastases. Two-year overall survival rates for total patients and medically operable patients were 58 and 83%, respectively. In conclusion, this new irradiation technique, utilizing patient-controlled radiation beam switching under self-breath-hold after precise alignment of the isocenter, allows safe high-dose stereotactic radiotherapy with sufficient margins around the CTV and reduced treatment times. Based on the initial results, excellent local control with minimal complications is expected for stage I NSCLC. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

This report deals with the commissioning of metal compensators and the first experiences in clinical use. Dosimetric accuracy, dose coverage and practical experience like treatment delivery time, monitor units and dose outside the treated volume are evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to April 2004, 24 patients with head-and-neck cancers were treated with 3D-c-IMRT using tin-wax compensators. The dose prescription included a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB). High-dose volume was irradiated with 60-70 Gy (median 66 Gy), low-dose volume with 48-54 Gy (median 52 Gy) administered by a standardized seven- portal coplanar beam arrangement. Dose at one parotid gland was aimed at 26 Gy. The compensators used consisted of tin granules embedded in wax; recalculation was performed with compensators made of the alloy MCP96 as well. RESULTS: In 21 of 24 patients 3D-c-IMRT with tin-wax compensators reduced the median dose to one parotid gland to < 30 Gy. Recalculation with compensators with higher density which allowed higher attenuation revealed better protection of the parotid gland. The treatment delivery time per fraction was between 6 and 12 min (plus time for patient positioning), approximately 300 MU per 2 Gy were applied. The dose outside the treated volume was increased with regard to open fields and comparable with a physical wedge of 15-30 degrees . Quality assurance and treatment of patient were fast and simple. It was shown, that calculated dose distribution corresponded to measured dose distribution with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: The described method offers facilities for a good dose coverage of irregular target volumes with different prescribed doses and a considerable dose reduction in adjacent organs at risk. The dose sparing of organs at risk can be further improved, if a compensator material with higher density is used

The results of a study are presented showing how detailed diagnostic information available from MRI is helpful in defining the target volume to be irradiated and the critical normal structures. By using 3-dimensional planning techniques, an assessment was made of the relative merits of proton beam therapy and of X ray treatment for patients with early stage and locally advanced carcinoma of the nasopharynx. For both types of patient, the study suggests that the use of protons for the major part of treatment results in a more even distribution of dose to the tumor and an increase of approximately 5 Gy in median tumor dose with substantial reductions in doses to adjacent normal tissues. The superior dose distributions possible with protons should translate into improved local control and reduced morbidity. The difficulties of proton treatment planning for this site are addressed

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In prostate cancer it is estimated that annually about 300 patients and in gynaecological cancer about 50 patients, are candidates for proton beam therapy. Owing to major uncertainties, it has not been possible to give an estimate of the number of potential patients with urinary bladder cancer. [References: 61]

DESIGN: In a retrospective, nonrandomized cohort study, 21 patients with extra-large choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanomas measuring at least 10 mm in maximum thickness or 20 mm in maximum basal diameter or tumors located within 3 mm of the optic nerve measuring at least 8 mm in maximum thickness or 16 mm in maximum basal diameter met inclusion criteria. Main outcome measures were frequency of (1) anterior segment complications (lash loss, keratopathy, cataract, and neovascular glaucoma), (2) posterior segment complications (vitreous hemorrhage, radiation retinopathy, and radiation papillopathy), (3) treatment failure (tumor growth, enucleation, or metastases), and (4) final visual acuity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Mean age at treatment was 58.3 years. The frequencies of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 14.3% and 9.5%, respectively. Mean tumor thickness and mean basal diameter were 8.6 mm and 18.7 mm, respectively. Lash loss occurred in 52.4%; dry eye, in 23.8%; cataract, in 28.6%; neovascular glaucoma, in 38.1% (100% in patients with diabetes mellitus); radiation retinopathy, in 9.5%; and radiation papillopathy, in 9.5%. No patient developed radiation-associated scleral necrosis or vitreous hemorrhage. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of local tumor growth after treatment was 33%, and the rate of distant metastasis was 10%. Visual acuity of 20/200 or better was preserved in 25% of patients, including 4 patients (19%) who experienced an average of 4 lines of Snellen visual acuity improvement. Development of neovascular glaucoma was associated with tumors in close proximity to the optic nerve (P = .04), while cataract (P = .03) and lash loss (P = .02) occurred with more anteriorly located tumors. Proton beam radiotherapy provided a 67% probability of local control and 90% probability of clinically discernible metastases-free survival at 24 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy is an ocular-conserving option that may be considered for the treatment of extra-large uveal melanoma in carefully selected patients

Taking the peak skin score as an endpoint, the radiobiological effects [relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and time-dose relationships] of the proton beam in multi-fractionated treatments were estimated. Factors influencing the skin dose, such as the prescribed tumor dose, tumor site, and number of applied fields, were also analyzed. The following conclusions regarding acute skin reactions to the clinical use of proton irradiation were obtained: 1) the physical skin-sparing effect of proton irradiation in single-field irradiation, especially in superficial regions, is not large compared with that of high-energy photon irradiation; 2) multidirectional proton irradiation significantly reduced the skin dose and severity of acute reactions; 3) the radiobiological effects of the proton beam, RBE and the time factor, estimated in human skin in multi-fractional treatment were slightly smaller than those of X-rays, i.e., 0.92 and -0.25 +/- 0.09, respectively

Fast neutron therapy included treatment with neutrons alone, a neutron boost after photon therapy, or a schedule of alternating neutron and photon treatments (mixed beam). The results with mixed beam irradiation were superior to those obtained with the other neutron therapy techniques, and compared favorably with the results of standard treatment methods. However, the lack of a conclusive advantage for neutron therapy in this pilot study illustrates the need for on-going randomized clinical trials

Survival rates, patterns of failure and prognostic factors were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients with follicle centre lymphoma stage I and II were treated between 1970 and 1999 in Dresden. Therapy modalities were radiotherapy alone (103 patients) or combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (13 patients). Radiotherapy was applied as involved-field-(IFI)- (104 patients), extended-field- (nine patients) or total-nodal- (three patients) irradiation. Patients received doses between 25 Gy and 50 Gy (median 35 Gy). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were 76% and 51%. Relapse free survival was 62% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up was 4,0 years. Relapses after complete remission were registered in 44 cases. Six patients have had in-field-recurrences. The majority of out-field-recurrences were nodal relapses (50%). 11% of relapses occurred outside of lymph nodes or were disseminated failures (18%). Significant favorable prognostic factors identified by multivariate and univariate analysis were low age (age < 50 years vs. age > 50 years), low stage and performance of bipedal lymphangiography as primary staging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is an effective and tolerable treatment modality for follicle centre lymphoma in the early stages I and II. We registered a high proportion of nodal recurrences, which may be minimized by prophylactic extended radiotherapy

0	524	Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification	Algorithms, Calibration, Humans, Ions, Male, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation	The aim of this study was to demonstrate how dosimetry with an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) replaced film and ionization chamber measurements for routine pre-treatment dosimetry in our clinic. Furthermore, we described how EPID dosimetry was used to solve a clinical problem. IMRT prostate plans were delivered to a homogeneous slab phantom. EPID transit images were acquired for each segment. A previously developed in-house back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom mid-plane (intersecting the isocenter). Segment dose images were summed to obtain an EPID mid-plane dose image for each field. Fields were compared using profiles and in two dimensions with the y evaluation (criteria: 3%/3 mm). To quantify results, the average gamma (gamma avg), maximum gamma (gamma max), and the percentage of points with gamma < 1(P gamma < 1) were calculated within the 20% isodose line of each field. For 10 patient plans, all fields were measured with EPID and film at gantry set to 0 degrees. The film was located in the phantom coronal mid-plane (10 cm depth), and compared with the back-projected EPID mid-plane absolute dose. EPID and film measurements agreed well for all 50 fields, with (gamma avg) =0.16, (gamma max)=1.00, and (P gamma < 1)= 100%. Based on these results, film measurements were discontinued for verification of prostate IMRT plans. For 20 patient plans, the dose distribution was re-calculated with the phantom CT scan and delivered to the phantom with the original gantry angles. The planned isocenter dose (plan(iso)) was verified with the EPID (EPID(iso)) and an ionization chamber (IC(iso)). The average ratio, (EPID(iso)/IC(iso)), was 1.00 (0.01 SD). Both measurements were systematically lower than planned, with (EPID(iso)/plan(iso)) and (IC(iso)/plan(iso))=0.99 (0.01 SD). EPID mid-plane dose images for each field were also compared with the corresponding plane derived from the three dimensional (3D) dose grid calculated with the phantom CT scan. Comparisons of 100 fields yielded (gamma avg)=0.39, gamma max=2.52, and (P gamma < 1)=98.7%. Seven plans revealed under-dosage in individual fields ranging from 5% to 16%, occurring at small regions of overlapping segments or along the junction of abutting segments (tongue-and-groove side). Test fields were designed to simulate errors and gave similar results. The agreement was improved after adjusting an incorrectly set tongue-and-groove width parameter in the treatment planning system (TPS), reducing (gamma max) from 2.19 to 0.80 for the test field. Mid-plane dose distributions determined with the EPID were consistent with film measurements in a slab phantom for all IMRT fields. Isocenter doses of the total plan measured with an EPID and an ionization chamber also agreed. The EPID can therefore replace these dosimetry devices for field-by-field and isocenter IMRT pre-treatment verification. Systematic errors were detected using EPID dosimetry, resulting in the adjustment of a TPS parameter and alteration of two clinical patient plans. One set of EPID measurements (i.e., one open and transit image acquired for each segment of the plan) is sufficient to check each IMRT plan field-by-field and at the isocenter, making it a useful, efficient, and accurate dosimetric tool

After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

The authors evaluated whether these differences manifest themselves in the clinical outcome of patients and assessed the value of incorporating 1H-MRS imaging-derived spatial information into the treatment planning process for gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Twenty-six patients harboring Grade IV gliomas who had previously been treated with external-beam radiation therapy were evaluated by comparing the radiosurgically treated lesion volume with the volume of metabolically active tumor defined on 1H-MRS imaging. The cohort was evenly divided into two groups based on the percentage of overlap between the radiosurgical target and the metabolic lesion volumes. Patients with a percentage of overlap greater than 50% with respect to the metabolic lesion volume were classified as low risk and those with an overlap less than 50% were classified as high risk. Kaplan-Meier estimators were calculated using time to progression and survival as dependent variables. The metabolite levels within the metabolic lesion were significantly greater than those within the radiosurgical target (p < or = 0.001). The median survival was 15.7 months for patients in the low-risk group and 10.4 months for those in the high-risk group. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results of this study indicates that patients undergoing GKS may benefit from the inclusion of 1H-MRS imaging in the treatment planning process

[Review] [27 refs] [German]	Calibration, Carbon, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods]	Since December 1997, patients are treated with carbon ions at GSI (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung). Dose delivery is performed with the intensity-controlled raster-scanning technique, which allows a highly conformal treatment of the tumor. To meet the special requirements of dosimetry with heavy ion beams, new dosimetric measurement techniques were developed and introduced into clinical application by the DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum). The techniques comprise calibration of the irradiation monitor, checks of lateral and depth dose profiles, as well as verification of the beam delivery for complex three-dimensional dose distributions. The developed dosimetric methods are now integral part of clinical application and enable safe treatment with carbon ion therapy. [References: 27]

The rate of complete angiographic obliteration 2 years after radiation was 94% in those lesions smaller than 4 cm3 (2.0 cm in diameter), 75% for those 4-25 cm3 and 39% for those larger than 25 cm3 (3.7 cm in diameter); at 3 years after radiation, the corresponding obliteration rates were 100, 95 and 70%. Major clinical complications occurred in 10 patients (8 permanent, 2 transient) between 3 and 21 months after treatment; all were in the initial stage of the protocol (higher radiation doses). 10 patients bled from residual malformation between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures were improved in 63% and headaches in 68% of patients. Excellent or good clinical outcome was achieved in 94% of patients. Compared to the natural history and risks of surgery for these difficult malformations, we consider these results encouraging. Heavy-charged-particle radiation is a valuable therapy for surgically inaccessible symptomatic cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: the prolonged latent period before complete obliteration and the small risk of serious neurological complications

The investigated parameters were leaf width in the MLC, leaf transmission, related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. Seven head-and-neck patients with stage T1-T3N0-N2cM0 oropharyngeal cancer were studied. For each patient nine plans were made with a different set of linac/MLC parameters. The plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) v7.6c and PLATO RTS v2.6.4, ITP v1.1.8. A hypothetical ideal linac/MLC was introduced to investigate the influence of one parameter at a time without interaction of other parameters. When any of the three parameters was increased from the ideal set-up values (leaf width 2.5 mm, transmission 0%, penumbra 3 mm), the mean dose to the parotid glands increased, given the same tumour coverage. The largest increase was found for increasing leaf transmission. The investigation showed that by changing more than one parameter of the ideal linac/MLC set-up, the increase in the mean dose was smaller than the sum of dose increments for each parameter separately. As a reference to clinical practice, we also optimized the plans of the seven patients with the clinically used Elekta SLi 15, equipped with a standard MLC with a leaf width of 10 mm. As compared to the ideal linac, this resulted in an increase of the average dose to the parotid glands of 5.8 Gy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1992 and April 1993, 74 patients received external beam radiation treatment to the prostate +/- nodes, generally with a four-field box technique. Forty-four of the 74 patients had a custom-made hemibody foam cast used in an attempt to improve setup accuracy. A review of the routine weekly port films was performed following the completion of therapy to determine the reproducibility of patient setup in all 74 patients. The physician's request of an isocenter shift was used as an indicator of reproducibility. Neither the treating technologists nor the physicians knew at the time the films were taken that the port films would be reviewed for setup reproducibility at a later date. The results were compared between the patients treated with (44) and without (30) an immobilization device. RESULTS: In the 44 immobilized patients, 213 routine checks of the isocenter were performed during the 7-week course of radiation therapy. In 17.4% of these instances (37 out of 213), an isocenter shift was requested. This rate is compared to 23.1% (30 out of 130) in the 30 patients who did not have the immobilization device (p < 0.2). There was a statistically significant reduction in isocenter shifts requested in the anterior to posterior direction in the patients who were immobilized, 5.1% (9 out of 175) vs. 12.6% (13 out of 103) (p < 0.05, two tailed chi-square test). There was no significant improvement in the reproducibility of isocenter placement in the cephalad to caudal or right to left directions. CONCLUSIONS: This custom-made hemibody foam cradle appears to improve the reproducibility of patient setup during the 7-week course of fractionated external beam irradiation for patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This type of immobilization device is now routinely used in our clinic and is recommended for all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. These devices are likely to be particularly useful when contemplating dose escalation to minimize the volume of bladder and rectum included in the treatment fields

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1981 and 1988, 15 patients with craniopharyngioma were treated in part or entirely with fractionated 160 MeV proton beam therapy. The group consisted of 5 children (median age, 15.9 years) and 10 adults (median age, 36.2 years). Median dose prescribed to the tumor was 56.9 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE). The median proton component was 26.9 CGE. Patients were treated after documented recurrence after initial surgery (n = 6) or after subtotal resection or biopsy (n = 9). None had had prior radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median observation period of surviving patients (n = 11) was 13.1 years from radiotherapy. One patient was lost to follow-up with tumor control after 5.2 years. Actuarial 10-year survival rate was 72%. Four patients have died 5-9.1 years after treatment, two from local failure. Actuarial 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. The functional status of the living adult patients is unaltered from their preradiotherapy status; all of them continued leading normal or near normal working lives. None of the patients treated as a child had experienced recurrence of tumor. One child shows learning difficulties and slight retardation, comparable to his preradiotherapy status. The others have professional achievements within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Results in terms of survival and local control are comparable with other contemporary series. Although no formal neuropsychological testing was performed, the surrogate measures of lifestyle and professional accomplishments appear to be satisfactory

1	869	Medical aspects of the National Centre For Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO-Centro Nazionale Adroterapia Oncologica) in Italy	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Italy, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Registries	More than 20 hadrontherapy centres are active in the world and about 40,000 patients have been treated, almost 4000 with ions. Physical selectivity and high relative biologic efficiency (RBE) represent the rationale for using ions in the treatment of tumours. The clinical results are very promising and justify the construction of new centres. We present the main characteristics of CNAO (Centro Nazionale Adroterapia Oncologica) and its possible integration in a nationwide network. The Italian project started in 1991 thanks to the activity of the TERA Foundation and was financed by the Italian Government in 2002. The CNAO will be built in Pavia to start clinical activity in 2007. The equipment will include a synchrotron and 3 treatment rooms mainly devoted to carbon ions but able to deliver also protons. The Centre should be able to deliver up to 20,000 fractions / year. The realization of CNAO is part of a more ambitious project to set up an integrated national network. The need of hadrontherapy centres is defined by epidemiological studies based on Italian tumour registries showing that almost 900 patients can be electively treated with protontherapy and about 10,000 could be included in clinical trials. Considering that ions could be used for radioresistant tumours that affect about 25,000 new patients/year, we estimate that 10-15%, i.e. 3000-4000 patients would benefit from ion therapy. The realization of a nationwide network possibly linked to a larger European network will be very helpful in making available hadrontherapy for a large part of the population

Fast neutrons, 30 MeV d-Be, were used to treat patients who had malignant melanoma in order to confirm the biological effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation for tumor control. Seventy-two patients suffering from malignant melanoma participated in the clinical trials with fast neutrons between November 1975 and December 1986. Of 72 patients, 45 had melanoma of the skin, 20 had melanoma of the head and neck, and seven had choroidal melanoma. Five-year survival rate of the patients who had previously untreated melanoma of the skin was 61% and for patients who received postoperative irradiation, it was 35.7% whereas no patients who had recurrent tumor survived over 4 years. Of 22 patients who had melanoma of the skin, stage I, local control in four cases was achieved by irradiation alone, whereas local control was achieved in 17 of 18 patients who required salvage surgery after fast-neutron therapy. The results of pathological studies performed with specimens obtained from salvage surgery have shown that melanoma cells growing in intradermal tissue are radio-resistant, compared with cells growing in intraepidermal tissue. This might suggest that melanoma cells acquire radioresistance when the connective tissue is involved. Five-year survival rate of the patients who had locally advanced melanoma of the head and neck, previously untreated, was 15.4%. Radiation therapy with accelerated protons was suitable for patients suffering from choroidal melanoma

Most published clinical trials have confirmed hemoglobin to possess a significant influence on survival in patients treated with radiotherapy. In our study we have investigated the prognostic value of hemoglobin in a combined modality schedule. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with advanced head and neck tumors were treated with combined radio-chemotherapy. The therapy comprised 2 courses of induction chemotherapy with ifosfamide (1,500 mg/m2, day 1 to 5) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2, day 5) followed by hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a total dose of only 30 Gy. Surgery involved tumor resection and neck dissection. RESULTS: The 1-year overall survival rate and the 2-year survival rate were 79% and 56%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 68% and 49%, respectively. Prognostic factors with an impact on survival were seen in tumor size (T3 vs T4, p = 0.0088), response to radio-chemotherapy at the primary site (no vital tumor rest vs vital tumor rest, p = 0.045), response to lymph node radio-chemotherapy (no vital tumor cells vs vital tumor cells, p = 0.013) and level of hemoglobin after radio-chemotherapy (Hb > or = 11.5 g/dl vs < 11.5 g/dl, p = 0.0084). CONCLUSION: In our study hemoglobin level after radio-chemotherapy was identified for the first time to be also a significant prognostic factor (univariate analysis) in head and neck cancer patients who underwent combined radio-chemotherapy. Besides chemotherapy plus low-dose irradiation achieved similar results in comparison with radical resection and high-dose radiotherapy at least for the first 2 years after therapy. Relapsing disease could be treated with 1 additional course of radiotherapy which is supposed to be well tolerated

The most common histological types are adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas and malignant mixed tumors. The results of conventional radiotherapy are suboptimal in inoperable or incompletely resected salivary gland tumors and in recurrent disease. The pooled data of some international series for low linear energy transfer radiation show a local control of 28%. Especially in advanced tumors neutron therapy can improve local control and should be the treatment of choice. The clinical data from different therapy centers in Europe show local control of 67% in gross disease. [References: 44]

The choice of therapy depends on many factors, and plaque radiotherapy is often used. OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcome of plaque radiotherapy in the management of ciliary body melanoma and to identify the risk factors associated with the development of radiation complications, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and melanoma-related death after plaque radiotherapy of ciliary body melanoma. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical records of 136 patients with ciliary body melanoma who were treated with plaque radiotherapy between July 1976 and June 1992. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the most frequent radiation complication at 5 years' follow-up was cataract, developing in 48% of the patients, followed by neovascular glaucoma (21%), retinopathy (20%), scleral necrosis (12%), and vitreous hemorrhage (11%). Visual acuity decrease (by > or =3 Snellen lines) was noted in 40% of the patients at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 8% of the patients developed recurrence, 28% had metastasis, and 22% died of melanoma-related causes by 5 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the factors predictive of radiation cataract were superonasal (P = .003) and inferior tumor meridian (P = .02) compared with inferonasal meridian and apex dose rate greater than 57 cGy/h (P = .05). The development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly related to iris involvement with the ciliary body tumor (P<.001). The factors predictive of development of radiation retinopathy were base dose rate greater than 230 cGy/h (P = .03) and the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = .05). The only predictor of metastasis was tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02). The risk factors for melanoma-related death were the presence of metastasis (P<.001), tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02), and recurrence (P = .02). Multivariate analyses showed that the most significant variables predictive of the development of scleral necrosis were intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .007). The most significant predictive factors for vitreous hemorrhage were visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 (P = .02) and intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P = .02). The best subset of independent predictors of vision decrease were mushroom tumor shape (P = .002), age older than 61 years (P = .006), and superonasal meridian (P = .04). The risks for melanoma-related death were presence of metastasis (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .01). There was no group of significant variables predictive for radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plaque radiotherapy offers 92% 5-year local control rate for ciliary body melanoma. Metastasis occurs in 28% of the patients treated with this method by 5 years. Patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in thickness are at greater risk than patients with thinner tumors for metastatic disease and melanoma-related death. Major radiation complications include radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, and scleral necrosis

RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the most frequent radiation complication at 5 years' follow-up was cataract, developing in 48% of the patients, followed by neovascular glaucoma (21%), retinopathy (20%), scleral necrosis (12%), and vitreous hemorrhage (11%). Visual acuity decrease (by > or =3 Snellen lines) was noted in 40% of the patients at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 8% of the patients developed recurrence, 28% had metastasis, and 22% died of melanoma-related causes by 5 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the factors predictive of radiation cataract were superonasal (P = .003) and inferior tumor meridian (P = .02) compared with inferonasal meridian and apex dose rate greater than 57 cGy/h (P = .05). The development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly related to iris involvement with the ciliary body tumor (P<.001). The factors predictive of development of radiation retinopathy were base dose rate greater than 230 cGy/h (P = .03) and the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = .05). The only predictor of metastasis was tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02). The risk factors for melanoma-related death were the presence of metastasis (P<.001), tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02), and recurrence (P = .02). Multivariate analyses showed that the most significant variables predictive of the development of scleral necrosis were intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .007). The most significant predictive factors for vitreous hemorrhage were visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 (P = .02) and intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P = .02). The best subset of independent predictors of vision decrease were mushroom tumor shape (P = .002), age older than 61 years (P = .006), and superonasal meridian (P = .04). The risks for melanoma-related death were presence of metastasis (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .01). There was no group of significant variables predictive for radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plaque radiotherapy offers 92% 5-year local control rate for ciliary body melanoma. Metastasis occurs in 28% of the patients treated with this method by 5 years. Patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in thickness are at greater risk than patients with thinner tumors for metastatic disease and melanoma-related death. Major radiation complications include radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, and scleral necrosis

METHODS: The head of the patient was immobilized by an individual cast mask. The target volume and adjacent critical structures were three-dimensionally segmented based on ophthalmological findings and MRI. The beam angles were optimized by a beam's eye view technique with a micro-multileaf collimator. We use a linear accelerator with 6-MeV photons. A patient was treated in a phase I/II trial with a single dose of 22.5 Gy. RESULTS: The accuracy of stereotactic positioning of the eye was 0.8 mm. The dose gradients were 15% mm. It was possible to spare the lens and the lacrimal gland in all cases. The treatment with four to six fields took 35-50 min and was tolerated without acute complications. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a new method to treat choroid metastases by stereotactic radiotherapy. This method allows to concentrate the dose to the target and to spare adjacent critical structures. One of the advantages of this noninvasive treatment is the short treatment time. The clinical role of this method has to be evaluated based on long-term results of tumor control and visual outcome in these patients

In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression

METHODS AND MATERIAL: The 3D dose distributions were analyzed in 85 patients with cervical vertebral tumors. Mean follow-up was 41.3 months. The mean prescribed dose was 76.3 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE = proton dose x RBE 1.1). Dose constraints to the center and the surface of the cervical cord were 55-58 CGE and 67-70 CGE, respectively. Dose parameters, DVH and EUD, were calculated for each patient. The spinal cord toxicity was graded using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late effects scoring system. RESULTS: Thirteen patients experienced Grade 1-2 toxicity. Four patients had Grade 3 toxicity. For the dose range used in this study, none of the dosimetric parameters was found to be associated with the observed distribution of cord toxicities. The only factor significantly associated with cord toxicity was the number of surgeries before irradiation. CONCLUSION: The data and our analysis suggest that the integrity of the normal musculoskeletal supportive tissues and vascular supply may be important confounding factors of toxicity at these dose levels. The results also indicate that the cervical spinal cord dose constraints used in treating these patients are appropriate for conformal proton-photon radiotherapy

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers

Twenty patients had high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). After treatment 18 of 20 AVMs (90%) showed a significant reduction in size on angiograms or MR images. Eleven of 20 (55%) had complete resolution on angiograms or MR images, 35% had partial resolution, and 10% showed no size change. Before treatment, the size range of the AVMs was 0.86-383 cm3 (median, 21.7 cm3). Smaller AVMs (less than 8 cm3) were more likely to resolve completely than medium-sized AVMs (8-64 cm3) or larger AVMs (greater than 64 cm3). Four additional patients had slow-flow vascular malformations: One had a venous angioma; one, a probable cavernous hemangioma; and two, malformations that were not seen on angiograms. CT proved inaccurate in demonstrating the boundaries of the AVM after treatment because it showed persistent contrast enhancement even when the AVM was completely obliterated on angiograms. MR imaging and angiography were complementary in the evaluation of therapeutic results and should be the primary modalities in the examination of patients with AVMs

Record-linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register identified 99 new cancers more than 2 years after 131I therapy [standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.75] vs 122 (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.88-1.42) in patients not receiving 131I. In females treated with 131I overall SIR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.14-1.83) and significantly elevated were noted for tumours of the salivary glands, genital organs, kidney and adrenal gland. No elevated risk of a subsequent breast cancer or leukaemia was noted. SIR did not change over time, arguing against a strong radiation effect of 131I. Organs that were estimated to have received more than 1.0 Gy had together a significantly increased risk of a subsequent cancer following 131I treatment (SIR = 2.59; n = 18). A significant trend was seen for increasing activities of 131I with highest risk for patients exposed to greater than or equal to 3,664 MBq (SIR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.20-2.58). No specific cancer or group of cancers could be convincingly linked to high-dose 131I exposures since SIR did not increase after 10 years of observation. However, upper confidence intervals could not exclude levels of risk that would be predicted based on data from the study of atomic bomb survivors. We conclude that the current practice of extrapolating the effects of high-dose exposures to lower-dose situations is unlikely to seriously underestimate radiation hazards for low LET radiation

For this and other reasons, robots were incorporated into the treatment room systems at MPRI. METHODS: The Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute (MPRI) is the first radiotherapy facility in the United States to use commercial robots with six degrees of freedom for patient positioning, rather than a traditional bed with four degrees of freedom. RESULTS: This paper outlines the ways in which robots are used at MPRI and attempts to distil insights from the experience of treating over 200 radiotherapy patients with a robotic system from February 2004 to late 2006. CONCLUSIONS: The system has performed well, and with great reliability, but there is room for future improvement, especially in ease of use and in reducing the time to get patients into position.

[Review] [104 refs]	Alpha Particles, Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Antibodies,Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use], Astatine, Astatine/tu [Therapeutic Use], Brachytherapy, DNA, DNA/me [Metabolism], Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radioimmunotherapy, Radiotherapy, Research, Silicon, Tissue Distribution, Universities	Targeted radiotherapy or endoradiotherapy is an appealing approach to cancer treatment because of the potential for delivering curative doses of radiation to tumor while sparing normal tissues. Radionuclides that decay by the emission of alpha-particles such as the heavy halogen astatine-211 (211At) offer the exciting prospect of combining cell-specific molecular targets with radiation having a range in tissue of only a few cell diameters. Herein, the radiobiological advantages of alpha-particle targeted radiotherapy will be reviewed, and the rationale for using 211At for this purpose will be described. The chemistry of astatine is similar to that of iodine; however, there are important differences which make the synthesis and evaluation of 211At-labeled compounds more challenging. Perhaps the most successful approach that has been developed involves the astatodemetallation of tin, silicon or mercury precursors. Astatine-211 labeled agents that have been investigated for targeted radiotherapy include [211At]astatide, 211At- labeled particulates, 211At-labeled naphthoquinone derivatives, 211At-labeled methylene blue, 211At-labeled DNA precursors, meta-[211At]astatobenzylguanidine, 211At-labeled biotin conjugates, 211At-labeled bisphosphonates, and 211At-labeled antibodies and antibody fragments. The status of these 211At-labeled compounds will be discussed in terms of their labeling chemistry, cytotoxicity in cell culture, as well as their tissue distribution and therapeutic efficacy in animal models of human cancers. Finally, an update on the status of the first clinical trial with an 211At-labeled targeted therapeutic, 211At-labeled chimeric anti-tenascin antibody 81C6, will be provided. [References: 104]

The treatable protocol depth (TPD) was utilized as an evaluation index. MCNP-4B calculations were performed for near-threshold (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be at a proton energy of 1.900MeV and for a polyethylene BDE. Consequently, the TPD was increased by increasing T/N ratio, i.e., the ratio of the (10)B concentration in the tumor ((10)B(Tumor)) to that in the normal tissue ((10)B(Normal)), and by increasing (10)B(Tumor) and (10)B(Normal) for constant T/N ratio. It has been found that the BDE becomes unnecessary from the viewpoint of increasing the TPD, when (10)B(Tumor) is over a certain level

However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

Eleven evaluable patients with the following histologies were treated: 7 poorly differentiated, 2 with histiocytic, 1 with mixed lymphoma and 1 with well-differentiated morphology. CHOP was given in the following manner: cyclophosphamide 400 mg/M2 IV day 1, adriamycin 40 mg/M2 IV day 1, vincristine 2 mg IV day 1, and Prednisone 100 mg po daily X 5. Forty-five rad total body irradiation was delivered in three fractions on days 21, 23 and 25. Chemotherapy was repeated on day 42, etc., until four cycles of CHOP and three cycles TBI (135R) were delivered. Responses were seen in 8/11 patients (6 CR and 2 PR); 5 persons are currently alive and 6 are dead. Two of the living patients are alive with disease and the remainder are in unmaintained remission. Two persons died with no response and one died in complete remission of an unrelated illness. The median duration of remission is 15 months and the median survival for all patients is 48 months. The therapy was well tolerated with a mean nadir leukocyte count of 3,020 X 10(9)/microliters (range 1.2-5.5) and a mean nadir platelet count of 188 X 10(9)/microliters (range 016-270).

The volume to be irradiated is usually identified on radiographs or on x-ray computed tomography (CT) sections. Magnetic resonance (MR)-derived images of the proton T2 relaxation times in small pixel elements, typically 0.5 mm2 or less, provide significantly sharper differentiation between normal and diseased tissue. The T2 values in tissue depend on the tissue composition, histologic condition, and physiologic environment within the tumor. Furthermore, for many tumors the histogram of T2 values has a clear biphasic distribution suggesting that T2 maps may be useful for the identification of necrotic or hypoxic regions within tumors. The distribution of T2 values within the tumor bed shows the general pattern that the T2 values are elevated with a range greater than that seen in normal muscle. Elevated T2 values are not by themselves diagnostic of malignancy; however, they demonstrate the heterogeneity of the microenvironment present within a tumor. The spatial distribution of T2 values is being explored as a method for computer assistance in the delineation of the target volume for treatment planning. In addition, MR P-31 spectroscopic examinations were performed on 30 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Although hampered by muscle contamination in some P-31 spectra obtained with surface coil profile localization techniques, significant trends can still be appreciated in our data. These trends include the following: (1) the P-31 spectra from malignant tissue have well-resolved spectral lines in the upfield region that correspond to Pi, phosphomonoester (PME), and phosphodiester (PDE) not usually seen in normal muscle; (2) the PDE/B-ATP and PME/B-ATP ratios are greater than unity in all cases; and (3) most of the tumors have higher PME peaks than PDE peaks. The P-31 spectra from patients treated with ionizing radiation changed during and after therapy. Some of the changes could be associated with alteration of the tumor metabolic activity or synthesis and breakdown of lipoproteins. These studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies may be useful for both radiotherapy treatment planning and the noninvasive monitoring of patients both before and during treatment

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1989 and December 1993, 120 consecutive patients underwent linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery, and univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median survival time was 32 weeks. Progressive brain metastases, both local and regional, caused 25 of 104 deaths. Patients with two metastases (n = 30) or a solitary metastasis (n = 70) had equivalent actuarial survival times (P = .07; median, 37 weeks; maximum, 211+ weeks). Patients treated to three or more metastases (n = 20) had significantly shorter survival times (P < .002; median, 14 weeks; maximum, 63 weeks). Prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival included a pretreatment Karnofsky performance status > or = 70% and fewer than three metastases. Delayed radiation necrosis at the treated site developed in 20 patients and correlated with prior or concurrent delivery of whole-brain irradiation and the logarithm of the tumor volume. CONCLUSION: Survival duration is equivalent for patients with one or two brain metastases and is similar to that reported for patients with a solitary metastasis managed by surgical resection and whole-brain irradiation. Survival after radiosurgery for three or more metastases was similar to that reported for whole-brain irradiation

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1989 and December 1993, 120 consecutive patients underwent linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery, and univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median survival time was 32 weeks. Progressive brain metastases, both local and regional, caused 25 of 104 deaths. Patients with two metastases (n = 30) or a solitary metastasis (n = 70) had equivalent actuarial survival times (P = .07; median, 37 weeks; maximum, 211+ weeks). Patients treated to three or more metastases (n = 20) had significantly shorter survival times (P < .002; median, 14 weeks; maximum, 63 weeks).

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

The primary endpoints of local control and the documentation of any MRI T2-weighted changes in contiguous brain tissues are discussed. METHODS: Between 1/95 and 1/97, 19 patients were planned with the X-Knife 3-D planning system (Radionics, Burlington, Mass., USA) and received a median dose of 46 Gy in daily 2.0-Gy fractions. Treatments were delivered stereotactically with a dedicated 600SR linear accelerator (Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Immobilization was achieved with the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame. The mean tumor size was 2.24 cm. The mean prescription isodose was 87%. The mean age was 53 years (10 male, 9 female). The mean follow-up time was 10 months (range 1-24 months). The mean optic chiasm and brain stem doses were calculated at 38 and 13 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postgadolinum-enhanced MRI scans and Humphrey visual field tests. RESULTS: In the posttreatment period, local control (absence of tumor progression) has been achieved in all of the patients. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. No acute complications, no visual changes and no T2-weighted MRI or proton density changes were documented in any of the 19 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that SRT compares favorably with conventional radiotherapy in achieving local control. The doses to the brainstem and the temporal lobes are significantly decreased and at early follow-up no white matter changes are seen on MRI after SRT. The true frequency of grade 1-4 changes are likely underestimated as similar changes often occur in association with tumor edema or after surgery. Given the uncertain neurocognitive significance of the white matter changes associated with treating these benign tumors by conventional radiotherapy, we are currently treating all pituitary adenomas with fractionated SRT to reduce the potential sequelae

The current paradigm requires stereotactic head ring placement for the patient's first fraction. The stereotactic coordinates and treatment plan are determined relative to this head ring. The IRLEDs are attached to the patient via a maxillary bite plate, and the position of the IRLEDs relative to linac isocenter is saved to file. These positions are then recalled for each subsequent treatment to position the patient for fractionated therapy. The purpose of this article was to report a method of predicting the desired IRLED locations without need for the invasive head ring. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To achieve the goal of frameless optic-guided radiotherapy, a method is required for direct localization of the IRLED positions from a CT scan. Because it is difficult to localize the exact point of light emission from a CT scan of an IRLED, a new bite plate was designed that contains eight aluminum fiducial markers along with the six IRLEDs. After a calibration procedure to establish the spatial relationship of the IRLEDs to the aluminum fiducial markers, the stereotactic coordinates of the IRLED light emission points are determined by localizing the aluminum fiducial markers in a stereotactic CT scan. RESULTS: To test the accuracy of direct CT determination of the IRLED positions, phantom tests were performed. The average accuracy of isocenter localization using the IRLED bite plate was 0.65 +/- 0. 17 mm for these phantom tests. In addition, the optic-guided system has a unique compatibility with the stereotactic head ring. Therefore, the isocentric localization capability was clinically tested using the stereotactic head ring as the absolute standard. The ongoing clinical trial has shown the frameless system to provide a patient localization accuracy of 1.11 +/- 0.3 mm compared with the head ring. CONCLUSION: Optic-guided radiotherapy using IRLEDs provides a mechanism through which setup accuracy may be improved over conventional techniques. To date, this optic-guided therapy has been used only as a hybrid system that requires use of the stereotactic head ring for the first fraction. This has limited its use in the routine clinical setting. Computation of the desired IRLED positions eliminates the need for the invasive head ring for the first fraction. This allows application of optic-guided therapy to a larger cohort of patients, and also facilitates the initiation of extracranial optic-guided radiotherapy

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordoma is a challenge. The authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordoma and 10 patients with chondrosarcoma. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%, respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordoma) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with worst RFS rates as compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy, followed by CSF leakages were the most frequent postoperative complication. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma.

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordoma is a challenge. The authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordoma and 10 patients with chondrosarcoma. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%, respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordoma) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with worst RFS rates as compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy, followed by CSF leakages were the most frequent postoperative complication. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and the patient's age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy provided better prognosis for these patients

1	742	Rationale for using multiple antioxidants in protecting humans against low doses of ionizing radiation.

In addition, the expression of radiation-induced damage in humans not only depends upon total dose, dose rate, linear energy transfer (LET), and fractionation and protraction of total doses, but also on repair mechanisms, bystander effects, and exposure to chemical carcinogens, tumour promoters and other toxins. It also depends upon the levels of anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumour promoting agents. Low doses of ionizing radiation should not be considered insignificant with regard to increasing the incidence of somatic mutations (neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases) and heritable mutations in humans owing to its interaction with other toxins that can enhance damage produced by irradiation. It is very prudent to continue to support the well-established radiobiological concept that no radiation dose can be considered completely safe, and that all efforts must be made to reduce both the radiation dose and biological damage, no matter how small that damage might be, without sacrificing the benefits of radiation. Based on the results of many scientific experiments, formulations containing multiple antioxidants for biological protection against radiation damage in humans can be developed, and this strategy together with the existing physical concept of radiation protection, should further reduce potential risks of low doses of ionizing radiation in humans.

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors.

1	157	What is the role of radiation in the treatment of subfoveal membranes: review of radiobiologic, pathologic, and other considerations to initiate a multimodality discussion.

All schedules successfully controlled membrane progression, stabilized vision in most patients, and increased visual acuity in some. Conformal protons also decreased the radiation dose to healthy tissues outside the designated volume (16 mm in diameter). It appears that radiation therapy could be useful and cost-effective, but neither the optimal time-dose schedule single or multiple dose fractions nor the type of radiation proton conformal beam or x-ray therapy are defined. METHODS: By means of an extensive literature survey, we reviewed the rationale for using radiation to treat subfoveal neovascularization, examined a paradigm of radiation interaction with tissue, reviewed the histopathology of neovascular membranes, and documented the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of the disease. Accepting that the eye is an extracranial brain extension, and that its microvasculature has properties similar to brain microvessels, we reviewed the radiobiologic response of brain microvessels. We also revisited the controversy concerning the efficacy of single-dose-fraction vs. multifraction schedules. RESULTS: This paper outlines parameters within which radiation therapy's role might be defined, and proposes a clinical radiation-biology scoring program to evaluate radiation effects, based on the SOMA concept. CONCLUSION: A prospective, controlled clinical trial is feasible and is indicated to determine radiation therapy's role in managing the proliferative component of age-related macular degeneration.

One day after the completion of therapy, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, headache, and postural hypotension. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a marked fall of the previously elevated urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) and undetectable plasma cortisols. The urinary 17-OHCS transiently returned to supranormal levels but over a 2 1/2-week period decreased and then remained low. The patient also demonstrated a subnormal urinary aldosterone excretion in relation to plasma renin activity (PRA) during 10 mEq/24 h sodium restriction. The remainder of the endocrine evaluation was normal, suggesting that pituitary function otherwise remained intact. One and one-half years after alpha-particle therapy, the patients's urinary 17-OHCS were normal and responded normally to metyrapone. The relationship between urinary aldosterone excretion and PRA also was normal. It is postulated that there was an infarction of an ACTH secreting pituitary tumor leaving the remainder of the pituitary intact. Achronically elevated circulating level of ACTH with sudden loss of ACTH secretion appeared to have been responsible for the initial low urinary aldosterone as well as the low urinary 17-OHCS. This is the first reported case of a presumed pituitary tumor infarction in association with alpha-particle pituitary radiation

We report the results in terms of local control, toxicity, and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with Grade 2/4 (n = 7) and Grade 3/4 (n = 13) gliomas according to the Daumas-Duport classification were treated on a prospective institutional protocol at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between 1993 and 1996. Doses prescribed to the target volumes were 68.2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE, 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE) to gross tumor in Grade 2 lesions and 79.7 CGE in Grade 3 lesions. Fractionation was conventional, with 1.8 to 1.92 CGE once per day. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, biopsy-proven Daumas-Duport Grade 2/4 or 3/4 malignant glioma, Karnofsky performance score of 70 or greater, and supratentorial tumor. Median age of the patient population at diagnosis was 35.9 years (range 19-49). Ten tumors were mixed gliomas, one an oligodendroglioma. RESULTS: Five patients underwent biopsy, 12 a subtotal resection, and 3 a gross total resection. Median interval from surgery to first radiation treatment was 2.9 months. Actuarial 5-year survival rate for Grade 2 lesions was 71% as calculated from diagnosis (median survival not yet reached); actuarial 5-year survival for Grade 3 lesions was 23% (median 29 months). Median follow-up is 61 months and 55 months for 4 patients alive with Grade 2 and 3 patients alive with Grade 3 lesions, respectively. Three patients with Grade 2 lesions died from tumor recurrence, whereas 2 of the 4 survivors have evidence of radiation necrosis. Eight of 10 patients who have died with Grade 3 lesions died from tumor recurrence, 1 from pulmonary embolus, and 1 most likely from radiation necrosis. One of 3 survivors in this group has evidence of radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Tumor recurrence was neither prevented nor noticeably delayed in our patients relative to published series on photon irradiation. Dose escalation using this fractionation scheme and total dose delivered failed to improve outcome for patients with Grade 2 and 3 gliomas

Actuarial 5-year survival rate for Grade 2 lesions was 71% as calculated from diagnosis (median survival not yet reached); actuarial 5-year survival for Grade 3 lesions was 23% (median 29 months). Median follow-up is 61 months and 55 months for 4 patients alive with Grade 2 and 3 patients alive with Grade 3 lesions, respectively. Three patients with Grade 2 lesions died from tumor recurrence, whereas 2 of the 4 survivors have evidence of radiation necrosis. Eight of 10 patients who have died with Grade 3 lesions died from tumor recurrence, 1 from pulmonary embolus, and 1 most likely from radiation necrosis. One of 3 survivors in this group has evidence of radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Tumor recurrence was neither prevented nor noticeably delayed in our patients relative to published series on photon irradiation. Dose escalation using this fractionation scheme and total dose delivered failed to improve outcome for patients with Grade 2 and 3 gliomas

We report the results in terms of local control, toxicity, and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with Grade 2/4 (n = 7) and Grade 3/4 (n = 13) gliomas according to the Daumas-Duport classification were treated on a prospective institutional protocol at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between 1993 and 1996. Doses prescribed to the target volumes were 68.2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE, 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE) to gross tumor in Grade 2 lesions and 79.7 CGE in Grade 3 lesions. Fractionation was conventional, with 1.8 to 1.92 CGE once per day. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, biopsy-proven Daumas-Duport Grade 2/4 or 3/4 malignant glioma, Karnofsky performance score of 70 or greater, and supratentorial tumor. Median age of the patient population at diagnosis was 35.9 years (range 19-49). Ten tumors were mixed gliomas, one an oligodendroglioma. RESULTS: Five patients underwent biopsy, 12 a subtotal resection, and 3 a gross total resection. Median interval from surgery to first radiation treatment was 2.9 months. Actuarial 5-year survival rate for Grade 2 lesions was 71% as calculated from diagnosis (median survival not yet reached); actuarial 5-year survival for Grade 3 lesions was 23% (median 29 months). Median follow-up is 61 months and 55 months for 4 patients alive with Grade 2 and 3 patients alive with Grade 3 lesions, respectively. Three patients with Grade 2 lesions died from tumor recurrence, whereas 2 of the 4 survivors have evidence of radiation necrosis. Eight of 10 patients who have died with Grade 3 lesions died from tumor recurrence, 1 from pulmonary embolus, and 1 most likely from radiation necrosis.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients irradiated with a Cobalt unit and twenty irradiated with 15 MeV photons in a linear accelerator were used for comparison of the dose delivered. Each irradiation was repeated eight times during four consecutive days up to a total dose of 12.6 Gy in the whole body (below 10 Gy in the lungs). Lateral fields were used in six fractions, and anterior-posterior fields in two fractions. An electron boost to the thorax wall was added. Doses were calculated and measured in-vivo in ten transverse sections. RESULTS: For the patient taken as an example doses in the middle of the lungs were 10.7 Gy for Co-60 and 11.2 Gy for 15 MeV photons without compensators and 9.6 Gy, 9.6 Gy respectively when compensators were applied. Mean doses in the lungs in the group were 9.5 Gy for Co-60 and 9.7 Gy for X 15 MeV, respectively. Duration of the treatment was shorter with the use of the 15 MeV than that with Co-60 by about 20%. Repositioning of the patient during two fractions with the use of X 15 MeV could be eliminated and therefore the patient's comfort increased

Cranial chordomas arise adjacent to critical neural tissues within the notochordal remnants in the clivus, frequently compromising adequate surgical removal of the primary tumor and making difficult the delivery of an adequate dose of radiotherapy. The optimal dose and fractionation have not been established. METHODS. The results of radiation combined with surgery, radiation alone, and surgery alone were compared based on the cases of 159 patients reported in the literature. An analysis of the optimal biologically equivalent doses (BED) was performed using the linear-quadratic formula on 47 patients. RESULTS. Past techniques using conventional photon irradiation have shown no dose-response relationship. Survival is improved for patients undergoing surgery followed by radiotherapy. CONCLUSION. Combined surgery and postoperative radiation is preferable to radiotherapy or surgery alone for management of cranial chordoma. Newer radiotherapeutic approaches will allow increased dose delivery to the target volume without an anticipated increase in radiation morbidity. It is believed that this will increase tumor control. Recent results of studies using charged particle therapy in cranial chordoma suggest that this may be an alternative way to optimize radiotherapy. [References: 49]

Our study focuses on a complex formed by the estrogen response element (ERE) DNA and the recombinant human estrogen receptor alpha (ER), which mediates the signalling of female sex hormones, estrogens. The method of native polyacrylamide retardation gel electrophoresis is used to study the stability of the complex under irradiation by low LET radiation ((60)Co gamma rays) and the ability of the separately irradiated partners to form complexes. The relative probabilities of ERE DNA strand breakage and base damages as well as the probabilities of damages to the ER binding domain are calculated using the Monte Carlo method-based model RADACK

RT consisted of 3600 to 4500 cGy external pelvic treatments on a 6-MeV linear accelerator followed by two intracavitary applications administering a total of 4000 mg hr of radium equivalent cesium. CT consisted of a course of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 iv bolus) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU; 1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the second week of external RT and another course of cis-platinum (CDDP; 75 mg/m2, 1-6 hr infusion) and 5FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the first intracavitary cesium application. Toxicity was acceptable and complete clinical response was obtained in all patients at the end of the regimen. Nine patients are alive (eight without disease) 6 to 37 months following initiation of treatment (median 20 months). One patient has developed lumbar spine bone metastases and another died of local and pulmonary disease at 28 months. This combination of 5FU/mitomycin C/CDDP and RT appears to be a practical, well-tolerated, and highly effective regimen for advanced cervical carcinoma

Although this therapeutic modality has been in use for a decade and although nearly 500 patients have been so treated, there are only two published reports of the pathologic examination of these eyes. Key features found on pathologic examination of our patient's enucleated eye included vascular alterations in the tumor's blood supply, lymphocytic infiltrates, and lipoidal degeneration of tumor cells. The interval from therapy to enucleation in our patient was much longer than in the several previously reported cases, a factor allowing for the development of a more cumulative radiation effect on the tumor. The extent and degree of radiation-induced necrosis in our patient's tumor were more profound than in previous reports

All of these patients had received alpha-particle radiation to their pituitary glands during the period when this form of therapy was given for diabetic retinopathy. Extraocular muscle palsy developed in 11 of these patients, iridoplegia in six, and fifth nerve damage in six. All of the palsies developed within a short period following their irradiation, and a definite dose relationship was present. The dose rate was approximately 100 rads/min for all cases. Fractionation varied but it is known for all cases. The estimated doses to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cranial nerves was calculated at a saggital plane 13 to 15 mm from the pituitary by using computer-drawn dosimetry charts for the respective aperture size. The energetic alpha particles were produced by the 184-in synchrocyclotron at Berkeley, Calif. A dose relationship for radiation palsies was apparent

This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

This study was to evaluate the influence of radiotherapy on the survival of stage IV NSCLC patients. METHODS: Clinical data of 287 patients with stage IV NSCLC were retrospectively analyzed. Whole brain was treated with two parallel fields irradiation; bone metastases were treated with one local field irradiation. Primary tumors, regional lymph nodes and other distant metastases were treated by conventional fractionation radiotherapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Whole brain and bone radiotherapy was delivered with a total dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks. The median dose for primary tumors and regional lymph nodes was 50 Gy (20-70 Gy), and the median dose for other distant metastases was 46 Gy (40-60 Gy). RESULTS: The median survival time of the 287 patients was 9 months (8-10 months). The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 30.2% and 8.9%. The median survival time was significantly longer in the patients received chemotherapy than in the patients didn't (10 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.049). In the patients with brain, bone, or other distant metastases, the median survival time was 8, 9, and 10 months, respectively; the 1-year survival rates were 24.8%, 28.7%, and 37.5%, respectively; the 2-year survival rates were 6.7%, 7%, and 15.3%, respectively. By unitivariate analysis, histological type and patients' age were prognostic factors of NSCLC. The median survival time was significantly longer in adenocarcinoma patients than in squamous cell carcinoma patients and other carcinoma patients (10 months vs. 7 and 9 months, P = 0.046), longer in the patients of < or =60 years old than in those of >60 years old (11 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.012), and longer in the patients with only bone metastases than in the patients with concomitant other distant metastases (10 months vs. 6 months, P = 0.033), but there was no significant difference between the patients with only brain metastases and those with concomitant other distant metastases (9 months vs. 8 months, P = 0.374). Radiotherapy for primary tumors and lymph nodes, complications of other chronic diseases, and irradiation dose and pattern had no effect on the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Histological type and patients' age may affect the efficacy of radiotherapy on stage IV NSCLC. The irradiation patterns of 40 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks or 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks have no effect on the survival of patients with brain or bone metastases

Assessment was made in a retrospective analysis, noting influence of age, stage of disease at presentation, initial histology, dose of radiotherapy given and any subsequent treatment required, recorded up to October 1986. From this it will be seen that the development of a six fraction regime, given over a period of three weeks leads to comparable results to other reported series, whether assessed as a local response or by survival curves, and to the economical use of scarce resources, but even more important, is less wearing for patients than daily fractionation, with early and late morbidity being within acceptable limits

Shielding of previously treated and uninvolved areas was achieved by encapsulating cerrobend within a thermoplastic shell in one patient. In the other patient, GE Saturnes unique asymmetric electron field definition facility was used. Satisfactory dose uniformity was demonstrated by the computation of dose distributions on the full summed electron pencil beam model on the Target Series 2 treatment planning system. Verification of the calculated dose homogeneity was confirmed with lithium fluoride (TLD-100) thermoluminescent dosimetry. The relatively simple treatment set-up was accomplished easily on a routine basis and was well tolerated by the patients, both of whom have been in complete remission since their treatment

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In head and neck cancer, including thyroid cancer, it is assessed that at least 300 patients annually will gain sufficiently from proton beam therapy, both to improve tumour control and to decrease toxicity to compensate for the increased treatment costs using protons.

The time-attenuation curves, time of appearance and recovery, and 3D size reduction pattern are described in patients of different ages and genders with different irradiation doses, irradiated portals, and Child groups. METHOD: Forty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 50 to 84 Gy proton beam irradiation in periods of 14-52 days. CT including noncontrast and dynamic study was performed every 3 months starting 3 weeks after the end of irradiation. The 3D volume measurement of areas of radiation-induced hepatic injury was performed through incremental dynamic CT images in every follow-up study. CT follow-up study of the patients was done for 12-76 months. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as low attenuation areas on noncontrast CT and enhanced areas on dynamic study in the regions corresponding to the irradiation portals. Of our cases, 67.5% showed the appearance of radiation hepatitis in 3-4 weeks and 95.3% in 3-4 months after the end of irradiation. In both periods, there was a significant delay in the female patients. The time-attenuation curve showed an early and prolonged enhancement of the irradiated regions. The volume reduction pattern of the injured areas was found to be longstanding, exponential, and directed from periphery to the center. CONCLUSION: Early appearance of radiation-induced hepatic injury was found only to be gender dependent, with a tendency to occur with higher irradiated doses; no other parameters affected this phenomenon in our cases. Disappearance of the injured areas, if present, takes a long time (at least 42 months)

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Grade 1 and 4 gliomas were excluded. Patients benefited from a 3D dose calculation based on high-definition CT and MRI, a stereotactic positioning using implanted fiducial markers and a thermoplastic mask. Mean tumor dose ranged between 63 and 67 Gy delivered in five weekly sessions of 1.8 Gy in most patients, according to the histological types (doses in Co Gy Equivalent, with a mean proton-RBE of 1.1). RESULTS: With a median 18-month follow-up (range: four-58 months), local control in tumors located in the envelopes and in the skull base was 97% (33/34), and in parenchymal tumors, 43% (6/14) only. Two patients (5%) presented with a clinically severe radiation-induced necrosis (temporal lobe and chiasm). CONCLUSION: In our experience, high-dose radiation combining photons and protons is a safe and highly efficient procedure in selected malignancies of the skull base and envelopes

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1991, 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (stages IIB-IVA) were treated with a curative intent by external photon irradiation to the pelvis, followed by proton irradiation to the primary tumor, delivering a median total tumor dose of 86 Gy (range 71 Gy/26 Fr-101 Gy/46 Fr), and were followed for a median period of 139 months (range 11-184 months). RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 89% and 40%, respectively.

In contrast, the proton beam has Bragg peak, which limits distribution of the beam. The aim of this study was to prove the usefulness of proton irradiation for HCC. METHODS: The proton irradiation was performed in 32 nodular lesions in 24 patients with HCC who had unresectable tumors or serious complications; the proton irradiation was performed either as monotherapy (15 lesions) or as combination therapy to insufficient Lipiodol-targeted chemotherapy (Kodama Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (17 lesions). The energy was 250 MeV, and 50-87 Gy (76.5 +/- 9.5, mean +/- SD) in total was irradiated for a time period of 17-69 days. RESULTS: After 1 year, size reduction was seen in 12 out of 13 lesions (92%) in the monotherapy group and 9 out of 9 lesions (100%) in the combination therapy group; after 2 years, size reduction was seen 4 out of 5 lesions (80%) in the monotherapy group and 5 out of 5 lesions (100%) in the combination therapy group. Local tumor control has being assured for 2 years of the observation, which is continuing for another 2 years. None of the patients have experienced any serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that proton irradiation is a new, safe, and effective therapeutic option in cases of HCC, even in patients with unresectable tumors or those with serious complications

We review our experience of acoustic tumor treatments at one institution using a gamma knife for SRS and the first commercial world installation of a dedicated linac for SRT. METHODS: Patients were treated with SRS on the gamma knife or SRT on the linac from October 1994 through August 2000. Gamma knife technique involved a fixed-frame multiple shot/high conformality single treatment, whereas linac technique involved daily conventional fraction treatments involving a relocatable frame, fewer isocenters, and high conformality established by noncoplanar arc beam shaping and differential beam weighting. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were treated on the gamma knife, and 56 patients were treated on the linac, with 1 NF-2 patient common to both units. Three patients were lost to follow-up, and in the remaining 122 patients, mean follow-up was 119 +/- 67 weeks for SRS patients and 115 +/- 96 weeks for SRT patients. Tumor control rates were high (> or =97%) for sporadic tumors in both groups but lower for NF-2 tumors in the SRT group. Cranial nerve morbidities were comparably low in both groups, with the exception of functional hearing preservation, which was 2.5-fold higher in patients who received conventional fraction SRT. CONCLUSION: SRS and SRT represent comparable noninvasive treatments for acoustic schwannomas in both sporadic and NF-2 patient groups. At 1-year follow-up, a significantly higher rate of serviceable hearing preservation was achieved in SRT sporadic tumor patients and may therefore be preferable to alternatives including surgery, SRS, or possibly observation in patients with serviceable hearing

One such method is to use positron emission tomography (PET), which takes advantage of the nuclear reactions that take place between protons and nuclei in the tissue. The dominant nuclear reaction in human muscle tissue involves oxygen nuclei and produces radioactive oxygen-15. Oxygen-15 decays through positron emission, and it is these positrons that go on to annihilate that produce the signal used in the PET technique. Finding the distribution of annihilation points, however, is not analogous to finding the proton dose distribution. The oxygen-15 and positrons travel finite distances within the tissue, blurring the detected PET distribution from the desired proton distribution. Through Monte Carlo modelling, an analysis of the differences between the positron, oxygen-15 and proton distributions has been made. The program SRIM 2003 was used to find the correlation between the three distributions within simulated muscle tissue. Results show that the distal edge of the proton Bragg peak correlates with the detectable positron distribution, which is a section of the dose distribution of interest due to the steep dose gradient and position of adjacent critical structures

Local tumor control and long-term palliation for both primary and metastatic tumors may be achieved with IMRT while reducing the risk of spinal cord toxicity associated with conventional radiotherapy techniques. In this article, we report our initial clinical experience in treating 16 paraspinal tumors with IMRT in which the planning target volume was 2 mm or greater from the spinal cord. METHODS: IMRT was administered by using a linear accelerator mounted with a multileaf collimator. Two immobilization body frames developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were used for patients with and without spinal implants. During a 30-month period, 16 patients underwent IMRT for metastatic and primary tumors. Eleven patients were treated for symptomatic recurrences after undergoing surgery and prior external beam radiotherapy, and one patient was treated after undergoing radiotherapy for a metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma with overlapping ports to the spine. Four patients with primary tumors were treated after primary resection that resulted in positive histological margins. Twelve patients were symptomatic with pain, functional radiculopathy, or both. Tumoral doses were determined on the basis of the relative radiosensitivity of tumors. Patients with metastatic tumors were administered a median tumoral dose of 20 Gy in four to five fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 6.0 Gy in addition to the full tolerance dose administered in previous radiation treatments. The primary tumors were delivered a median dose of 70 Gy in 33 to 37 fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 16 Gy. The median tumoral volume was 7.8 cm(3). RESULTS: Of the 15 patients who underwent radiographic follow-up, 13 demonstrated either no interval growth or a reduction in tumor size in a median follow-up period of 12 months (range, 2-23 mo). Two patients, one with a thoracic chondrosarcoma and one with a chordoma, showed tumor progression 1 year after undergoing IMRT. Pain symptoms improved in 11 of 11 patients, and 4 of 4 patients had significant improvement in their functionally significant radiculopathy and/or plexopathy. Pain relief was durable in all patients except the two with tumor progression. No patient showed signs or symptoms of radiation-induced myelopathy, radiculopathy, or plexopathy, including 12 patients with a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSION: IMRT was effective for treating pain and improving functional radiculopathy in patients with metastatic and primary tumors. Although long-term tumor control is not established in this study, high-dose tumoral irradiation can be performed without causing radiation myelopathy in more than 1 year of follow-up

Distortion of the measured PCr/ATP ratios due to differences in the nOe may require accurate correction to realize the full benefit of the effect in studies involving quantitative intergroup comparisons

To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic techniques of carbon ion therapy have been established for patients with prostate cancer. Carbon ion therapy may exert excellent effect to the tissues of prostate cancer.

To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two optical displacement sensors, placed close to the patient's head, were used for online monitoring of the head position, with submillimeter accuracy. Motion data, including the difference between start and end position (Dx) and the maximum displacement during the recorded session (Dx-max), were acquired for pretreatment sessions to analyze alignment radiographs, and for treatment sessions. We have recorded 102 pretreatment and 99 treatment sessions in 16 patients immobilized with a thermoplastic mask, and 44 pretreatment and 56 treatment sessions in 13 patients immobilized with vacuum-assisted dental fixation. To avoid incorrect data analysis due to replicate observations, only 1 pretreatment and 1 treatment session per patient were selected at random for statistical comparison of mean or median motion parameters in different subgroups. RESULTS: Both techniques showed similar immobilization efficiencies. The median Dx and Dx-max values were 0. 18 mm and 0.46 mm, respectively, for 16 treatment sessions with mask immobilization, and 0.22 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively, for 13 treatment sessions with dental immobilization. Motion parameters for pretreatment and treatment sessions were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Online verification of patient's head motion is feasible and provides valuable data for confirmation of proper treatment delivery in individual patients, as well as for the evaluation of different immobilization methods

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

[German]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Brain/bs [Blood Supply], Child, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy, Risk, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time	Arterio-venous malformations of the brain are accompanied by a risk of hemorrhages which increases in the course of time. Thus a therapy is indicated as soon as the arterio-venous malformation is discovered. If surgical treatment is contra-indicated, radiotherapy can be applied with a high rate of success (obliteration of the arterio-venous malformation after two years in up to 88% of cases). Percutaneous radiotherapy has to be performed with a stereotaxic technique under controlled conditions. The stipulations for this treatment are described on the basis of our own method. Between August 1982 and July 1983, twenty patients have been treated without any complications due to therapy or to the disease. This form of radiotherapy using the bremsstrahlung of a linear accelerator can be considered as an alternative method with respect to proton irradiation

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHODS: A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514). CONCLUSION: Dose boost in skull base can reduce the recurrence of stage T4 NPC in skull base and tends to enhance the disease-freely survival rate for NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvementu it is recommended to such patients

The authors present their preliminary results on 66 patients with nonsurgical intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The doses delivered for treatment varied from 20 to 70 Gy. Doses of no more than 40 Gy were used in 80% of patients. An angiographic study was performed when the computed tomographic scan controls showed relevant modifications of the lesion volume. Total obliteration was obtained in 27 of the 41 patients (65.8%) who were followed up for at least 24 months. The percentage of the cured patients is significantly higher when a) the entire malformation is included in the 75% isodose (96%) and b) the maximum diameter of the lesion is less than 12 mm (81%).

Gross total resection with negative margins is rarely achieved, and the risks of functional, structural, and cosmetic deficits limit the radiation dose using conventional radiation techniques. Twenty-nine children and adolescents treated with conformal proton radiotherapy (proton RT) were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome

Twenty eight patients underwent IORT after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer by means of a dedicated mobile accelerator, Novac7 (by Hitesys, SpA, Italy). A 9 MeV electron beam at high dose per pulse was used. Eighteen patients received IORT at escalating doses of 16, 18, and 20 Gy at 85% isodose, six patients for each dose level. Further, ten patients received 20 Gy at 85% isodose. The electron applicator position was checked in all cases by means of two orthogonal images obtained with brilliance intensifier. Target and organ at risk doses were measured in vivo by a MOSFETs dosimetry system. MOSFETs and microMOSFET dosimeters were inserted into sterile catheters and directly positioned into the rectal lumen, for ten patients, and into the bladder to urethra anastomosis, in the last 14 cases. Verification at 0 degree led to very few adjustments of setup while verifications at 90 degrees often suggested to bring the applicator closer to the target. In vivo dosimetry showed an absorbed dose into the rectum wall < or =1% of the total dose. The average dose value inside the anastomosis, for the 12 patients analyzed, was 23.7 Gy with a standard deviation of +/-7.6%, when the prescription was 20 Gy at 85% isodose. Using a C-arm mobile image intensifier, it is possible to assess if the positioning is correct and safe. Radio-opaque clips and liquid were necessary to obtain good visible images. In vivo MOSFETs dosimetry is feasible and reliable. A satisfactory agreement between measured and expected doses was found

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large clinical series of patients with intraocular melanoma to determine if light irises are associated with increased risk of death from these tumors. METHODS: A total of 1162 patients treated with proton irradiation between 1984 and 1996 were observed through 1997. RESULTS: Iris color in the patients was blue or gray in 48%, green or hazel in 30%, and brown in 23%. Tumors in patients with blue or gray irises were less heavily pigmented (P<.001) and closer to the optic disc and macula (P<.001). Five- and 10-year metastasis-related death rates were 0.14 and 0.21, respectively, for those with blue or gray irises and 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, for those with darker irises (P = .02). In a Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for tumor characteristics, patients with blue or gray irises died of metastatic disease at a rate 1.90 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.85) that of patients with brown irises. The rate of metastatic death was not significantly elevated for those with green or hazel irises (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.23). CONCLUSION: Patients with blue or gray irises appear to be at increased risk of metastatic death from choroidal melanoma, independent of other risk factors

Our method uses a modified Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRS), CT-guided, stereotactic system and a 6 MV linear accelerator equipped with a special collimator (diameters of 12.5 mm to 30.0 mm projected to isocenter) located 23 cm from isocenter. Target localization via planar angiography has been added. Treatment consists of a series of arcing beams using both gantry and couch rotations. During treatment, the patient's head is immobilized independently of the radiotherapy couch and is precisely positioned without reference to room lasers or light field. A precise verification of alignment precedes each treatment. Extensive performance tests have shown that a target, localized by CT, can be irradiated with a positional accuracy of 2.4 mm in any direction with 95% confidence. If angiography is used for localization, the results are better. The dose 1.0 cm outside the target volume is less than 20% of the prescribed dose for a medium sized collimator

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1975 and October 1993, 204 patients were treated for chordoma of the base of skull or cervical spine, of which 63 have developed relapse. These 63 patients constitute the main focus of this study. Forty-five patients presented with base of skull and 18 with cervical spine tumors. All patients received combined proton and photon beam radiation. The median prescribed dose was 70.1 cobalt-Gray equivalent (CGE) (range 66.6-77.4). There were 25 males and 38 females, with a median age of 41 years (range 7-66). Median follow-up was 54 months (range 8-158). RESULTS: Sixty-three of the 204 patients treated (31%) had treatment failure. Among the 63 patients who relapsed, 60 (95%) experienced local recurrence, and in 49 patients (78%), this was the only site of failure. Two of 63 patients (3%) developed regional lymph node relapse and 3 of 63 (5%) developed surgical pathway recurrence (1 left neck, 1 palate and 1 nasal cavity). Thirteen of 204 patients relapsed in distant sites, accounting for 20% (13 of 63) of all patients with recurrence in this series. The most common metastatic sites were lungs and bones presenting in 7 of 13 and 6 of 13 patients, respectively. Only 2 of 13 patients failed with isolated distant metastasis. The actuarial 3- and 5-year survival rates after local relapse (60 patients) were 44 and 5%, respectively. Following distant failure (13 patients), the 3- and 5-year survival rates were 25 and 12%, respectively. After any relapse (63 patients) the corresponding survival rates were 43 and 7%. Following local relapse, 49 of 60 patients underwent salvage therapy consisting of subtotal resection in most patients (46 of 49). The remaining 11 of 60 patients received supportive care only. Salvage therapy resulted in stable or improved status without subsequent disease progression in 26 of 49 (53%), and progressive disease in 16 of 49 patients (33%). The actuarial 2- and 5-year overall survival rates following relapse for the 49 patients who underwent salvage treatment were 63 and 6%, which favorably compared to the 2-year survival rate of 21% for those who received supportive care only (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Local relapse is the predominant type of treatment failure for chordomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Salvage treatment may relieve symptoms; however, most patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Poor long-term survival rates following relapse emphasize the importance of a combined treatment approach with experienced surgeons and radiation oncologists at the time of primary treatment. For most patients, only permanent local tumor control will offer a chance of cure

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

A study was undertaken to determine the frequency and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT in patients who had undergone conformal proton (to a limited volume) radiation therapy. We compared these findings with those from a group of patients who had undergone a combination of photon and conformal proton (to a larger volume) radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Proton radiation therapy was associated with a lower frequency of pulmonary injury than the combined regimen. Injury correlated well with the volume of normal lung that was irradiated. Conformal proton radiation therapy appears to be able to reduce the incidence and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT

Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality

1	76	Radioimmunotherapy with alpha-emitting nuclides. [Review] [68 refs]	Alpha Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Animals, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Radioimmunotherapy, Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage	This review discusses the application of alpha particle-emitting radionuclides in targeted radioimmunotherapy. It will outline the production and chemistry of astatine-211, bismuth-212, lead-212, actinium-225, bismuth-213, fermium-255, radium-223 and terbium-149, which at present are the most promising alpha-emitting isotopes available for human clinical use. The selective cytotoxicity offered by alpha particle-emitting radioimmunoconstructs is due to the high linear energy transfer and short particle path length of these radionuclides. Based upon the pharmacokinetics of alpha particle-emitting radioimmunoconstructs, both stochastic and conventional dosimetric methodology is discussed, as is the preclinical and initial clinical use of these radionuclides conjugated to monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of human neoplasia.

These methods may become cumbersome and time-consuming if high time resolution is required or if the geometry is complex. Furthermore, it is difficult to study double-dynamic systems, e.g., to investigate the influence of time-dependent beam delivery (i.e., magnetically moving beam spots in proton beam scanning) on the dose deposition in a moving target. We recently introduced the technique of 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation to model continuously changing geometries. In intensity modulated proton therapy, dose is delivered by individual pristine Bragg curves. Dose spots are positioned in the patient by varying magnetic field and beam energy. If the movement of these dose spots occurs during significant respiratory motion, interplay effects can take place. Because of the inhomogeneity of individual subfields, the consequences of motion can be more severe than in conventional proton therapy. We demonstrate how the technique of 4D Monte Carlo can be used to study interplay effects in proton beam scanning. Time-dependent beam delivery to a changing patient geometry is simulated in a single 4D dose calculation. Interplay effects between respiratory motion and beam scanning speed are demonstrated

Both radical surgical removal and high-dose radiation therapy, particularly proton beam therapy, reportedly are effective in tumor control and improve survival rates. The authors posit that these tumors are best treated with radical surgery and proton-photon beam therapy. During the last 5 years, they treated 25 patients (15 females and 10 males) who harbored pathologically diagnosed skull base chordomas. The mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range 8-61 years). Previous surgery or radiation therapy was performed at other institutions in seven and two patients, respectively. The authors performed 33 surgical procedures on 23 patients. Radical removal (defined as absence of residual tumor on operative inspection and postoperative imaging) was achieved in 10 patients; subtotal resection (defined as resection of > 90% of the tumor) was achieved in 11 patients; and partial resection (defined as resection of < 90% of the tumor) was achieved in two patients. Radical surgical removal included not only the excision of soft-tumor tissue, but also extensive drilling of the adjacent bone. Adjuvant therapy consisted of postoperative combined proton-photon beam therapy (given to 17 patients and planned for one patient) and conventional radiation therapy (two patients); three patients received no adjunct therapy. To date, four patients have died. One patient who had undergone previous surgery and sacrifice of the internal carotid artery died postoperatively from a massive stroke; one patient died from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without evidence of recurrence; and two patients died at 25 and 39 months of recurrent tumor. Permanent neurological complications included third cranial nerve palsy (one patient) and hemianopsia (one patient); radiation necrosis occurred in three patients. Of the 21 patients followed for more than 3 months after surgery, 16 have had no evidence of recurrence and five (including the two mortalities noted above) have had recurrent tumors (four diagnosed clinically and one radiologically). The mean disease-free interval was 14.4 months. A longer follow-up period will, hopefully, support the early indication that radical surgical removal and postoperative proton-photon beam therapy is an efficacious treatment. The use of skull base approaches based on the tumor classification introduced in this paper is associated with low mortality and morbidity rates

DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized interventional case series. METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent TTT for small uveal melanomas located in the posterior pole of the eyes. Tumors were between 2.5 and 4 mm in thickness. TTT was performed with a diode laser at 810 nm. Patients had between one and three TTT sessions, with an intensity adapted to the coloration of the fundus impact. Biomicroscopic examination, ultrasonographic measurements, and angiography were performed before and two months, four months, and six months after treatment, then regularly during follow-up. RESULTS: Eight of the 18 tumors regressed and 10 recurred. The one- and two-year metastasis-free survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method were, respectively, 61.11% to 44.44% (95% confidence interval). Recurrences were managed with enucleation (three patients), proton beam therapy (six), or additional thermotherapy (one). After treatment, visual acuity was maintained or improved for the eight patients with nonrecurrent tumors. Pathologic analysis of the three enucleated eyes revealed scleral invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite encouraging initial short-term results obtained with TTT for the management of small choroidal melanomas, the occurrence of severe complications, especially recurrences and insufficient local tumor control, should raise concern about indications for primary TTT given as isolated treatment for small melanomas of the posterior pole

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 181 patients having rectum tumour were irradiated preoperatively with 36 or 40 Gy between 1990 and 2001. The classification was made according to the modified Astler-Coller pathological staging system. The radiation treatment was carried out with telecobalt unit or high energy photon of linear accelerator after computerized radiation treatment planning. RESULTS: The most important characterizing factor for the efficiency of the preoperative irradiation is the local recurrence rate that was found to be 21.56% in our investigation. The survival rate was significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the applied dose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 181 patients having rectum tumour were irradiated preoperatively with 36 or 40 Gy between 1990 and 2001. The classification was made according to the modified Astler-Coller pathological staging system. The radiation treatment was carried out with telecobalt unit or high energy photon of linear accelerator after computerized radiation treatment planning. RESULTS: The most important characterizing factor for the efficiency of the preoperative irradiation is the local recurrence rate that was found to be 21.56% in our investigation. The survival rate was significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the applied dose. CONCLUSION: Our statistical analysis was applied to investigate the efficiency of the only preoperatively irradiated patients. The results are in agreement with the reported contributions

Total body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The irradiation technique with 4 MV X-rays is described. The patients are treated without lung-shieldings. The dose-measurements show an acceptable homogeneity. The applied technique is very easy in comparison with other centers. A main point is making the patient's position as comfortable as possible. The accuracy of dose-application and dose-distribution is considered clinically acceptable

Percutaneous high-voltage therapy with cobalt 60 was given to 51 patients and 35 patients were exposed to ultra-hard X-rays from al 17 MeV betatron. Taking into account tumour staging and grading, there was no difference between the two groups as far as prevention of tumour recurrence is concerned. Tumour recurrences occurred in 63-65 percent of the cases. Following betatron irradiation, there was an average five-year survival rate of 54 percent, following telecobalt irradiation, the figure was 41 percent

The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

Over the last 10 months, we've evaluated its contribution to the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by means of accelerated proton beam irradiation. MATERIAL: Using UBM, we have examined 55 cases of uveal melanoma's, whose anterior border was situated at 6 mm or less from the limbus and that were consequently treated by proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The presumed tumoral origin was the ciliary body's pars plicata in 13 cases and the pars plana or the choroid in 42 cases, 17 of which presented a tumoral invasion of the pars plicata. A pars plana detachment anterior to or surrounding the anterior tumoral border, was present in 22 cases. The height of the tumor could only be measured by UBM if it was less than 2.5 mm. Information gathered using UBM have contributed to an improvement of the therapy plan in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Because of the strong attenuation of the high frequency ultrasound signal, UBM can only be used for the examination of intra-ocular structures situated in direct neighbourhood to the global wall. Despite this technical limitation, ist contribution to the planning of the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by proton beam irradiation has appeared to be considerable

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

Total radiation doses delivered were 50 Gy for the postoperative group and 50 to 66 Gy for the group receiving only radiation using a 60Co single portal with or without wedged paired or single electron portal boost. Actuarial five-year survivals after radiation therapy were 55% for the postoperative group and 26% for radiation only group (p = 0.0004). The local control rates for the postoperative group were 83% for adenocarcinoma, 81% for adenoid cystic carcinoma, 83% for mucoepidermoid carcinoma and 62% for squamous cell carcinoma. Corresponding figures for the radiation only group were 40% for adenocarcinoma, 38% for adenoid cystic carcinoma and 33% for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conventional irradiation techniques continue to play an important role because they offer superior local control for postoperative patients with carcinoma of the major salivary glands. However, the local control rates for the radiation only group were only 30 to 40%, so that new irradiation modalities such as provided by a high LET machine are needed for these patients

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma.

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy	
1	3235	31-P MR spectroscopy and MRI of a testicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma recurrence to monitor response to irradiation. A case report	Aged, Humans, Lymphoma, Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/di [Diagnosis], Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/pa [Pathology], Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Testicular Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Testicular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Testicular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Testis, Testis/pa [Pathology]	PURPOSE: To monitor the metabolic changes during the radiation treatment of a recurrence of a high malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the left testis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 76-year old patients who presented a diffuse centroblastic high malignant NHL recurrence in the left scrotal sac was examined with 31-P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before, during and after megavoltage radiotherapy to a total dose of 56 Gy. RESULTS: The 31-P MRS spectrum of the tumor showed before starting irradiation, intensive phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals that overlapped the inorganic phosphate (Pi) signal. After 26 Gy irradiation, the Pi peak appeared and revealed an intratumoral pH of 7.08 very close to that in the normal testis (pH of 7.02). After 56 Gy the tumor disappeared and a complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. 31-P MRS is sensitive to the changes in the tumor metabolic activity after irradiation with a dose of 26 Gy. 2. Pi and PME peaks could be good pathological markers in the steady-state response to irradiation. 3. MRI could confirm the radiation induced tumor regression and the achieved clinical complete remission

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

0	339	Patient study of in vivo verification of beam delivery and range, using positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging after proton therapy	Algorithms, Feasibility Studies, Humans, Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Massachusetts, Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Positron-Emission Tomography/mt [Methods], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Subtraction Technique, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and value of positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) for treatment verification after proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. RESULTS: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

[Review] [12 refs]	Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Stem, Cyclotrons, Europe, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], France, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neck, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Skull, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, X-Rays	Proton therapy offers potentially considerable advantages in the management of slow-growing, poorly resectable or non-resectable tumors resistant to x-rays and located close to critical radiosensitive anatomical structures, such as the brain stem of the spinal cord. Among over 13,000 irradiated patients in the USA, Europe, and Japan, two major clinical indications have been documented: 1. The conservative management of choroidal melanomas, in which 98% 5-year local control can be expected at the price of low toxicity and visual preservation in approximately half of them. 2. The curative management of low-grade chondrosarcomas and chordomas of the base of the skull and cervical spine, leading to, in combination with maximal tumor resection, 84%-94% long-term survival. Other ongoing studies concern prostate, head and neck carcinomas as well as various intracranial tumors. Radiosurgical programs are being conducted generally with single fractions and under stereotactic conditions. [References: 12]	
1	1454	Potential reduction of the incidence of radiation-induced second cancers by using proton beams in the treatment of pediatric tumors	Adolescent, Child, Humans, Incidence, Male, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/pc [Prevention & Control], Neoplasms,Second Primary/pc [Prevention & Control], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Switzerland, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To assess the potential influence of improved dose distribution with proton beams compared to conventional or intensity-modulated (IM) X-ray beams on the incidence of treatment-induced secondary cancers in pediatric oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

Fourteen patients were treated with surgery alone: eight patients with primary tumors in the sacrococcygeal region were treated with radical surgery and four are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) with follow-up of 8 to 20 years. Recurrent tumors in six patients were treated with surgery alone resulting in long palliation (3-25 years). The actuarial survival rate at 5 years for all patients treated with surgery was 76%. Radiation therapy was used in patients after either a biopsy (15), partial excision (17), or before radical excision in 2 patients. To achieve a worthwhile level of palliation, doses greater than 4000 cGy were required. High-dose levels (greater than 6500 cGy) were achieved in nine cases by a combination of photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The results to date of this approach for lesions of the base of skull and cervical vertebral body are encouraging: high local control and low morbidity. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of all patients treated with radiation was 50%

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1994 and 2002, 51 patients with intracranial meningiomas of the base of the skull were treated with a combination of photon and proton RT. Median total dose was 60.6 cobalt Gy equivalent (54-64). One hundred eight eye-related symptoms were collected; 80 other symptoms were noted and followed up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 25.4 months. Acute tolerance was excellent. Out of the 108 eye-related symptoms, 106 (96%) were evaluated. Improvements were reported for 73 (68.8%) of them. Out of the 88 other miscellaneous symptoms, 81 (92%) were evaluated. Improvements were reported in 54 cases (67%). Median time to improvement ranged from 1 to 24 months after completion of the radiotherapy, depending on the symptom. We did not observe any worsening of primary clinical signs. Radiologically, 1 patient relapsed 4 months after the end of irradiation. Pathology revealed a malignant (Grade 3) transformation of the initial Grade 1 meningioma. Four-year local control and overall survival rates were, respectively, 98% and 100%. Stabilization of the tumor was observed in 38 cases (72%), volume reduction in 10 cases (20%), and intratumor necrosis in 3 cases. Two patients complained of Grade 3 side effects: 1 unilateral hearing loss requiring aid and 1 case of complete pituitary deficiency. CONCLUSION: These results stressed the clinical efficacy of fractionated-associated photon-proton RT in the treatment of meningiomas, especially on cranial nerve palsies, without severe toxicity in almost all patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and August 1998 we treated 35 patients with stage cT1-3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. Thirty-two patients with a follow-up of 12 to 28 months (median: 18 months) were evaluated. After ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of 4 non-parallel needles, CT based 3D brachytherapy treatment planning ("Offenbach system") was performed. All patients received 4 fractions brachytherapy using a fractional dose of 5 or 7 Gy. Time between each fraction was 14 days. After brachytherapy 3D external irradiation followed up to 39.6 or 45.0 Gy. All patients received androgen deprivation, starting 2 to 19 months before brachytherapy, ending 3 months after 3D external radiotherapy. RESULTS: Posttreatment PSA levels dropped to < 1.5 ng/ml in 29/32 patients (91%). In 25 patients PSA levels were < 0.5 ng/ml, in 4 patients 0.5 to 1.5 ng/ml. In 2 patients we noted biochemical relapse. Transrectal implantation was very well tolerated. Grade 3 acute urinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient. We noted no Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient developed a Grade 3 late urinary toxicity. No patient showed late gastrointestinal side effects. All 140 dose-volume histograms for 3D HDR brachytherapy were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The new 3D HDR brachytherapy technique, combined with 3D external irradiation and androgen deprivation, is a feasible, so far well-tolerated and effective treatment in the short-time follow-up of median 18 months

1	2023	Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy and single high-dose radiosurgery for acoustic neuroma: early results of a prospective clinical study	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cranial Nerve Neoplasms/co [Complications], Cranial Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cranial Nerve Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Dose Fractionation, Female, Hearing, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Netherlands, Neuroma,Acoustic/co [Complications], Neuroma,Acoustic/rt [Radiotherapy], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Prospective Studies, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Universities, Vestibulocochlear Nerve Diseases/co [Complications], Vestibulocochlear Nerve Diseases/rt [Radiotherapy], Vestibulocochlear Nerve Diseases/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the local control and toxicity rate in acoustic neuroma patients treated with linear accelerator-based radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 37 consecutive patients treated with stereotactic radiation therapy for acoustic neuroma. All patients had progressive tumors, progressive symptoms, or both. Mean tumor diameter was 2.3 cm (range 0.8-3.3) on magnetic resonance (MR) scan. Dentate patients were given a dose of 5x4 Gy or 5x5 Gy and edentate patients were given a dose of 1x10 Gy or 1x12.50 Gy prescribed to the 80% isodose. All patients were treated with a single isocenter. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up period of 25 months (range 12-61), the actuarial local control rate at 5 years was 91% (only 1 patient failed). The actuarial rate of hearing preservation at 5 years was 66% in previously-hearing patients. The actuarial rate of freedom from trigeminal nerve toxicity was 97% at 5 years. No patient developed facial nerve toxicity or other complications. CONCLUSION: In this unselected series, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy and linear accelerator-based radiosurgery give excellent local control in acoustic neuroma. It combines a high rate of preservation of hearing with a very low rate of other toxicity, although follow-up is relatively short

The treatment is delivered using a carefully calibrated 10 MV machine and the Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW) system. The precision of the method as well as its quality assurance is described. Eight patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) received irradiation from August 1990 to November 1991. The prescribed dose at the periphery of the AVM was 8 Gy per session, with six patients receiving two sessions and two patients receiving one session. The field size, encompassing the 90% isodose, ranged from 20 mm to 35 mm. In four patients, follow-up angiography was performed one year after the full course of therapy; total obliteration of the AVM was noted in three (75%) with a partial response in the other. In the other four patients, follow-up angiography was not performed; one patient, who had only one session of irradiation, experienced rebleeding six months later and died, and the other three patients had no further episodes of bleeding during their follow-up of 28, 18 and 14 months, respectively. Linear accelerator-based stereotactic focal radiotherapy can attain a precisely defined and reproducible dose distribution. The effects of this treatment may take one to two years to develop. Our preliminary study suggests that it is an effective alternative treatment for surgically inaccessible lesions. Patients with a small cavernous sinus dural AVM appear to have a better and more rapid response. [References: 18]

[Japanese]	Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy	In general, the control rate with radiotherapy in early laryngeal cancer is close to 90%, probably the highest control rate that can be expected with this therapy. In other words, about 10% of patients still fail to respond to the therapy. This probably means nothing but the fact that the sigmoid response curve has reached the plateau. This ratio has remained unchanged, while physical and biological dose distribution has remarkably been improved these three decades. In this study, therefore, we discussed the cause of radioresistance in squamous metaplasia of laryngeal epithelium as the origin of laryngeal cancer

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases.

These tumors are believed to behave more aggressively than chordomas in adults and may have unusual morphology. This study examines a large series of pediatric skull base chordomas treated with a standardized protocol to characterize the behavior and morphology of these tumors. There were 31 males and 42 females ranging from 1 to 18 (mean 9.7) years. Forty-two cases (58%) were conventional chordomas, some of which had unusual histopathologic features. Chondroid chordomas comprised 23% of cases. Fourteen tumors (19%) were highly cellular and had a solid growth pattern with no myxoid matrix or lobular architecture. Eight of these had cytologic features of conventional chordoma cells including physaliferous cells (cellular chordoma). The remaining cellular tumors were composed of poorly differentiated epithelioid cells set in a fibrous stroma and lacked physaliferous cells (poorly differentiated chordoma). All variants studied by immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein, and vimentin. Mitoses and necrosis were seen in all variants. Follow-up data were available for all patients and ranged from 1 to 21 (mean 7.25) years. The survival rate was 81%. All but 1 patient with poorly differentiated chordoma died of disease. Overall, base of skull chordomas in children and adolescents treated with proton beam radiation have better survival than chordomas in adults. However, poorly differentiated chordomas are highly aggressive tumors

It is characterized by high signal on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Radiation-induced endothelial cell damage resulting in blood-nerve barrier breakdown is hypothesized to produce this pattern, but histologic evidence of this in the optic nerve is lacking. We attempted to evaluate the effect of radiation on endothelial cells in the optic nerve. DESIGN: Case-controlled histologic study. METHODS: We studied the optic nerves of 16 enucleated eyes from patients with uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation, 6 from normal eyes and 5 from eyes with unirradiated uveal melanomas. Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) lectin was used to identify endothelial cells in single paraffin sections. Transverse and longitudinal sections of vessels were counted in masked fashion. RESULTS: There were 49.4+/-6.9 transversely sectioned endothelial cells per millimeter of nerve in 6 optic nerves exposed to 0 to 1000 cGyE ("low-dose") compared with 17.3+/-5.3 in 10 nerves exposed to 5500 to 7000 cGyE ("high-dose") (P = 0.002). Longitudinally sectioned vessels stained with UEA-I were separately identified, with 11.5+/-2.1 in the low-dose group and 5.6+/-1.6 in the high-dose group (P = 0.044). The thickness and staining of the endothelial cell layer appeared greater in the high-dose group. Endothelial cell counts did not correlate with age, gender, acuity, or interval after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased radiation dosage to the optic nerve correlates with smaller numbers of endothelial cells

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Amifostine was given as daily intravenous application (500 mg) 10 to 15 minutes prior to radiotherapy in 20 patients. The results were compared with another collective of patients which was similar. RESULTS: According to the WHO score mucositis became manifest in 10 patients (Grade I) and 4 patients (Grade II) in the amifostine group vs 9 patients (Grade II), 6 patients (Grade III) and 1 patient (Grade IV) in the control group. Xerostomia has been seen in 15 patients (Grade I) and 5 patients (Grade II) after administration of amifostine. Without the drug 2 patients suffered from xerostomia (Grade I), 8 patients (Grade II) and 8 patients (Grade III), respectively. Administering amifostine had been feasible and non problematic. Only a small rate of toxic side effects like nausea (11%) or emesis (4%) was documented.

The fourteen patients had chordomas or low grade chondrosarcomas and were all treated by the same techniques. The median tumor dose was 69.7 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a range from 66.6 to 74.4 CGE. (CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co). The daily fraction size was 1.8-2.1 CGE. The median follow-up time is 48 months, ranging from 30 to 68 months. All treatments were planned using a computerized multi-dimensional system with the position of the pituitary outlined on the planning CT scan. Review of the dose distribution indicated that the dose to the pituitary ranged from 60.5 to 72.3 CGE, with a median of 67.6 CGE. One female patient had decreased thyroid and gonadotropin function at the time of diagnosis and has been on hormone replacement since that time. The other three females were all pre-menopausal at the time of radiotherapy. At this time four patients (3 males and 1 female) have developed endocrine abnormalities 14 to 45 months after irradiation. All four had evidence of hypothyroidism and two have also developed corticotropin deficiency. The three males had decreased testosterone levels; the female patient developed amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia. All four are asymptomatic with ongoing hormone replacement

In this survey, all the patient series treated worldwide were reviewed. They show an overall control rate of 31% with photon vs 64% with neutron therapy. A prospective randomised trial sponsored by the RTOG and the MRC published in 1988 and reviewed in 1993 showed an overall locoregional complete tumor clearance of 67% for neutrons and 17% for photons (P < 0.005), with 68% and 25% survival at two years for neutrons and photons respectively. This study was closed for ethical reasons. In Orleans, since 1987, 59 patients have been treated. At five years the persistent local control probability was 69.5%, the five-year crude survival probability 66% and the five-year tumor free survival probability was 64.5%. This review provides evidence that surgical treatment for salivary gland tumors should be limited to patients presenting a high likelihood of negative surgical margin and a small risk of facial nerve damage. Others patients should receive neutron radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment. [References: 61]

The treatment technique consists of several moving field irradiations in noncoplanar planes at a linear accelerator facility. Using collimated narrow beams, a high concentration of dose within small volumes with a dose gradient of 10-15%/mm was obtained. The dose calculation was based on geometrical information of multiplanar CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system, which is usable at CT, MR, and positron emission tomography (PET) installations. Special computer programs for correction of the geometrical MR distortions allowed a precise correlation of the different imaging modalities. The therapist can use combinations of CT, MR, and PET data for defining target volume. For instance, the superior soft tissue contrast of MR coupled with the metabolic features of PET may be a useful addition in the radiation treatment planning process. Furthermore, other features such as calculated dose distribution to critical structures can also be transferred from one set of imaging data to another and can be displayed as three-dimensional shaded structures

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 2001, AFR was used to treat 36 patients with advanced stage primary (n=33) or recurrent (n=3) nasal or paranasal malignant tumors. Full ophthalmologic follow-up was documented. The median dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 69.6 CGE (range 60.8-77). Visual complications were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and the late effects of normal tissue (LENT) scoring systems. The median follow-up was 52.4 months (range 17-122.8). RESULTS: Thirteen patients developed late visual/ocular toxicity. Cataracts were LENT grade 1 and 3 in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One LENT grade 1 vascular retinopathy and 1 optic neuropathy were also observed. Three and five patients presented with nasolacrimal duct stenosis (CTC grade 2, 2 patients; CTC grade 3, 1 patient) and dry-eye syndrome (CTC grade 1, 1 patient; CTC grade 2, 4 patients), respectively. The 3- and 5-year probability of LENT/CTC grade > or =2 visual toxicity were 15.8+/-6.7% and 20.7+/-7.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AFR for locally advanced nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors enables delivery of 70 CGE to the tumor with acceptable ophthalmologic complications

However, no proof of this effect has been provided by clinical trials and related clinical research. Hence, we investigated the radiation biological aspects of high LET carbon beam therapy on cervical cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study involved 49 patients with stage IIIb bulky and stage IVa cervical cancer treated with high LET carbon beams between October 1995 and June 2000. Oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) was measured by using a needle-type polarographic oxygen electrode. RESULTS: The 4-year disease-free survival rates of patients with pO(2) </= 20 mm Hg (hypoxic tumor) and pO(2) > 20 mm Hg (oxygenated tumor) before treatment were 37% and 21%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before treatment were 58% and 54%, respectively. The disease-free survival rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors assessed by oxygen status at the 5th day of irradiation were 33% and 32%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors at the 5th day were 60% and 58%, respectively. There was no significant prognostic difference between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors. CONCLUSION: The similar disease-free survival and local control rates between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before and during treatment indicated that the role of the tumor oxygenation status was not so important in local control in carbon beam therapy. These results indicated that high LET carbon beam irradiation might reduce the radiation-resistant nature stemming from tumor hypoxia

Twenty-five were in stage I (32.1%) and 35 in stage II (67.9%). All patients were submitted to staging laparotomy. Cases with large mediastinal mass were excluded from this series. Delivered doses were 44 Gy in involved areas, 40 Gy on the mediastinum and 36 Gy on uninvolved sites. Twenty-four patients in stage I (96%) and 33 in stage II (94.2%) obtained complete remission. Actuarial 10- and 20-yr overall (OS) rates were 86% and 79.1%, respectively. Event-free (EFS) and relapse-free (RFS) survival rates at 10 and 20 yr were 67.5% and 62.1%, respectively. The occurrence of disease relapse resulted in the only statistical significant prognostic factor for OS in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Distant and extranodal recurrences were significantly (P<0.01) related to a reduced OS. On multivariate analysis stage was the only determinant factor for increased RFS. Extended field RT proved to be an effective curative modality for stage I HD patients, whereas 15 out of 33 patients in stage II relapsed requiring salvage therapy. Long-term analysis of survival and treatment-related morbidity rates will improve our knowledge and assist the physicians to choose the therapeutic option to offer to HD patients

The evolution of childhood CNS malignancy following therapy is reviewed to identify radiation response variables indicating where the proton dose distribution will improve the therapeutic ratio. The review documents that of the 1262 children expected to develop CNS malignancy in 1989, only 43% will survive 5 years. About 75% of those with medulloblastoma and over 90% with astrocytoma die from persistent (in-field) disease. When the patient has been treated with radiation, it is accepted that disease persistence indicates the cancer dose was insufficient. Potentially 536 children could show an improved incidence of local control and improved survival from an increased cancer dose available from proton irradiation. As the total dose and volume of brain irradiated is increased about 1800 cGy, brain dysfunction increases, producing a spectrum of functional and intellectual deficits which are age and volume related. About 900 irradiated patients would have fewer in-field histologic and functional changes if the dose to normal brain, or the volume of brain irradiated, is reduced by an improved dose distribution. A proton beam treatment plan, delivering a cancer dose of 7400 cGy, is simulated for a thalamic astrocytoma. The dose distribution of this plan is compared with an x-ray plan used to treat a patient, in which a dose of 5400 cGy was delivered to the astrocytoma. Comparative isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms indicate a decreased integral dose to normal brain and a decreased volume of normal brain irradiated, even as the cancer dose is boosted 2000 cGy with protons

Heavy-charged-particle radiation has several advantages over protons and photons for the treatment of intracranial lesions; it has an improved physical distribution of the dose deep in tissue, a small angle of lateral scattering, and a sharp distal falloff of the dose. METHODS. We present detailed clinical and radiologic follow-up in 86 patients with symptomatic but surgically inaccessible cerebral arteriovenous malformations that were treated with stereotactic helium-ion Bragg-peak radiation. The doses ranged from 8.8 to 34.6 Gy delivered to volumes of tissue of 0.3 to 70 cm3. RESULTS. Two years after radiation treatment, the rate of complete obliteration of the lesions, as detected angiographically, was 94 percent for lesions smaller than 4 cm3, 75 percent for those of 4 to 25 cm3, and 39 percent for those larger than 25 cm3. After three years, the rates of obliteration were 100, 95, and 70 percent, respectively. Major neurologic complications occurred in 10 patients (12 percent), of whom 8 had permanent deficits. All these complications occurred in the initial stage of the protocol, before the maximal dose of radiation was reduced to 19.2 Gy. In addition, hemorrhage occurred in 10 patients from residual malformations between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures and headaches were less severe in 63 percent of the 35 and 68 percent of the 40 patients, respectively, who had them initially. CONCLUSIONS. Given the natural history of these inaccessible lesions and the high risks of surgery, we conclude that heavy-charged-particle radiation is an effective therapy for symptomatic, surgically inaccessible intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: a prolonged latency period before complete obliteration of the vascular lesion and a small risk of serious neurologic complications

The time between start of helium ion treatment and recognition of metastatic disease ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 27 months). The mean pretreatment tumor height in the patients with metastases was 7.7 mm. All 42 patients who developed metastatic disease have died. The median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease was 5 months; the longest survival was 49 months. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (n = 34). Four (10%) of the 42 patients with metastases also had local recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis identified three variables that predicted independently the development of metastases and lack of survival. These variables are anterior location of tumor (P = .027), tumor height greater than 5 mm (P = .02), and tumor diameter greater than 10 mm (P = .0075)

We sought to determine if MI levels correlate with cerebral astrocytoma grade. METHODS: Five control subjects, 14 patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 10 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent single-volume HMRS with an echo time of 20 ms. Twenty-five patients had received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy previously. Using the curve-fitting program supplied by the manufacturer, peak areas for n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and MI were normalized with respect to the peak area of creatine (Cr). Ratios for MI/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr were obtained for each lesion and retrospectively compared with the histologic grade of the lesion. RESULTS: Levels of MI/Cr were higher (0.82 +/- 0.25) in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, intermediate (0.49 +/- 0.07) in control subjects, and lower in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (0.33 +/- 0.16) and GBM (0.15 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a trend toward lower MI levels in the presence of anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs compared with those of low-grade astrocytomas. MI levels may have implications in the grading of cerebral astrocytomas

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 61.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.6%-68.3%) for conventional-dose and 80.4% (95% confidence interval, 74.7%-86.1%) for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 49% reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was observed in both the low-risk and the higher-risk subgroups (risk reduction, 51% [P<.001] and 44% [P = .03], respectively). There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity

1	4044	Visual outcome after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Eye, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Regression Analysis, Risk, Survival, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	Prognostic factors for visual loss following proton irradiation of uveal melanoma were evaluated for 440 eyes treated from 1975 to 1984, with visual acuity 20/200 or better before treatment. Analysis involved Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards analysis with visual outcome defined as worse than 20/200. Prognostic factors were tumor height: rate ratio (ratio of rate of visual loss for one category of the variable relative to the rate of visual loss for a reference category of that variable) of 5.26 (95% confidence interval, 2.66-10.39) for tumors greater than 5 mm compared to tumors 3.0 mm or less in height; distance of tumor from the optic disc and fovea: rate ratio 2.59 (1.63-4.11) for tumors 2DD or less from both the optic disc and fovea compared to those greater than 2 DD from these structures. Also predictive of visual loss were tumor location close to disc only, or close to fovea only, macular detachment, worse pretreatment vision, and higher radiation doses delivered to both the disc and fovea, and lens. Regression analysis using a visual acuity scale gave similar results

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the frequency of HP dysfunction in adults after RT for nonpituitary brain tumors. METHOD: We studied 56 adult patients who received external beam RT for primary nonpituitary brain tumors at time intervals of 12-150 months after RT. The control group consisted of 20 RT-naive patients with primary brain tumors. GH and adrenal axes were assessed using the insulin tolerance test or the glucagon stimulation test. Gonadotroph, thyrotroph, and lactotroph function were assessed using baseline blood measurements. The biological effective dose (BED) to the HP axis was calculated in the RT patients. RESULTS: Hypopituitarism was present in 41% of patients. The frequency of GH, ACTH, gonadotropin, and TSH deficiencies, and hyperprolactinemia was 32, 21, 27, 9, and 32%, respectively. Any degree of hypopituitarism and GH deficiency was significantly associated with longer time interval from RT and greater BED. However, gonadotropin deficiency and hyperprolactinemia were only related to BED, whereas ACTH deficiency was only significantly associated with the time interval from RT. One RT-naive patient was GH deficient. CONCLUSION: Adult patients treated with cranial irradiation for primary nonpituitary brain tumors are at high risk of hypopituitarism, which is time and dose dependent. Long-term surveillance and periodic evaluation are needed. We recommend that adult late effect clinics, similar to those for children, should be established

Both treatments induce growth arrest within the tumour and its slow involution over several years. Although ocular retention rates are excellent, regrowth of tumours due to resistance and neovascular glaucoma leads to enucleation of up to 10% of affected eyes. Proton irradiation involves part of the iris in most cases and we noticed that neovascularisation only occurred in the part of the iris that was not irradiated. We therefore conducted this study to determine the relationship between the development of iris neovascularisation and iris irradiation. METHODS: A total of 21 enucleation specimens from patients who had previously had proton irradiation were collected from the files of the Department of Pathology, Moorfields Eye Hospital during the 5-year period from 1994 to 1999. Sections of these eyes were assessed for VEGF-A, bFGF, and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) by immunohistochemistry. Ophthalmic notes and radiotherapy records were reviewed to assess the extent of iris irradiation. RESULTS: In all, 11 cases showed clinical evidence of iris neovascularisation and were selected for further study. Three of these eyes also showed clinical evidence of regrowth of the tumour. Histological evidence of iris neovascularization was noted in all 11 of the eyes examined, and was only present in the nonirradiated side of the iris in 8/11 eyes. NVI was present on both sides of the iris in three cases, but was less severe in the irradiated part. Expression of VEGF-A was at most weak within the tumour, but was present in the detached retina and in the epithelium of both ciliary body and iris. Some bFGF staining was noted around vessels in the iris stroma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that irradiation leads to iris atrophy, and that atrophic, irradiated iris is resistant to the development of neovascularisation

METHODS: Three hundred nineteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer and initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 15.0 ng/mL or less received conformal radiation doses of 74 to 75 cobalt gray equivalent with protons alone or combined with photons. No patient had pre- or post-treatment hormonal therapy until disease progression was documented. Patients were evaluated for biochemical disease-free survival, PSA nadir, and toxicity; the mean and median follow-up period was 43 months. RESULTS: Overall 5-year clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates were 97% and 88%, respectively. Initial PSA level, stage, and post-treatment PSA nadir were independent prognostic variables for biochemical disease-free survival: a PSA nadir 0.5 ng/mL or less was associated with a 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rate of 98%, versus 88% and 42% for nadirs 0.51 to 1.0 and greater than 1.0 ng/mL, respectively. No severe treatment-related morbidity was seen. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that patients treated with conformal protons have 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rates comparable to those who undergo radical prostatectomy, and display no significant toxicity.

The purpose of our study was to define parameters from single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy that provide a probability measure for differentiating neoplastic from radiation-induced, nonneoplastic lesions. METHODS: Seventy-two lesions in 56 patients were examined using a combined MR imaging and MR spectroscopy protocol (point-resolved spectroscopy, TE = 135 ms). Signal intensities of cholines, creatines, N-acetyl aspartate, and the presence of lactate and lipid resonances were correlated to final diagnoses established by clinical and MR imaging follow-up, positron emission tomography studies, or biopsy/surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test, linear discriminant analysis, and k nearest-neighbor method. RESULTS: Significantly increased signal intensity ratios I(tCho)/I(tCr) (P <.0001) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) (P <.0001) were observed in neoplastic (n = 34) compared with nonneoplastic lesions (n = 32) and contralateral normal brain (n = 33). Analysis of I(tCho)/I(tCr) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) data yielded correct retrospective classification as neoplastic and nonneoplastic in 82% and 81% of the lesions, respectively. Neither I(NAA)/I(tCr) nor signal intensitities of lactate or lipids were useful for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Metabolic information provided by proton MR spectroscopy is useful for the differentiation of neoplastic and nonneoplastic brain lesions after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors

BSRT is a description of an emerging radiation oncology procedure, where simulation, CT scan, treatment planning, and radiation treatment are synchronized with voluntary breath-hold, forced breath-hold, or breathing gating. The BSRT system consists of a breathing monitoring system (BMOS) and a linear accelerator gating hardware and software package. Two methods, a video camera-based method and the use of wraparound inductive plethysmography (RespiTrace), generate the BMOS signals. The BMOS signals and the synchronized fluoroscopic images are simultaneously recorded in the simulation room and are later analyzed to define the ideal treatment point (ITP) where organ motion is stationary. The BMOS signals at ITP can be used to gate a CT scanner or a linear accelerator to maintain the same organ configuration as in the simulation. The BSRT system allows breath-hold or gating. This dual role allows the system to be applicable for a variety of patients, i.e., the breath-hold method for those patients who can maintain and reproduce the ITP, and the forced breath-hold or gating method for those who are not ideal for voluntary breath-hold

1	4741	Neutron activation of patients following boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors at the high flux reactor (HFR) Petten (EORTC Trials 11961 and 11011)	Body Burden, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Environmental Exposure/an [Analysis], Germany, Head, Humans, Isotopes, Linear Energy Transfer, Methods, Netherlands, Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Nuclear Reactors, Patients, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Monitoring/mt [Methods], Radiation Protection, Radiation Protection/mt [Methods], Radioisotopes, Radioisotopes/an [Analysis], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Time, Universities	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At the High Flux Reactor (HFR), Petten, The Netherlands, EORTC clinical trials of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) have been in progress since 1997. BNCT involves the irradiation of cancer patients by a beam of neutrons, with an energy range of predominantly 1 eV to 10 keV. The patient is infused with a tumor-seeking, (10)B-loaded compound prior to irradiation. Neutron capture in the (10)B atoms results in a high local radiation dose to the tumor cells, whilst sparing the healthy tissue. Neutron capture, however, also occurs in other atoms naturally present in tissue, sometimes resulting in radionuclides that will be present after treatment. The patient is therefore, following BNCT, radioactive. The importance of this induced activity with respect to the absorbed dose in the patient as well as to the radiation exposure of the staff has been investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As a standard radiation protection procedure, the ambient dose equivalent rate was measured on all patients following BNCT using a dose ratemeter. Furthermore, some of the patients underwent measurements using a gamma-ray spectrometer to identify which elements and confirm which isotopes are activated. RESULTS: Peak levels, i.e., at contact and directly after irradiation, are of the order of 40-60 muSv/h, falling to < 10 muSv/h 30-50 min after treatment. The average ambient dose equivalent in the first 2 h at a distance of 2 m from the patient is in the order of 2.5 muSv. The ambient dose equivalent rate in 2 m distance from the patient's head at the earliest time of leaving the reactor center (20 min after the end of treatment) is far less than 1 muSv/h. The main radioisotopes were identified as (38)Cl, (49)Ca, and (24)Na. Furthermore, in two patients, the isotopes (198)Au and (116m)In were also present. The initial activity is predominantly due to (49)Ca, whilst the remaining activity is predominantly due to (24)Na. CONCLUSION: The absorbed dose resulting from the activated isotopes in the irradiated volume is in the order of < 1% of the prescribed dose and therefore does not add a significant contribution to the absorbed dose in the target volume. In other parts of the patient's body, the absorbed dose by induced activity is magnitudes smaller and can be neglected. The levels of radiation received by staff members and non-radiation workers (i.e., accompanying persons) are well below the recommended limits	
1	2952	Mixed beam radiation therapy for unresectable squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck: the results of a randomized RTOG study	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Clinical Trials as Topic, Fast Neutrons, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Larynx, Male, Middle Aged, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Random Allocation, Survival	Three hundred and twenty-two patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were entered on a randomized study comparing "mixed beam" radiation therapy with photon radiation therapy. Patients with histologically proven tumors of T-stage T2, T3, or T4 and any N-stage originating in the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were eligible. One hundred forty-five patients were randomized to photon treatment and 177 were randomized to mixed beam treatment. No significant differences could be demonstrated between the experimental and control groups for primary tumor control or overall survival, although there was an advantage for mixed beam treatment over photon treatment for patients with metastatic cervical adenopathy (69 vs. 55% complete response rate in the nodes, p = .024). It is concluded that mixed beam radiation therapy does not offer a significant advantage over photon radiation therapy for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck

METHODS: Twenty males and 6 females were submitted to external beam therapy with 4-6 MV X-rays and received 60-70 Gy in fractions of 180 cGY to 200 cGy per day, 5 days a week. Radiation therapy technique was two posterior oblique portals and a single anterior field at 100 cm SAD. After 4500 cGy portals were coned down, holding the spinal cord dose below 4500 cGy. RESULTS: Global response to therapy was 73.1%. Median survival was 11 months. The 2-year survival rate was 12.5% in patients with lesions smaller than 5 cm and 5.5% for those with lesions greater than 5 cm. Patients with grade 2 dysphagia had a median survival of 16 months, those with grade 1, 11 months and 2 patients with grade 0, 4 and 9 months. In all patients mild to moderate esophagitis was observed. Two patients developed esophagotracheal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusively radiotherapy cannot be considered the treatment of choice in III stage patients. Primary chemoradiotherapy may emerge as the treatment of choice for cancer of the esophagus

1	891	Preliminary assessment of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in predicting treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for relapse.[see comment]	Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm Staging, Physics, Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Radiation, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome	The purpose of the study was to determine whether 3D proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can predict treatment outcome in high risk patients with prostate cancer. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRSI were performed in 16 patients with prostate cancer who were considered high risk because of clinical stage T3-4, Gleason score>/=8, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL. Patients were treated with chemotherapy/hormone therapy, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, and were followed for PSA relapse (follow-up, 19-43 months). The ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate was used to localize peripheral zone cancer. An MRSI risk score on a scale of 0-3 was derived from the volume and degree of metabolic abnormality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging risk score, MRI tumor/node (TN) stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA were used as predictors of pathologic stage in patients treated with RP (n=10) and PSA relapse in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage (P<0.01) and MRSI risk score (P<0.05) correlated with pathologic stage, but clinical stage did not (P=0.35). Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage was the only significant predictor of PSA relapse in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). Although the MRSI risk score did not reach significance (P=0.13), 6 patients with a score<0.9 were relapse-free, whereas 7 of 10 patients with a score>0.9 relapsed. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI risk assessments agreed in 15 of 16 patients. These preliminary results suggest that tumor metabolic assessment may indicate treatment outcome in high-risk patients with prostate cancer. Although MRSI did not provide added prognostic value to MRI in this small number of patients, MRSI might increase the confidence of the clinician in assessing risk on MRI by contributing supporting metabolic data

Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome

This study was designed to evaluate the QOL of disease-freely survival NPC patients after treatment, and to investigate the factors correlated with their QOL. METHODS: From Jul. to Aug. 2003, disease-freely survival NPC patients who had been treated from 1999 to 2000 in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University were enrolled. The Chinese SF-36 questionnaire and a checklist consists of 14 items about self-rating symptoms were self-reported by all participants at clinic. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the patients were also collected, and their relationships with SF-36 data and symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were enrolled in the study. The median survival time was 3.6 years (ranged 2.4-4.6 years). Xerostomia was the first common symptom, followed by hypoacusis, hypomnesia, dysphagia, and trismus. Univariate analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, monthly income, economic status, religion, and the number of complications had influences on QOL; the patients in earlier T and N stages, irradiated by linear accelerator, with lower total dose and weekly dosage to the nasopharynx and neck, and those who had anterior nasal field radiation reported better QOL. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the number of complications, monthly income, age, and T stage were independent factors affecting total QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Improving radiotherapy might enhance physical functions of NPC patients. The prevention and control of chronic diseases, the development of economy, and the increase of income may promote NPC patients' QOL

Twenty tumors (1.9%) exhibited definitive growth between 4 months and 66 months after irradiation (median, 19 months): 10 were marginal recurrences, 5 were ring melanomas, 3 were uncontrolled tumors, and 2 were extrascleral extensions. Ten of these eyes were enucleated without further intervention, 2 patients died of metastases soon after the growth was detected, and 8 patients had further conservative therapy. In 5 other patients, tumor growth was suspected but unconfirmed and the eye was enucleated elsewhere; the 5-year probability of local tumor control based on 25 recurrences was 97% +/- 1%. There was a nonsignificant increase in the rate of metastases among patients with documented tumor recurrence (adjusted relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 3.4). Results suggest that recurrence of uveal melanomas treated by proton beam therapy is uncommon, but that treatment failure may increase risk of death from metastasis

1	411	Preferences of healthy inner city women and the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Mastectomy/mt [Methods], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Patient Education as Topic, Patient Satisfaction, Prospective Studies, Recurrence, Socioeconomic Factors, Treatment Outcome, Urban Population	Numerous studies have shown that women of a lower education level and socioeconomic status use less breast-conserving surgery than women of a higher education level and socioeconomic status. Surveys of healthy women and the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer have been performed. However, no survey has focused exclusively on inner city women. The objective of this study was to determine the awareness, preferences, and concerns of inner-city, multiethnic women and the surgical treatment of stage I and II breast cancer, and to identify if a distinct treatment preference for mastectomy or lumpectomy exists in such a population. The study consisted of a prospective survey of volunteers, age 18 years and older, in the nononcologic clinics of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, New York. We consecutively surveyed 200 women between the ages of 18 and 75 using a 12-item form from January 2004 to May 2004. Of 200 surveys, 21 were excluded as incomplete and two women surveyed who gave a prior history of breast cancer were excluded from study, leaving 177 total surveys for analysis. Women were presented with a hypothetical diagnosis of early stage breast cancer curable by mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Women were asked about their surgery preferences, who they would seek advice from, if they would let their physician decide treatment, and their concerns if faced with a diagnosis of breast cancer. One hundred seventy-seven completed surveys were obtained; 124 (70%) women chose lumpectomy and radiation, 48 (27%) chose mastectomy, and 5 (3%) chose no treatment. Women who were educated below the collegiate level were more likely to prefer breast conservation therapy compared with those with a college education and above (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0, 3.6). Overall, most women surveyed (62%) were concerned with cancer recurrence followed by the side effects of radiation therapy (19%). Most women surveyed (63%) would make their physician principal advisor, whereas some (23%) would make their significant other the principal advisor. More women who chose mastectomy would make their physician their principal advisor (80%) versus those who chose lumpectomy (65%). More than 80 per cent of the women surveyed would have their physician decide their treatment. The women in the present study exhibited a distinct preference for breast conservation therapy over mastectomy

1	1039	Matching the dosimetry characteristics of a dual-field Stanford technique to a customized single-field Stanford technique for total skin electron therapy	Air, Electrons, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Head, Humans, Lymphoma,T-Cell,Cutaneous/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Whole-Body Irradiation/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To compare the dosimetry characteristics of a customized single-field and a matching dual-field electron beam for total skin electron therapy (TSET) within the framework of the Stanford technique. To examine and quantify its impact on patient dosimetry. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two characteristically different electron beams were used for TSET employing the Stanford technique: a single-field beam created from a pencil beam of electrons passing through 7 meters of air and a dual-field beam created from two heavily scattered electron beams directed at oblique angles to patients. The dosimetry characteristics of the two beams were measured by using ionization chambers, radiographic films, and thermal luminescent detectors. The impact of beam characteristic on patient dosimetry was quantified on both anthromorphic phantoms and on patients. Treatment protocols aimed at matching the patient dose between the two systems were established on the basis of these and other measurements. RESULTS: The dual-field beam was matched to the single-field beam, resulting in approximately the same mean energy (approximately 4.0 MeV) and most probable energy (approximately 4.5 MeV) at their respective treatment source-to-patient-surface distance (SSD). The depth dose curves on the beam axis were nearly identical for both beams. X-ray contamination on the beam axis was 0.43% for the dual-field beam, slightly higher than that (0.4%) of the single-field beam. The beam uniformity, however, was quite different: the dual-field beam was more uniform in the vertical direction but was worse in the lateral direction compared to the single-field beam. For a TSET treatment using the Stanford technique, the composite depth dose curves were nearly identically at the level of beam axis: with an effective depth of maximum buildup (d(max)) at approximately 1 mm below the skin surface and the depth to 80% depth dose at around 6 mm. The overall X-ray contamination was approximately 1.0% and 1.2% for the single-field and dual-field system, respectively. Away from the beam axis level, treatment using either beam was able to deliver over 90% of prescription dose to the main body surfaces. For body surfaces tangential to the beam axis (e.g., top of head and shoulders), the dose was low especially when using the dual-field beam. By adding boost radiation to the tangential surfaces and by adjusting the planned shielding for critical structures, the total dose to the patient over a complete course of TSET treatment could be matched closely for the two systems. CONCLUSIONS: Although the depth doses can be matched at the level of the beam axis, there exist some characteristic differences in the angular distribution of the electrons between the large SSD single-field beam and the short SSD dual-field beam. These differences resulted in lower dose delivered to "tangential" body surfaces and to body structures that extended farther laterally when using the dual-field beam. However, by adjusting the treatment protocol regarding the boost irradiation and planned shielding, the total dose to patients from a complete course of TSET treatment using the dual-field beam can be matched to that given by the single-field beam. Special attention should be paid to the dosimetry at the "tangential" body surfaces when commissioning a dual-field TSET system

The patients were treated with (1) a 60Co machine equipped with 45-degree wedge filters, at a total dose of 6,000-7,000 cGy, 300 cGy per fraction, 3 days a week in the period from 1970-1974; (2) 10 MeV linear accelerator X-rays from 1975-1980, and (3) 10 MeV linear accelerator X-rays and/or the 60Co machine in the period from 1981-1985, at a total dose of 6,000-7,000 cGy, 5 days a week by parallel opposing portals without wedge filters. The 5-year local control rates by radiotherapy alone were 66%, 78%, and 83%, respectively, in the three periods, and the 5-year survival rates were 77%, 97%, and 96% following salvage surgery for recurrent disease. In the 1970-1974 period, four patients developed severe laryngeal edema, and two patients had total laryngectomy without local residual tumor. In the 1975-1985 period, 16 patients had local recurrence in five years, and in five of them the tumor exhibited verrucous-like histopathological findings. In the 1975-1980 period, local recurrence was considered to result from underdosing of lesions with 10 MV X-ray beams and split-course irradiation. In the last five years of the period, the 5-year local control rate for stage I and II carcinoma of the glottis, excluding verrucous-like carcinoma, reached 90% with 10 MV X-rays combined with 60Co gamma-rays

The treatment is based on a versatile, non-invasive interface for stereotactic localization of the brain target imaged by computed tomography (CT), angiography or magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), and subsequent repetitive stereotactic irradiation of the target using a linear accelerator. The fractionation of the stereotactic irradiation was intended to meet the requirements of the basic principles of radiobiology. The radiophysical evaluation using phantoms, and the clinical results in a small number of patients, demonstrated a good reproducibility between repeated positionings of the target in the isocenter of the accelerator, and a high degree of accuracy in the treatment of brain lesions

This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy

One hundred and sixteen patients were treated with conventional pelvic megavoltage x-ray therapy. Sixty-four patients were treated with combined pelvic x-ray therapy plus a perineal proton beam boost to a carefully defined prostatic tumor volume. A 160 MeV proton beam has been modified to irradiate patients with localized tumors by using conventional treatment schedules. This proton beam has the physical advantage over megavoltage x-rays of reducing the dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. By using the proton beam boost we have delivered an increased prostatic tumor dose of 500 to 700 cGy without increasing treatment morbidity at all. The two groups are actuarially analyzed for patient survival, disease-free survival and local recurrence-free survival, and thus far, no significant differences have been noted. Because of the minimal complications observed in the proton group despite a 10% increase in dose, a randomized clinical trial comparing these two treatment techniques is studied

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1981 and November 1996, 46 patients with partially resected, biopsied, or recurrent meningiomas (median age of 50 years; range 11-74 years) were treated with combined photon and 160-MeV proton beam therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, using computed tomography-based conformal 3D treatment planning. Nine patients were treated after incomplete tumor resection, 8 patients after tumor biopsy only, and 29 patients after tumor recurrence following gross total (10/29 patients) or progression after subtotal (19/29 patients) resection. All patients were classified as benign meningioma on review slides at MGH. The median dose to the macroscopic gross tumor volume was 59.0 CGE (range 53.1-74.1 CGE, CGE = proton Gy x 1.1 RBE). The median follow-up was 53 months (range 12-207). RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 93 and 77%, respectively, and the recurrence-free rate at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 88%, respectively. Survival without severe toxicity was 80% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients presented with local tumor recurrence at 61, 95, and 125 months. One patient developed distant intradural metastasis at 21 and 88 months. No patient died from recurrent meningioma; however, 4 patients died of other causes. A fifth patient died from a brainstem necrosis after 22 months. Eight patients developed severe long-term toxicity from radiotherapy, including ophthalmologic (4 patients), neurologic (4 patients), and otologic (2 patients) complications. All patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic nerve structures in the current protocol. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with recurrent or incompletely resected benign intracranial menigiomas. Observed toxicity appears to be dose-related; with currently employed dose constraints, toxicity should not exceed that seen in patients treated with conformal fractionated supervoltage photon radiotherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1981 and November 1996, 46 patients with partially resected, biopsied, or recurrent meningiomas (median age of 50 years; range 11-74 years) were treated with combined photon and 160-MeV proton beam therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, using computed tomography-based conformal 3D treatment planning. Nine patients were treated after incomplete tumor resection, 8 patients after tumor biopsy only, and 29 patients after tumor recurrence following gross total (10/29 patients) or progression after subtotal (19/29 patients) resection. All patients were classified as benign meningioma on review slides at MGH. The median dose to the macroscopic gross tumor volume was 59.0 CGE (range 53.1-74.1 CGE, CGE = proton Gy x 1.1 RBE). The median follow-up was 53 months (range 12-207). RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 93 and 77%, respectively, and the recurrence-free rate at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 88%, respectively. Survival without severe toxicity was 80% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients presented with local tumor recurrence at 61, 95, and 125 months. One patient developed distant intradural metastasis at 21 and 88 months. No patient died from recurrent meningioma; however, 4 patients died of other causes. A fifth patient died from a brainstem necrosis after 22 months. Eight patients developed severe long-term toxicity from radiotherapy, including ophthalmologic (4 patients), neurologic (4 patients), and otologic (2 patients) complications. All patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic nerve structures in the current protocol. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with recurrent or incompletely resected benign intracranial menigiomas. Observed toxicity appears to be dose-related; with currently employed dose constraints, toxicity should not exceed that seen in patients treated with conformal fractionated supervoltage photon radiotherapy

The radiobiological arguments for high-LET radiation in cancer therapy are reviewed: reduction of OER in the case of hypoxic and poorly-reoxygenating tumours, and the lesser importance of repair phenomena which are a problem in controlling repair-proficient photon-resistant tumours. Fast neutrons were the first type of high-LET radiation used clinically, and were often applied under suboptimal technical conditions. Nevertheless, useful clinical information was derived from the neutron experience. A greater benefit from neutrons than from conventional radiotherapy was found for several tumour sites. The present discussion is limited to the results for salivary gland tumours and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Based on the fast neutron experience, radiobiological arguments, and the added benefit of excellent physical selectivity of ion beams, the potential clinical indications for high-LET ions are discussed: hypoxic, slowly growing and well-differentiated photon-resistant tumours. One of the main remaining issues is the selection of individual patients for high- or low-LET radiation. Since the physical selectivity of ions now matches that obtained with other techniques, the selection of patients will be based only on the radiobiological characteristics of the tumour

METHODS: Retrospective review of the charts of patients with iris melanoma treated by proton beam therapy between April 1998 and September 2002. Ciliary body melanomas with iris involvement or tumours with extrascleral invasion were excluded. Treatment consisted of 60 Gy of proton beam irradiation delivered in four fractions to the tumour volume. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated, median follow-up of 33 months (8-72 months). 15 patients presented a lesion with documented growth. The median clinical diameter was 5 mm (2-8 mm), the median ultrasound diameter 4.8 mm (2-7.7 mm) The patients were 6% T1, 57.1% T2, and 14.3% T3 all N0M0. The iridocorneal angle was invaded by the tumour in 71.4% of patients. At the end of follow-up, all patients were alive with no proven metastatic disease except one patient with suspicious liver lesions. None of the patients showed tumour progression or ocular relapse. The tumour response at 2 years was a flat lesion for 6.3% of cases, partial regression in 75% and stable in 18.8%. None of the patients required secondary enucleation. The main complication was cataract (45% within 24 months of treatment). Raised intraocular pressure was observed in 15% of patients but no neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy shows potential utility for selected cases of localised iris melanomas allowing excellent local tumour control and eye preservation. Further follow-up on larger series is needed to confirm these results

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

This study, prompted by reports of transient (30% each) and permanent (10% each) facial and trigeminal neuropathy after stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas with marginal doses of 16-20 Gy, assessed whether proton beam radiosurgery using a marginal dose of only 12 Gy could control vestibular schwannomas while causing less neuropathy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 67 years) were treated between 1992 and 1998. The mean tumor volume was 2.49 cm(3). The dose to the tumor margin (70% isodose line) was 12 Gy. The prospectively specified follow-up consisted of neurologic evaluation and MRI at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: After a mean clinical follow-up of 44 months and imaging follow-up of 34 months in 64 patients, 35 tumors (54.7%) were smaller and 25 (39.1%) were unchanged (tumor control rate 94%; actuarial control rate 94% at 2 years and 84% at 5 years). Three tumors enlarged: one shrank after repeated radiosurgery, one remained enlarged at the time of unrelated death, and one had not been imaged for 4 years in a patient who remained asymptomatic at last follow-up. Intratumoral hemorrhage into one stable tumor required craniotomy that proved successful. Thus, 97% of tumors required no additional treatment. Three patients (4.7%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus evident as increased ataxia. Of 6 patients with functional hearing ipsilaterally, 1 improved, 1 was unchanged, and 4 progressively lost hearing. Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications

Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications

1	4216	3-D comparative study of proton vs. x-ray radiation therapy for rectal cancer	Aged, Boston, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, X-Rays	To assess the usefulness of proton beams for treatment of patients with rectal cancer, we have performed comparative 3D treatment planning for proton beam and x-ray beam therapy. Three common x-ray techniques (AP-PA, 3-field, and 4-field box), a proton beam only plan, and a proton boost plan were compared. The plan which would have been treated without the aid of the 3D planning system was also simulated. Dose distributions were analyzed and dose-volume histograms computed for the target volumes and critical normal tissues. Analyses of these plans demonstrate that the proton beam techniques reduce the volume of small bowel irradiated. This may allow higher doses to be delivered to the tumor, with a probable increase in local control, or a reduction in normal tissue complications probability. All the plans developed with the 3D planning system treated significantly less bowel than the one planned without it	
1	3435	Role of stereotactic radiosurgery with a linear accelerator in treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children	Adolescent, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebral Angiography, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Massachusetts, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Between 1986 and 1988, 16 children were treated for 10 arteriovenous malformations and 6 recurrent intracranial tumors with stereotactic radiation therapy using a modified Clinac 6/100 linear accelerator. The median age of our patients was 10.5 years. For the group with arteriovenous malformation, follow-up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (median was 20 months). No patient bled during the follow-up period. Five of eight patients with follow-up longer than 12 months have achieved complete obliteration of their arteriovenous malformation by angiogram. The four remaining patients who have not achieved a complete obliteration are awaiting their 2-year posttreatment angiogram. The other patient has been treated within the year and have not yet been studied. Five of the six recurrent tumor patients are alive with a median follow-up of 8 months. The remaining patient was controlled locally, but he died of recurrent disease outside the area treated with radiosurgery. The radiographic responses of these patients have included three complete responses, two substantial reductions in tumor volume (greater than 50%) and one stabilization. Despite previous radiotherapy, there have been no significant complications in these patients. We conclude that stereotactic radiation therapy using a standard linear accelerator is an effective and safe technique in the treatment of selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children. In addition, stereotactic radiosurgery may have unique applications in the treatment of localized primary and recurrent pediatric brain tumors

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1983 proton radiotherapy using 250 MeV proton beams produced by a booster synchrotron of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics has been carried out at Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. As of September 1990, a total of 147 patients received a partial or full treatment with proton beams with curative intent; 92 patients (63%) were treated with proton beams alone and 55 patients (37%) with combined photon and proton beams. There were 91 males and the mean age was 61.8 years old. The follow-up observation period ranged from 10 to 97 months. With regard to a total tumor dose, nearly 80% of patients received 70 Gy or more and 53% received 80 Gy or more. While dose-fractionations used depended upon tumor sites, the large majority of patients received substantially high radiation doses in terms of larger total doses (> 70 Gy) and larger fraction sizes (> 2.5 Gy) than those traditionally used. This fractionation regimen has been used because of limited availability of the accelerator or a shortage of machine time (27-30 weeks/year, 3-3.5 hr/day), and also by the expectation that the superior dose distribution possible with protons will permit administration of high radiation doses without increasing morbidities. In connection with this, we have determined the target volume by setting margins around the tumor boundary as practically small as possible, ranging from 5 to 10 mm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current trial has been based on a site and dose searching program, hence a wide variety of tumor sites including the aerodigestive organs has been treated. So far, our judgment is that proton therapy has proven of potential advantage in treatment of the lung, esophageal, liver, uterine cervix, prostate, and head and neck malignancies; and of possible value in treatment of high-grade gliomas, and gastric, urinary bladder, and pediatric tumors

During a period of three days, three daily fractions of 3 Gy each were applied with intervals of four hours, resulting in a total dose of 27 Gy. Using this fractionation schedule introduced by Ammon, a reduction of metastasis-associated pain was achieved in 90% of cases (54/60). The onset of pain reduction was observed earlier than seen with conventional fractionation schedules (five fractions of 2 Gy each per week, total dose 40 Gy). With regard to objective treatment effects, no significant difference was found between accelerated irradiation and conventional fractionation, the rate of remineralization being 43% (26/60), and the rate of stabilization of formerly progressive bone destructions being 55% (33/60). Accelerated irradiation was tolerated well usually. Marked acute side reactions occurred in only one case with metastatic involvement of joint and reaction of synovia. The major advantage of accelerated irradiation is the shortening of the total treatment period and the consequent reduction of treatment stress in patients with advanced cancer

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

First, an analysis of treatment angle combinations for 50 patients treated with conventional conformal radiation therapy is performed. In a second step, nine treatment plans for a hypothetical heavy ion gantry were prepared. Finally, cylindrical projections of the organs at risk are introduced as a tool to analyse the distribution of treatment angles as well as the treatment geometry for each patient. The results of the analysis for conventional therapy clearly show treatment angle combinations that are preferably used. These findings are also supported by the geometrical analysis using the cylindrical projections. The majority of treatment angles for heavy ions also seem to be confined to those regions. In one case, however, the sharp distal dose fall-off of the heavy ions allowed a beam direction outside these conventionally used regions. The advantages of a heavy ion gantry versus a fixed horizontal beam line are shown by comparison of treatment plans for both systems.

1	1746	Uveal melanomas. Conservation treatment. [Review] [67 refs]	Boston, Brachytherapy, Breast, Helium, Humans, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Probability, Prostate, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Risk, Survival, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision	Eye conservation can be achieved in patients with uveal melanomas by several techniques, with external beam charged particle (proton) therapy and episcleral radionuclide plaque therapy being used most commonly. The probability of visual preservation and of eye retention with either technique is related to tumor size and location. If vision is poor or absent in the fellow eye, even very large tumors can be treated with the proton beam, with a 75% to 80% probability of eye salvage and preservation of some degree of visual function. Local control is achieved in a large proportion of treated eyes with either technique probably because of the large doses that can be focally administered to these relatively small tumors with those techniques. Achieving local control may also contribute to improved survival in some patients. Survival clearly has not been compromised. Useful vision is preserved in eyes with tumors occurring in a favorable location with respect to the optic disc or macula. A dose-searching trial, aimed at improving visual outcome in patients with tumors in unfavorable locations, has been completed and has provided data to aid in designing future trials. Successfully treating uveal melanoma without removal of the involved eye is one of the major oncologic triumphs of the latter part of the 20th century. Very high rates of local control can be achieved with heavy charged particle external beam radiotherapy or 125I episcleral plaque brachytherapy, with preservation of a functionally useful eye in many patients. The excellent results in the eye melanoma patients treated with external beam proton therapy also demonstrate that almost all the patients can successfully cooperate in their treatment by voluntarily fixating the eye on a particular point during treatment, so that their tumor is positioned properly in the beam during treatment. Conservative treatment can achieve local control rates similar to or superior to those achieved with radiation therapy alone in other commonly treated solid tumors, including early stage carcinomas of the breast, vocal cord, and prostate. Continued careful follow-up of conservatively treated patients will provide even better understanding of the radiation effects on uveal melanomas and on normal ocular structures. It is also impressive that these gains have not been achieved at a cost of increased mortality: survival rates in irradiated patients are at least as good as after enucleation. Further observation will reveal whether these initial dramatic and encouraging results will be maintained. The COMS Study may provide additional data in this regard at least regarding survival after brachytherapy relative to enucleation. It will not, however, clarify indications for the two types of radiotherapy (brachytherapy and charged particle therapy) nor will it allow direct comparisons of acute and chronic ocular effects of those therapeutic modalities. The UCSF-LBL trial mentioned previously, which compared helium ion therapy with 125I episcleral plaque treatment, has documented the superiority of charged particle therapy to plaque therapy in terms of local tumor control and eye retention. Of interest is a recent survey reporting that choice of treatment for uveal melanoma did not seem to be associated with large differences in quality of life when assessed at long-term follow-up. The distant failures and metastatic deaths in uveal melanoma patients, more common with larger and more anteriorly located tumors, are most distressing. A randomized clinical trial of adjuvant systemic therapy is clearly indicated but has not been mounted because of the relatively poor results obtained with systemic therapy in metastatic melanoma patients. The recent report of improved survival in cutaneous melanoma patients at high risk for metastasis who were treated with interferon is encouraging, and it led to the initiation of the nonrandomized study described previously, which uses interferon following proton eye irradiation for patients with increased risk of metastasis. Other trials would clearly be indicated if more effective systemic therapies become available. [References: 67]	
1	1746	Uveal melanomas. Conservation treatment. [Review] [67 refs]	Boston, Brachytherapy, Breast, Helium, Humans, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Probability, Prostate, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Risk, Survival, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision	Eye conservation can be achieved in patients with uveal melanomas by several techniques, with external beam charged particle (proton) therapy and episcleral radionuclide plaque therapy being used most commonly. The probability of visual preservation and of eye retention with either technique is related to tumor size and location. If vision is poor or absent in the fellow eye, even very large tumors can be treated with the proton beam, with a 75% to 80% probability of eye salvage and preservation of some degree of visual function. Local control is achieved in a large proportion of treated eyes with either technique probably because of the large doses that can be focally administered to these relatively small tumors with those techniques. Achieving local control may also contribute to improved survival in some patients. Survival clearly has not been compromised. Useful vision is preserved in eyes with tumors occurring in a favorable location with respect to the optic disc or macula. A dose-searching trial, aimed at improving visual outcome in patients with tumors in unfavorable locations, has been completed and has provided data to aid in designing future trials. Successfully treating uveal melanoma without removal of the involved eye is one of the major oncologic triumphs of the latter part of the 20th century. Very high rates of local control can be achieved with heavy charged particle external beam radiotherapy or 125I episcleral plaque brachytherapy, with preservation of a functionally useful eye in many patients. The excellent results in the eye melanoma patients treated with external beam proton therapy also demonstrate that almost all the patients can successfully cooperate in their treatment by voluntarily fixating the eye on a particular point during treatment, so that their tumor is positioned properly in the beam during treatment. Conservative treatment can achieve local control rates similar to or superior to those achieved with radiation therapy alone in other commonly treated solid tumors, including early stage carcinomas of the breast, vocal cord, and prostate. Continued careful follow-up of conservatively treated patients will provide even better understanding of the radiation effects on uveal melanomas and on normal ocular structures.

METHODS: Between November 1992 and August 2000, 88 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory with proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery in which two to four convergent fixed beams of 160-MeV protons were applied. The median transverse diameter was 16 mm (range, 2.5-35 mm), and the median tumor volume was 1.4 cm(3) (range, 0.1-15.9 cm(3)). Surgical resection had been performed previously in 15 patients (17%). Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann Grade 1) and trigeminal nerve function were normal in 79 patients (89.8%). Eight patients (9%) had good or excellent hearing (Gardner-Robertson [GR] Grade 1), and 13 patients (15%) had serviceable hearing (GR Grade 2). A median dose of 12 cobalt Gray equivalents (range, 10-18 cobalt Gray equivalents) was prescribed to the 70 to 108% isodose lines (median, 70%). The median follow-up period was 38.7 months (range, 12-102.6 mo). RESULTS: The actuarial 2- and 5-year tumor control rates were 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.9-99.9%) and 93.6% (95% CI, 88.3-99.3%). Salvage radiosurgery was performed in one patient 32.5 months after treatment, and a craniotomy was required 19.1 months after treatment in another patient with hemorrhage in the vicinity of a stable tumor. Three patients (3.4%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus, and a subsequent partial resection was performed in one of these patients. The actuarial 5-year cumulative radiological reduction rate was 94.7% (95% CI, 81.2-98.3%). Of the 21 patients (24%) with functional hearing (GR Grade 1 or 2), 7 (33.3%) retained serviceable hearing ability (GR Grade 2). Actuarial 5-year normal facial and trigeminal nerve function preservation rates were 91.1% (95% CI, 85-97.6%) and 89.4% (95% CI, 82-96.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that prescribed dose (P = 0.005), maximum dose (P = 0.006), and the inhomogeneity coefficient (P = 0.03) were associated with a significant risk of long-term facial neuropathy. No other cranial nerve deficits or cancer relapses were observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery has been shown to be an effective means of tumor control. A high radiological response rate was observed. Excellent facial and trigeminal nerve function preservation rates were achieved. A reduced prescribed dose is associated with a significant decrease in facial neuropathy

We have experimentally investigated the intra-fractional organ motion effects in lung IMRT treatments delivered by multi-leaf collimator (MLC). An in-house made motor-driven platform, which moves sinusoidally with an amplitude of 1 cm and a period of 4 s, was used to mimic tumour motion. Tumour motion was simulated along cranial-caudal direction while MLC leaves moved across the patient from left to right, as in most clinical cases. The dose to a point near the centre of the tumour mass was measured according to geometric and dosimetric parameters from two five-field lung IMRT plans. For each field, measurement was done for two dose rates (300 and 500 MU min(-1)), three MLC delivery modes (sliding window, step-and-shoot with 10 and 20 intensity levels) and eight equally spaced starting phases of tumour motion. The dose to the measurement point delivered from all five fields was derived for both a single fraction and 30 fractions by randomly sampling from measured dose values of each field at different initial phases. It was found that the mean dose to a moving tumour differs slightly (<2-3%) from that to a static tumour. The variation in breathing phase at the start of dose delivery results in a maximum variation around the mean dose of greater than 30% for one field. The full width at half maximum for the probability distribution of the point dose is up to 8% for all five fields in a single fraction, but less than 1-2% after 30 fractions. In general, lower dose rate can reduce the motion-caused dose variation and therefore might be preferable for lung IMRT when no motion mitigation techniques are used. From the two IMRT cases we studied where tumour motion is perpendicular to MLC leaf motion, the dose variation was found to be insensitive to the MLC delivery mode

In this work we investigate the dose at the surface of a water phantom and at a depth of 0.007 cm, the practical reference depth for skin as recommended by ICRP and ICRU, with ultra-thin TLDs and Monte Carlo calculations. The calculations and measurements were carried out for fields ranging from 5 x 5 cm2 to 20 x 20 cm2 for 6 MV, 10 MV and 18 MV photon beams. The variation of the surface dose with angle of incidence and field size was investigated. Also, the exit dose was computed and measured for the same fields and angles of incidence. The dose at the ICRU reference depth was computed. Good agreement (+/-5%) was achieved between measurements and calculations. The surface dose at the entrance increased with the angle of incidence and/or the field size. The exit dose decreased with the angle of incidence but it increased with field size. The dose at the surface of the patient is mostly dependent on the beam energy, modality and beam obliquity rather than the field size and field separation. By correlating TLD measurements with Monte Carlo calculations, we were able to predict the dose at the skin surface with good accuracy. Knowing the dose received at the surface of the patient can lead to prediction of skin reactions helping with the design of new treatment techniques and alternative dose fractionation schemes

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

1	410	The effect of beam energy on the quality of IMRT plans for prostate conformal radiotherapy.[see comment]	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Neutrons, Photons, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Protons, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography Scanners,X-Ray Computed	Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) for prostate cancer is most commonly delivered with high-energy photons, typically in the range of 10-21 MV. With the advent of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), an increase in the number of monitor units (MU) relative to 3DCRT has lead to a concern about secondary malignancies. This risk becomes more relevant at higher photon energies where there is a greater neutron contribution. Subsequently, the majority of IMRT prostate treatments being delivered today are with 6-10 MV photons where neutron production is negligible. However, the absolute risk is small [Hall, E. J. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, Protons, and the Risk of Second Cancers. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 65, 1-7 (2006); Kry, F. S., Salehpour, M., Followill, D. S., Stovall, M., Kuban, D. A., White, R. A., and Rosen, I. I. The Calculated Risk of Fatal Secondary Malignancies From Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 62, 1195-1203 (2005).] and therefore it has been suggested that the use of an 18MV IMRT may achieve better target coverage and normal tissue sparing such that this benefit outweighs the risks. This paper investigates whether 18MV IMRT offer better target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Computed Tomography (CT) image sets of ten prostate cancer patients were acquired and two separate IMRT plans were created for each patient. One plan used 6 MV beams, and the other used 18 MV, both in a coplanar, non-opposed beam geometry. Beam arrangements and optimization constraints were the same for all plans. This work includes a comparison and discussion of the total integral dose, neutron dose conformity index, and total number of MU for plans generated with both energies

Our aim in this study was to identify lactate and lipids by varying the echo time (TE). We expect that the accurate detection of lactate and lipids will have high diagnostic value in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Following our protocol, we obtained meaningful 1HMRS spectra from 213 patients, including 163 patients with brain tumors, between August 1999 and February 2004. 1HMRS was performed with a TE of 144 ms followed by a TE of 30 ms and/or a TE of 288 ms, if necessary. For the 213 patients, lactate level was "negative" in 47 patients, "positive" in 131 patients, and "strongly positive" in 35 patients. The lipid level was "negative" in 90 patients, "positive" in 56 patients, and "strongly positive" in 67 patients. Based on logistic discriminant analyses of neuro-epithelial tumor WHO grade and lactate and lipid levels, lactate and lipid levels were significant between WHO grades 2 and 3 (P=0.0239) and between grades 3 and 4 (P=0.0347). Lipids are a more significant factor for the discrimination between WHO grades 2 and 3 (P=0.0073) and between grades 3 and 4 (P=0.0048). With our method of varying the TE, it is possible accurately and efficiently to detect lactate and lipids in the brain.

Our aim in this study was to identify lactate and lipids by varying the echo time (TE). We expect that the accurate detection of lactate and lipids will have high diagnostic value in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Following our protocol, we obtained meaningful 1HMRS spectra from 213 patients, including 163 patients with brain tumors, between August 1999 and February 2004. 1HMRS was performed with a TE of 144 ms followed by a TE of 30 ms and/or a TE of 288 ms, if necessary. For the 213 patients, lactate level was "negative" in 47 patients, "positive" in 131 patients, and "strongly positive" in 35 patients. The lipid level was "negative" in 90 patients, "positive" in 56 patients, and "strongly positive" in 67 patients. Based on logistic discriminant analyses of neuro-epithelial tumor WHO grade and lactate and lipid levels, lactate and lipid levels were significant between WHO grades 2 and 3 (P=0.0239) and between grades 3 and 4 (P=0.0347).

[Russian]	Adult, Eye, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	This paper presents the effects of proton beam therapy of 175 patients with tumors of the eye. Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation

Only 2% of 99 patients with small tumors and 4% of 566 patients with intermediate size tumors underwent enucleation after treatment; 10% of 341 patients with large tumors lost the treated eye. No eyes were removed after 52 months, with 89% of enucleations performed during the first 36 months after treatment.

Significantly greater enucleation rates were observed in patients with large tumors than in those with intermediate tumors (p = less than .0001), in patients with tumor height greater than 8 mm relative to those with tumors less than or equal to 8 mm, p = (less than .0001), with tumor diameter greater than 16 mm compared to less than or equal to 16 mm, (p = less than .0001), and with tumor involvement of the ciliary body compared to involvement of the choroid only (p = less than .0001). Possible strategies to decrease the likelihood of enucleation in patients at apparently increased risk of losing the eye after conservative therapy, that is, those with large tumors involving the ciliary body, might include a lower total dose, a more protracted treatment course, or a lower radiation dose and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with hyperthermia, or with other radiation sensitizers

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 17-year-old male patient underwent corpus callosotomy conformal SRS using a dedicated linear accelerator (linac) with dynamic arcs technique. The prescribed dose was 36.0 Gy at the periphery of the rostrum, genu, and a half of the body of the corpus callosum (CCA). At 8 months after conformal SRS, the patient developed a significant brain edema and moderate transitory motor deficit, which were controlled with steroids. After 32 months follow-up, there is an improvement of 84% on drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal SRS for corpus callosotomy with a single isocenter reproduce the results reported on literature using Gamma Knife-based SRS. The results show that this technique is safe and demonstrate its efficacy to control seizures

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) plans were designed for nine patients using the CORVUS treatment planning system (NOMOS Corp.). These plans were delivered using a tertiary collimator dedicated for serial tomotherapy attached to a 10-MV linear accelerator. For each patient, one optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) was placed on the sternum and one on the lower abdomen. The OSLDs were then processed, thereby estimating the in vivo absorbed doses to the sternum and gonads as a function of distance from the treatment site. RESULTS: The OSLDs were shown to measure known doses to within 5%, thereby validating their accuracy for this dose and energy range. In the patient studies, the dose received by the OSLDs varied in direct proportion to the number of monitor units delivered and inversely with the distance from the target volume; the patient dose at a distance of 15 cm from the target is approximately 0.4% of the total monitor units delivered, and drops to below 0.1% of the total MUs at approximately 40 cm from the center of the target. The average sternal dose was 1353 mSv and the average abdominal dose was 327 mSv for an average prescribed dose of 60.1 Gy. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the inefficient treatment delivery that on average required 9.9 MU/0.01 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: While IMRT reduces the normal tissue volume in the high-dose region, it also increases the overall monitor units delivered, and hence the whole-body dose, when compared with conventional treatment delivery. As has been noted in existing literature, these increases in whole-body dose from radiotherapy delivery may increase the likelihood of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of secondary malignancies from IMRT delivery, and compare this relative risk against the potential benefits of decreased normal tissue complication probabilities

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated

1	4558	TPD-based evaluation of near threshold mono-energetic proton energies for the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be production of neutrons for BNCT	Beryllium, Body Burden, Boron, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy/mt [Methods], Computer Simulation, Differential Threshold, Engineering, Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Models,Biological, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Time, Universities	An evaluation of mono-energetic proton energies ranging from 1.885 MeV to 1.920 MeV was carried out to determine the viability of these near threshold energies in producing neutrons for BNCT via the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction. Neutron fields generated at these proton energies were assessed using the treatable protocol depth (TPD) and the maximum TPD (TPD(max)) as evaluation indices. The heavy charged particle (HCP) dose rate to tumour was likewise applied as a figure of merit in order to account for irradiation time and required proton current. Incident proton energies closer to the reaction threshold generated deeper TPDs compared to higher energy protons when no boron dose enhancers (BDE) were placed in the irradiation field. Introducing a BDE resulted in improved TPDs for high proton energies but their achievable TPD(max) were comparatively lower than that obtained for lower proton energies. In terms of the HCP dose rate to tumour, higher proton energies generated neutron fields that yielded higher dose rates both at TPD(max) and at fixed depths of comparison. This infers that higher currents are required to deliver the prescribed treatment dose to tumours for proton beams with energies closer to the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction threshold and more achievable proton currents of around 10 mA or less for proton energies from 1.900 MeV and above. The dependence on incident proton energy of the TPD, TPD(max) and the HCP dose rate to tumour with respect to the (10)B concentration in tumour and healthy tissues were also clarified in this study. Increasing the (10)B concentration in tumour while maintaining a constant T/N ratio resulted in deeper TPD(max) where a greater change in TPD(max) was obtained for proton energies closer to the (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be reaction threshold. The HCP dose rates to tumour for all proton energies also went up, with the higher proton energies benefiting more from the increased (10)B concentration

According to the Borrmann classification based on X ray findings, Type 1 was found in 3 patients, Type 2 in 5, Type 3 in 40, and Type 4 in 15. Twelve patients could not be classified. The histological type was papillary adenocarcinoma in 7 patients, tubular adenocarcinoma in 23, mucinous carcinoma in 6, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in 14, signet ring cell carcinoma in 12 and others in 13. The site of remote metastasis in 19 patients was Virchow's lymph node in 8 patients, Douglas pouch in 3, liver and lung in 2 each and others in 4. All patients were treated by a either telecobalt 60 unit or a linear accelerator using 6 Mv photon and the total dose to primary lesion was 4000 cGy in 5 weeks to 7000 cGy in 8-9 weeks. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 6 patients or 8.0%, partial response (PR) in 46 or 61.3%, and no change (NC) in 23 or 30.7%. The response rate based on the sum of CR and PR was about 70%. The 50% survival period in months was 26.5, 7.3, and 3.2, respectively for patients with CR, PR, and NC. For the response of advanced gastric cancer to chemotherapy in the National Cancer Center Hospital, the combined use of UFT and Mitomycin C gave the highest rate, 46%. As for as local response is concerned, the response rate to radiation was 70%, a better result than that of chemotherapy alone

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

Rates of change in tumor height were computed for each patient using follow-up ultrasonographic measures during the first 2 years after treatment. Risk of metastasis was evaluated separately in the first 2 years after treatment when tumor decline was assessed (concurrent metastasis), and 2 years or later after treatment (subsequent metastasis). Using Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for other known risk factors, tumors regressing rapidly were significantly more likely to metastasize concurrently with their regression (P less than 0.05). The opposite was found for subsequent metastasis: tumors with a slow annual decline were more likely to metastasize after 2 years after treatment (P less than 0.05). Substantial changes also were noted in the ability of previously described prognostic factors (largest tumor diameter, tumor height, ciliary body involvement, and patient's age) to predict early and late metastasis. Characteristics placing individuals at high risk of metastasis may change markedly with time after treatment

However, the postoperative complication rate was higher in the radiotherapy group (51.9 +/- 6.9%) than in the surgery alone group (39.4 +/- 6.0%) mainly due to increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders in patient older than 55 years of age suffering heart pathology. Radiation treatment assured a higher 5-year survival rate (32.0 +/- 9.2% as compared to 14.2 +/- 5.7%) in squamous-cell lung cancer.

Radiation therapy has been used for patients who cannot be operated on for medical reasons or who have a tumor that is technically difficult to resect or that cannot be resected because of its location. We performed the present study to evaluate the efficacy of megavoltage radiation in terms of lack of tumor progression and treatment-related morbidity. METHODS: Twenty patients who had giant-cell tumor of bone were managed with a single course of megavoltage radiation (forty to seventy gray administered at 1.8 to 2.0 gray per fraction with an average total duration of treatment of five to seven weeks) between March 1973 and March 1992. We used megavoltage photons, 160-megaelectron-volt proton beams, or a combination of the two. RESULTS: After a median duration of follow-up of 9.3 years, the tumor had not progressed in seventeen of the twenty patients. Thus, the actuarial ten-year rate for lack of progression was 85 percent. Local regrowth was evident in one patient who had received radiation alone and in two of the thirteen patients who had been managed with partial resection and radiation. Operative treatment was successful in the three patients in whom the radiation treatment had failed. No radiation-induced tumors were observed in our series. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that giant-cell tumor of bone was effectively treated with megavoltage radiation in our series of twenty patients in whom operative resection would have been difficult or was not feasible. The rate of tumors that did not progress with this regimen of radiation is similar to that reported by investigators from several other centers. Furthermore, these results closely rival those obtained with modern curettage procedures. Malignant sarcomatous transformation was not observed in our series. A longer duration of follow-up of a larger group of patients is necessary to provide a better estimate of the risk of malignant transformation

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation.

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation.

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordomas is a challenge. In this study the authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordomas and 10 patients with chondrosarcomas. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact, log rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%. respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordomas) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam therapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively, at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with the worst RFS rates compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively, at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy followed by those with cerebrospinal fluid leakages were the most frequent postoperative complications. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and patient age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam therapy provided better prognoses for these patients

1	224	Intraoperative radiotherapy in the conventional linear accelerator room for early breast cancer treatment: an alternative choice in developing countries	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brazil, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Developing Countries, Electrons, Female, Fibrosis, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Recurrence	Intraoperative radiotherapy with a single dose of electrons (ELIOT) in the conservative treatment of breast cancer is a possibility under evaluation in clinical trials. The costs of the mobile linear accelerator with a robotic arm, used in intraoperative radiotherapy, are prohibitive for poor countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ELIOT in the accelerator room of the Radiotherapy Service for early breast cancer treatment. We analyzed 40 patients submitted to breast conservative surgery and ELIOT, in the accelerator room of the Radiotherapy Service at the Hospital of Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil from January 2004 to July 2005. Patients with unifocal breast carcinoma smaller than 25 mm, aged over 45 years, who were candidates for conservative surgery were selected and a total dose of 21Gy was delivered, without further radiotherapy. In the short-term follow-up (median 18 months), six patients (15%) presented with some grade of fibrosis under the scar. One case (2.5%) of local recurrence was reported. There are no cases of contralateral carcinoma or distant metastases so far. Our data show that intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons can be safely performed in an accelerator room with a conventional machine

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

1	2750	The risk of enucleation after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma	Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Retinal Detachment/et [Etiology], Risk, Risk Factors, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision	Enucleation after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas occurred in 64 (6.4%) of 994 eyes with a median follow-up time of 2.7 years. The median time between irradiation and enucleation in the 64 enucleated eyes was 13 months. The probability of retaining the eye was 95 and 90%, 2 and 5 years postirradiation, respectively. Three percent of eyes were enucleated during posttreatment year 1, and the yearly rate was 1% by the fourth year. No patient had enucleation later than 5 1/2 years posttreatment. The complication most likely to result in enucleation was neovascular glaucoma although this was frequently managed without enucleation. Other common reasons for enucleation were documented or suspected tumor growth and complete retinal detachment with associated loss of vision. The leading risk factors for enucleation were anterior tumor margin involving the ciliary body, tumor height greater than 8 mm, and proximity of the tumor to the fovea. Based on the presence or absence of these factors, 5-year eye retention rates were 99, 92, and 76% for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Thus, the probability of eye retention after proton beam irradiation is high even among those at greatest risk of enucleation	
1	1475	Concomitant diminishing magnetization-transfer effect and increasing choline level in radiation-induced temporal-lobe changes	Choline/me [Metabolism], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Research, Temporal Lobe/re [Radiation Effects]	This article reports on the use of both magnetization-transfer (MT) imaging and 1H-MR spectroscopy in two cases of bilateral temporal-lobe changes after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the first case, the following patterns were noted: (i) although the temporal lobes appeared relatively normal on T2-weighted MR imaging, corresponding MT imaging clearly showed signal abnormalities (decreased MT effect) consistent with alterations in macromolecular structure; and (ii) concomitant strongly elevated choline on 1H-MR spectroscopy was observed, and this is associated with metabolic changes in cell membranes. The second case presented similar characteristics. In addition, there was an increased lactate signal and T2 signal changes in keeping with established oedema. Both MT and proton-spectroscopic findings were consistent with postulated pathophysiological features of radiation injury, but their specificity for this condition remains unclear. Magnetization-transfer imaging, and possibly 1H-MR spectroscopy, might be sensitive techniques for the early detection of late radiation injury

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1994 to March 2000, 163 patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Analysis was performed on 54 optic nerves (ONs) corresponding to 30 patients whose ONs had been included in the irradiated volume. These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of >4 years. All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before treatment. We evaluated the dose-complication probability and the prognostic factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon ion radiotherapy, using dose-volume histograms and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age of 30 patients (14 men, 16 women) was 57.2 years. Median prescribed total dose was 56.0 gray equivalents (GyE) at 3.0-4.0 GyE per fraction per day (range, 48-64 GyE; 16-18 fractions; 4-6 weeks). Of 54 ONs that were analyzed, 35 had been irradiated with <57 GyE (maximum dose [Dmax]) resulting in no visual loss. Conversely, 11 of the 19 ONs (58%) irradiated with >57 GyE (Dmax) suffered a decrease of visual acuity. In all of these cases, the ONs had been involved in the tumor before carbon ion radiotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, a dose of 20% of the volume of the ON (D20) was significantly associated with visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of visual loss seems to be correlated with a delivery of >60 GyE to 20% of the volume of the ON

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1994 to March 2000, 163 patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Analysis was performed on 54 optic nerves (ONs) corresponding to 30 patients whose ONs had been included in the irradiated volume. These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of >4 years. All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before treatment. We evaluated the dose-complication probability and the prognostic factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon ion radiotherapy, using dose-volume histograms and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age of 30 patients (14 men, 16 women) was 57.2 years.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing

One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem.

Optimal treatment for patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate is controversial. Radiation therapy is an established modality in the management of these patients, and several reports indicate the results are comparable to those achieved with radical prostatectomy. Recently effectiveness of therapy for carcinoma of the prostate is being evaluated in light of post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determinations. METHODS. A review was performed of multiple publications and data from selected institutions with large experience in the management of carcinoma of the prostate. Survival and clinical incidence of local recurrence and distant metastases were analyzed as well as preliminary data on postirradiation PSA levels. Factors that affect the outcome of therapy and relevant clinical trials are discussed. RESULTS. Reported differences in the age of patients treated with radical prostatectomy (59-63 years), irradiation (63-69 years), or observation (69-75.5 years) were identified. The effect of surgical staging on outcome of irradiation was significant. In multiple series of patients clinically and radiographically staged, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) with external irradiation was 95-100% for clinical stage T1a, 80-90% for Stage T1b,c, and 50-70% for clinical Stage T3. A correlation has been identified between the initial PSA levels and the probability from freedom of chemical failure (PSA elevation) after definitive irradiation. In five series comprising 814 patients with Stage T1c and T2 tumors, the DFS (end point chemical failure) was 95%, with initial PSA of less than 4 ng/ml, 83-92% with 4.1-10 ng/ml, 35-85% with 10.1-20 ng/ml, and 10-63% with PSA higher than 20 ng/ml. In the various series, follow-up ranged from a median of 1.5 years to a minimum of 4 years. In two series of 225 and 201 patients receiving doses of 7500-8000 cGy, less morbidity has been observed with three-dimensional treatment planning conformal radiation therapy than with conventional irradiation. New directions for future clinical trials are discussed, including dose escalation studies; use of high linear energy transfer to improve locoregional tumor control; and combination of irradiation and androgen suppression to enhance local tumor control, decrease distant metastasis, and improve survival. Preliminary results of a randomized study recently reported by RTOG strongly suggest that the use of goserelin acetate and flutamide decreases the incidence of clinical local recurrence (12.4% in 225 patients) compared with a control group treated with irradiation alone (25.2% in 230 patients) and enhances disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS. Although modern approaches to the management of patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate with irradiation are effective, investigators must continue to critically assess policies of treatment, develop appropriately designed prospective clinical trials, and define the optimal management of patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate.

Ten patients were irradiated after a radical thymectomy, three after partial resection and eleven after histologic diagnosis alone The patients were treated by different irradiation methods, mostly with the photons of a Co60 unit and a 43 MeV betatron. The average focal dose was 45 Gy which were administered within five weeks. The observation period was five years on an average. The general five year survival probability was 54%; some partial collectives were evaluated individually. These studies show that by unique radiotherapy, too, a two-year survival rate of 100% and a five-year survival rate of 50% as sell as a local recurrence rate of about 20% can be reached. Patients under fourty years with epithelial thymomas and a dose of less than 40 Gy have a less favorable prognosis. Compared to other authors, a relatively high rate of remote metastases was observed which necessitated extensive follow-up measures and suggests an adjuvant chemotherapy

However, it is difficult to evaluate its effect in certain cases. Recently, it has been reported that the usage of contrast-enhanced color Doppler ultrasonography (CECDU) can improve diagnostic accuracy, both in terms of the presence of hepatic tumor and in the evaluation of treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of CECDU in assessing the therapeutic response of HCC treated with proton radiotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-two patients treated with the proton radiotherapy were studied. We inspected HCC lesions by CECDU, before and after the irradiation, over time. The magnitude of blood flow in the HCC was quantified on still images by CECDU. The ratio of the number of color pixels against that of the total number of pixels in the tumor area was defined as the tumor blood flow ratio (TBFR). RESULTS: Immediately after the proton treatment, a transient increase of blood flow in the tumor was recognized in more than half of the patients, while the TBFR was unchanged or decreased in the remaining patients. At longer periods after irradiation, the TBFR in all HCCs gradually decreased, and this reduction of TBFR was statistically significant from 9 months after irradiation. These findings are consistent with those obtained previously by computed tomography (CT) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CONCLUSIONS: We propose CECDU as a useful diagnostic option for the evaluation of HCC treated with proton radiotherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1968 and 1985, 1624 patients were treated for clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer. The study population was limited to 1380 patients who underwent complete gross excision and received greater than or equal to 60 Gy to the tumor bed. Of these, 1125 were treated on a 4 MV, 153 on a 6 MV, and 102 on an 8 MV linear accelerator. Patients were selected for treatment on the 8 MV machine based on chest wall separations greater than 24 cm. Of patients treated on the 8 MV, netting was used for 42% and bolus was used for 26%. The median dose with bolus was 14 Gy in seven fractions (range: 2-34.2 Gy). Patients treated on the 8 MV accelerator were older, had a higher percentage of clinical T2 tumors, a higher percentage of pathologically positive nodes, and a lower incidence of extensive intraductal component (EIC). Median follow-up times were 130, 153, and 102 months, respectively, for survivors treated on the 4, 6, and 8 MV machines. RESULTS: We analyzed the site and 5-year crude incidence of first failure by machine energy and found the pattern of first failure site (local, nodal, or distant) to be virtually identical for each energy group. Of the local failures, 12 were in the skin of the treated breast, and these failures were evenly distributed by machine energy. We performed a multivariate analysis to adjust for factors known to predict for treatment failure. When adjusted for these other variables, machine energy was not associated with an increased (or decreased) risk of recurrence (RR for 8 MV vs. 4 MV = 0.94, p = 0.7; RR for 6 MV vs. 4 MV = 1.0, p = 0.9). We also analyzed the nature and incidence of treatment complications (rib fracture, radiation pneumonitis, soft tissue necrosis, and brachial plexopathy) and found no significant differences among the three treatment groups when stratified by treatment technique (tangents only vs. three-field). There was also no significant difference in cosmetic outcome at 5 years among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that machine energy over the range of 4 to 8 MV does not significantly affect treatment outcome. Specifically, it was feasible to treat patients with large chest wall separations using an 8 MV machine without an increase in skin recurrences and with the improved dose homogeneity afforded by 8 MV machines as compared with those of lower energies

Protons administer a uniform dose across the target and then virtually zero deep to the target and lower dose proximal to the target (for non-superficial lesions). The result is a smaller treatment volume, and therefore a lower incidence and frequency of treatment-related morbidity. Moreover, the reduction in treatment volume permits a higher dose to the tumor. This means an improved local control probability and lower normal tissue complication probability. Evidence-based medicine has demonstrated that clinical gains have been realized in the treatment of patient with uveal melanoma, skull-base or spinal sarcoma and prostate cancer. In the future, more extensive prospective studies are required to assess more completely the potential clinical benefit of proton beam therapy in many anatomical sites in children and adults.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications.

Such prostate movements are problematic for intensity-modulated radiotherapy, with its associated tight margins and dose escalation. Because of these intrinsic daily uncertainties, a relative generous "margin" is necessary to avoid marginal misses. Using the CT-linear accelerator combination in the treatment suite (Primatom, Siemens), we found that the daily intrinsic prostate movements can be easily corrected before each radiotherapy session. Dosimetric calculations were performed to evaluate the amount of discrepancy of dose to the target if no correction was done for prostate movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Primatom consists of a Siemens Somatom CT scanner and a Siemens Primus linear accelerator installed in the same treatment suite and sharing a common table/couch. The patient is scanned by the CT scanner, which is movable on a pair of horizontal rails. During scanning, the couch does not move. The exact location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and rectum are identified and localized. These positions are then compared with the planned positions. The daily movement of the prostate and rectum were corrected for and a new isocenter derived. The patient was treated immediately using the new isocenter. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients with primary prostate cancer studied, 540 consecutive daily CT scans were performed during the last part of the cone down treatment. Of the 540 scans, 46% required no isocenter adjustments for the AP-PA direction, 54% required a shift of > or =3 mm, 44% required a shift of >5 mm, and 15% required a shift of >10 mm. In the superoinferior direction, 27% required a shift of >3 mm, 25% required a shift of >5 mm, and 4% required a shift of >10 mm. In the right-left direction, 34% required a shift of >3 mm, 24% required a shift of >5 mm, and 5% required a shift of >10 mm. Dosimetric calculations for a typical case of prostate cancer using intensity-modulated radiotherapy with 5-mm margin coverage from the clinical target volume (prostate gland) was performed. With a posterior shift of 10 mm for the prostate, the dose coverage dropped from 95-107% to 71-100% coverage. CONCLUSION: We have described a technique that corrects for the daily prostate motion, allowing for extremely precise prostate cancer treatment. This technique has significant implications for dose escalation and for decreasing rectal complications in the treatment of prostate cancer	
0	3935	A precision cranial immobilization system for conformal stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy	Boston, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Equipment Design, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Massachusetts, Methods, Motion, Movement, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Rotation, Stereotaxic Techniques	PURPOSE: Conformal radiotherapy has been shown to benefit from precision alignment of patient target to therapy beam (1, 6, 13). This work describes an optimized immobilization system for the fractionated treatment of intracranial targets. A study of patient motion demonstrates the high degree of immobilization which is available. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system using dental fixation and a thermoplastic mask that relocates on a rigid frame is described. The design permits scanning studies using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR), conventional photon radiotherapy, and high precision stereotactic proton radiotherapy to be performed with minimal repositioning variation. Studies of both intratreatment motion and daily setup reliability are performed on patients under treatment for paranasal sinus carcinoma. Multiple radiographs taken during single treatments provide the basis for a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis. Additionally, studies of orthogonal radiographs used to setup for proton treatments and verification port films from photon treatments are used to establish day to day patient position variation in routine use. RESULTS: Net 3D patient motion during any treatment is measured to be 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] and rotation about any body axis is 0.14 +/- 0.67 degrees (mean +/- SD). Day-to-day setup accuracy to laser marks is limited to 2.3 mm (mean) systematic error and 1.6 mm (mean) random error. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the most stringent immobilization requirements of 3D conformal radiotherapy adjacent to critical normal structures can be met with a high precision system such as the one described here. Without the use of pretreatment verification, additional developments in machine and couch design are needed to assure that patient repositioning accuracy is comparable to the best level of patient immobility achievable

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Thirty-two men (44 to 80 years old) with locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate (stage B2 or C) have been treated by 3D-planned conformal radiotherapy using high energy photons. In 28/32 men treatment technique was a monoaxial bisegmental rotation with irregular fields. With single doses of 2.0 Gy a mean total dose of 63.9 +/- 4.9 Gy according to ICRU was applied within 46 +/- 4 days. Maximum dose was in the mean 105.1% +/- 3.8%. 3D treatment volume was 274.1 +/- 113.4 cm3. Median follow-up is 1.8 years (15 to 34 months). Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC by patient interview and physical examination on a weekly basis during radiotherapy and by regular follow-up. RESULTS: Eleven patients had none, 15 mild (RTOG grade 1) and 6 moderate symptoms (RTOG grade 2, mainly diarrhoea, dysuria and polyuria). Acute complications leading to treatment interruption did not occur. In 16 patients symptoms disappeared within 6 weeks after radiotherapy. Only 2 men had symptoms which lasted longer than 3 months and were endoscopically examined. Up to now no late complications were detected. Incidence and severity of toxicity was significantly (p < 0.05) related to the size of treatment volume. Acute toxicity was found to depend statistically significant (p < 0.05) on the proportional volume of bladder and rectum, irradiated with more than 35 Gy. In 81% of the patients with pretherapeutic elevated PSA levels normalisation of PSA was observed. Overall mean PSA levels of 15.7 +/- 22.6 micrograms/l at the beginning of radiotherapy fell to 2.1 +/- 3.7 micrograms/l 6 weeks after irradiation. Only 1 Patient relapsed locally 22 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: We conclude that due to modern 3D-planned conformal techniques with optimization of treatment dose and improved protection of critical organs such as urinary bladder and rectum, radiotherapy allows an effective and well tolerated therapy of localized prostatic carcinoma

The theoretical considerations about the clinical advantages this treatment modality can yield and the results obtained at the centers where it has already been used justify the proposal to project a center of this kind also in our Country. To this purpose, two of the authors of this paper (U. Amaldi, G. Tosi) founded the TERA Group formed by physicists, engineers and radiotherapists who work in close collaboration on a feasibility study for a hadrontherapy facility. The first aim of the Hadrontherapy Project is to design a center equipped with a synchrotron which, at the beginning, will accelerate negative hydrogen ions (H-) which will first produce 70-250 MeV proton beams and, then accelerate light ions (up to 16O) to 430 MeV/amu. This accelerator will serve four or five treatment rooms where patients can be irradiated simultaneously. Two rooms will be equipped with a fixed horizontal beam for the treatment of eye, head and neck tumors; the others will be equipped with rotating gantries to administer, in any clinical situation, really adequate treatment. Such a unit, when enough experience is fained, will allow at least 1000 patients to be treated yearly. The synchrotron injector will be designed so as to allow, parallel to the radiotherapy activities, other applications of medical and biological interest such as: the production of radioisotopes for diagnostic use (especially positron emitters), the analysis of trace elements through the PIXE technique and the production of thermal and epithermal neutrons for boron neutron capture therapy.

This paper discusses the clinical results of chest wall treatment by electron arc therapy. Twenty-one patients were treated following mastectomy, 16 electively because of high risk for local failure, and 5 because of local recurrence. One patient with advanced local-regional disease was treated primarily. During a median follow-up period of 24 months there has been one chest failure in one of the patients treated for local recurrence. No major complications were observed in skin, lung, soft tissue or esophagus, even in the 7 patients recently or concomitantly treated with multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy. In 3 patients, small areas of telangiectasia developed in the region of abutment of the electron arc field to a photon field used to irradiate the supraclavicular nodal area. We conclude that the technique as applied to these patients is safe and efficacious. In certain clinical settings it has advantage over standard, fixed field approaches to treat the chest wall	
1	209	Proton MR spectroscopy of the prostate.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pertinent radiological and biochemical literature was searched and retrieved via electronic media (medline, pubmed. Basic concepts of MRS of the prostate and its clinical applications were extracted. RESULTS: Clinical MRS is usually based on point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) or spin echo (SE) sequences, along with outer volume suppression of signals from outside of the prostate. MRS of the prostate detects indicator lines of citrate, choline, and creatine. While healthy prostate tissue demonstrates high levels of citrate and low levels of choline that marks cell wall turnover, prostate cancer utilizes citrate for energy metabolism and shows high levels of choline. The ratio of (choline+creatine)/citrate distinguishes between healthy tissue and prostate cancer. Particularly when combined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, three-dimensional MRS imaging (3D-CSI, or 3D-MRSI) detects and localizes prostate cancer in the entire prostate with high sensitivity and specificity. Combined MR imaging and 3D-MRSI exceed the sensitivity and specificity of sextant biopsy of the prostate. When MRS and MR imaging agree on prostate cancer presence, the positive predictive value is about 80-90%. Distinction between healthy tissue and prostate cancer principally is maintained after various therapeutic treatments, including hormone ablation therapy, radiation therapy, and cryotherapy of the prostate. CONCLUSIONS: Since it is non-invasive, reliable, radiation-free, and essentially repeatable, combined MR imaging and 3D-MRSI of the prostate lends itself to the planning of biopsy and therapy, and to post-therapeutic follow-up. For broad clinical acceptance, it will be necessary to facilitate MRS examinations and their evaluation and make MRS available to a wider range of institutions. [References: 57]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was performed between the Hungarian radiotherapy centers in order to compare the dose prescription methods. Then, treatment plans of 125 breast cancer patients treated in our department were evaluated. The irradiations were performed with cobalt unit, and with 6 and 9 MV photon beams of linear accelerators. The dose distributions were normalized to izocenter, then dose values in five points in central plane; local medial, lateral and central maximums (D(med), D(lat) and D(cent)); volumetric maximum and its location were determined. To characterize the dose to lung and to heart at left-sided tumors the central lung distance (CLD) and maximum heart distance (MHD) were used. Based on the results, estimation was made to assess the differences between delivered dose due to various dose prescriptions applied at the institutions. RESULTS: Four types of dose prescription are currently used in our country, and most frequently the isocenter is selected as a reference point. In the central plane the calculated dose in all but one points differed only a little from the dose to isocenter. The mean D(med), D(lat) and D(cent) were 107%, 107% and 101%, respectively. The volumetric maximum was on average 13% higher than the dose to isocenter. Regarding the beam qualities, this value was 16%, 13% and 11% for cobalt unit, 6 MV and 9 MV photon beams, respectively. The mean CLD and MHD were 1.9 and 0.8 cm, respectively. The difference between delivered doses at the institutions was 6% on average, but in extreme cases it can be as high as 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional treatment planning and plan evaluation are recommended at breast irradiation, especially for large breasts. Since the various dose prescriptions may result in significant differences in the delivered doses, use of a standard dose prescription protocol is recommended

In the central plane the calculated dose in all but one points differed only a little from the dose to isocenter. The mean D(med), D(lat) and D(cent) were 107%, 107% and 101%, respectively. The volumetric maximum was on average 13% higher than the dose to isocenter. Regarding the beam qualities, this value was 16%, 13% and 11% for cobalt unit, 6 MV and 9 MV photon beams, respectively. The mean CLD and MHD were 1.9 and 0.8 cm, respectively. The difference between delivered doses at the institutions was 6% on average, but in extreme cases it can be as high as 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional treatment planning and plan evaluation are recommended at breast irradiation, especially for large breasts. Since the various dose prescriptions may result in significant differences in the delivered doses, use of a standard dose prescription protocol is recommended

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was performed between the Hungarian radiotherapy centers in order to compare the dose prescription methods. Then, treatment plans of 125 breast cancer patients treated in our department were evaluated. The irradiations were performed with cobalt unit, and with 6 and 9 MV photon beams of linear accelerators. The dose distributions were normalized to izocenter, then dose values in five points in central plane; local medial, lateral and central maximums (D(med), D(lat) and D(cent)); volumetric maximum and its location were determined. To characterize the dose to lung and to heart at left-sided tumors the central lung distance (CLD) and maximum heart distance (MHD) were used. Based on the results, estimation was made to assess the differences between delivered dose due to various dose prescriptions applied at the institutions. RESULTS: Four types of dose prescription are currently used in our country, and most frequently the isocenter is selected as a reference point. In the central plane the calculated dose in all but one points differed only a little from the dose to isocenter. The mean D(med), D(lat) and D(cent) were 107%, 107% and 101%, respectively.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79% and 60%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted

DESIGN: A prospective phase 2 clinical trial. SETTING: Loma Linda University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74%, and 72%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87% vs 49%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

Threshold values to indicate the probability of a progressive tumor were also calculated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with histologically proven gliomas showing a suspicious brain lesion in MRI after stereotactic radiotherapy were evaluated on a 1.5 Tesla unit (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using 2D proton MRSI (repetition time/echo time = 1500/135 msec, PRESS; voxel size 9 x 9 x 15 mm (3)). A total of 274 spectra were analyzed (92 voxel were localized within the suspicious brain lesion). Relative signal intensities Cho, Cr and NAA were measured and their ability to discern between PT and nPT was assessed using the linear discrimination method, logistic regression, and the cross-validation method. PT and nPT were differentiated between on the basis of clinical course and follow-up by MRI, CT and positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The Cho parameter and the relative signal intensity ratios of Cr and NAA were most effective in differentiating between PT and nPT. The logistic regression method using the parameter ln(Cho/Cr) and ln(Cho/NAA) had the best predictive results in cross-validation. A sensitivity of 93.8 % and specificity of 85.7 % were achieved in the differentiation of PT from nPT by proton-MRSI. CONCLUSION: (1)H-MRSI has a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between therapy-related effects and the relapse of irradiated gliomas. This method allows for assessment of the probability of radiotherapy response or failure

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight adult patients with chordoma of the sacrum (23), base of skull (20) or mobile spine (5), were seen between 1958-1992. Forty-four were referred post operatively with overt disease and 31 of these were irradiated with conventionally fractionated radiation to a median dose of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks (range 25-60 Gy). Eight received a hyperfractionation protocol of 1 Gy, 4 hourly, 4 times a day (median 40 Gy/44 fractions/14 days), two sacral patients were treated with a hypofractionation protocol and three cases with skull base tumours were referred elsewhere for proton therapy. Endpoints measured were survival from diagnosis, objective response rate, symptomatic response rate and clinical or radiological progression-free survival from radiotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival was 62 months (range 4-240 month) from diagnosis with no difference between clival and non-clival presentations. One complete and no partial responses were identified in 23 assessable patients. A subjective response was recorded for 12/14 (85%) with pain and 10/23 (45%) with neurological signs or symptoms, and the median time to progression for those with overt disease was 35 months (range 5-220 months). There was no survival advantage to patients receiving radiation doses > 50 Gy (median 60 Gy) compared to doses < 50 Gy (median 40 Gy). There was no difference between the conventional or hyperfractionation regimens with respect to the degree or duration of symptomatic response, or in progression-free survival. Fourteen patients who progressed after irradiation were retreated with surgery (6), irradiation (7) or both modalities (1). Median survival after retreatment was 18 months, and the only two symptomatic responses seen were with reirradiation, and after failure of relatively low dose initial therapy. At last follow-up, 35 were dead of or with disease, seven are alive with disease, and two are disease-free. Thirty-eight had local disease persistence as the sole site of failure, and four developed distant metastases initially or subsequently. DISCUSSION: Overt residual chordoma is rarely cured with conventional external beam irradiation, but treatment does provide useful and prolonged palliation of pain for most patients. Chordoma is a disease with low metastatic potential, and better local control may improve survival. Complete resection rates may be improved for patients with sacral disease by using planned excisions in centres experienced in treating this rare disease. Because radiation therapy may prove to be more successful in controlling microscopic disease, it should be considered as a pre- or postoperative adjuvant to a macroscopically complete resection. Patients with skull base disease should also be resected in centres specializing in this surgery, but complete excision is unlikely. These patients will not obtain local control with conventional photon irradiation, and suitable patients should be considered for irradiation with stereotactic photon or particle beam therapy. For patients who progress after irradiation, there is limited symptomatic benefit to retreatment with surgery or reirradiation, and this should be limited to treating life-threatening complications

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 42 patients with solitary lytic metastasis in weight-bearing bones were studied. Primary endpoints were the mean value and energy of gray-level histogram in plain radiographs (MVGLH and EGLH) and relative electron density (RED) of CT scans in bone lesions. In eleven patients (group A) the DP dose was increased stepwise from 90 up to 180 mg (flat dose), while in other 15 patients (group B) a flat dose of 180 mg was administered intravenously in 2 h. In both groups, the first session of DP was given concurrently with local radiotherapy (30 Gy in ten fractions, 5 days a week). Another 16 patients (group C) underwent radiotherapy only. RESULTS: Morbidity related to pamidronate was mild. Significant differences from the baseline (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) were recorded for MVGLH, EGLH and RED values, regarding all groups. Improvement was significantly higher in patients of group B versus A, while the results of pamidronate groups (A and B) were superior to group C, concerning the above indices (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, pamidronate groups had significantly lower skeletal morbidity than group C. CONCLUSION: The 2-h infusional flat dose of 180 mg every 4 weeks seems to be tolerable and superior to 90 mg regarding palliation and mainly recalcification of osteolytic lesions. Radiotherapy alone is effective but inferior to the combined treatment. Last but not least, the findings of MVGLH, EGLH and RED indicate an important increase in bone mass and bone formation, which was difficult to be identified visually by the experts

The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, base-of-skull sarcomas, low-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and para-nasal sinus tumors. In addition, we have treated bone sarcomas in the neck and trunk--mainly in the sacral area--as well as prostate cases and some soft tissue sarcomas. PTV volumes for our treated cases are in the range 20-4500 ml, indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating lesions of all types and sizes. The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of fluence modulated Bragg peaks delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 000. With the current delivery rate of roughly 3000 Bragg peaks per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to 20-25 min. Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about 10% of delivered spots have a weight of more than 10% of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for optimizing the number of spots delivered per field. Field specific dosimetry shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within +/-1 mm (1 SD) orthogonal to the field direction and to within 1.5 mm in range. With our current delivery system the mean widths of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 mm (sigma) for all energies, indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be made. In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg peaks shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg peaks over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of penetration. This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast re-scanning on second generation scanning gantries

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-nine patients were treated between April 1996 and September 2000. The median age was 56 years (range: 29-80), and median maximal tumor diameter was 20 mm (range: 9-40). A total of 11 patients had fifth and/or seventh cranial nerve dysfunction before irradiation; 2 patients had only facial weakness, 5 patients had only facial numbness, and 4 patients had both facial weakness and numbness. Thirty-three patients were treated with primary FSRT, and 6 patients were treated for recurrent or persistent disease after previous surgery. All patients were treated with 6-MV photons using a stereotactic system with a relocatable frame. The 39 patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Median follow-up was 21.8 months (range: 4.4-49.6). RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 37 patients (95%). Two patients experienced deterioration of their symptoms at 3 and 20 months as a result of clinical progression in one case and tumor progression in the other and underwent surgery post FSRT. A total of 19/28 (67.9%) patients preserved serviceable hearing after FSRT. Deterioration of the facial and trigeminal nerves was observed in only 2 patients who were treated with surgery post FSRT. CONCLUSION: FSRT provided excellent tumor control with minimal morbidity and good hearing preservation in this cohort of patients. Longer follow-up is required to confirm long-term control rates

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by radiation with a nonnegative margin < or =2 mm from January 1974 to September 2001. The median age was 61 years. Margins were positive in 29% and close (< or =2 mm) in 71%. The median dose was 64 to 66 Gy. The median follow up was 5.9 years. RESULTS: The number of resection margins close or positive was 1 in 73% of patients, 2 in 14%, 3 in 1%, and unknown in 12%. The margin location was 23% anterior, 24% posterior, 12% medial, 12% lateral, 17% superior, and 12% inferior. Reasons for not reexcising were advanced age/comorbidities in 7%, anterior location under skin in 25%, posterior location to muscle in 15%, focal involvement in 13%, no extensive intraductal component in 5%, surgeon refusal in 15%, and patient refusal in 20%. There was a strong association between an anterior or posterior margin location and the rationale of no additional breast tissue at the margin to reexcise before radiation. The risk of local recurrence at 5 and 10 years was 3% and 5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Further research of close and positive margins is needed to validate features identified in this series, particularly nonbreast tissue anatomic margins, that are associated with low risks of local recurrence after radiation

Heavy-ion therapy has been applied for various solid tumors including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Although the local control rate of carbon ion radiotherapy for esophageal cancer has revealed better rates than that of conventional radiotherapy, some patients have shown resistance to the treatment. No study has evaluated whether anti-cancer drugs can enhance the anti-tumor effect of heavy carbon-ion beam irradiation. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of docetaxel, fluorouracil, cisplatinum, doxorubicin and gemcitabine to enhance the anti-tumor effects of heavy carbon-ion beam irradiation on human esophageal SCC cells in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Fluorouracil, cisplatinum, doxorubicin and gemcitabine showed only additive anti-tumor effects. On the other hand, growth suppression was significantly potentiated by the combined treatment with heavy carbon-ion beam and docetaxel as compared to that treated with either agent alone. These data suggest that heavy carbon-ion beam irradiation combined with docetaxel may be a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for locally advanced esophageal SCC

This study was to investigate clinical value of submandibular salivary gland transfer in preventing radiation-induced xerostomia of NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 70 eligible patients with NPC were recruited, and divided into test group (36 patients) and control group (34 patients). In test group, the submandibular glands were transferred to the submental spaces before conventional radiotherapy. The submental spaces were shielded during radiotherapy. Oral cavity mucous membrane reaction during radiotherapy, submandibular gland function and salivary fluid before and after radiotherapy, and questionnaire of xerostomia 3 months after radiotherapy were compared between test group and control group. RESULTS: Acute oral cavity mucous membrane reaction was severer in control group than in test group; the incidence of stage III reaction was significantly higher in control group than in test group ( 8/34 vs. 3/36, P = 0.007). Three months after radiotherapy, trapping and excretion functions of the transferred submandibular glands were significantly better than those of the untransferred submandibular glands in test group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.000); trapping and excretion functions of the submandibular glands were significantly better in test group than in control group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.000). The mean weight of salivary fluid after radiotherapy was heavier in test group than in control group (1.41 g vs. 0.71 g). Incidence of moderate to severe degree of xerostomia was significantly higher in test group than in control group (76.5% vs. 13.9%, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Submandibular gland transfer may be used to prevent radiation-induced xerostomia of NPC patients, and may improve life quality of the patients

1	1897	Proton beam irradiation of subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation in age-related macular degeneration	Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Choroidal Neovascularization/et [Etiology], Choroidal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Incidence, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/co [Complications], Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Research, Safety, Time, Universities, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: To assess the safety and potential toxicity of proton beam radiation in the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) due to age-related manner degeneration (ARMD) in a prospective, non-randomised study. METHODS: Forty-eight eyes of 46 consecutive patients with subfoveal CNVM due to ARMD, not amenable to laser photocoagulation, were treated prospectively with a single proton beam exposure. Two dose regimens were evaluated: 8 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) and 14 CGE. Patients were followed for an average of 22.1 months after proton beam treatment. RESULTS: At the 12 month follow-up, 44% of eyes in the 8 CGE group and 75% of the eyes in the 14 CGE group had stabilized or improved visual acuity. Complex size in the 8 CGE group as measured on standard fluorescein angiography (FA), decreased or had no change initially but showed less effect over time, while the eyes treated with 14 CGE maintained decreased leakage over the follow-up period of 12 months. However, 11 eyes in the 14 CGE group experienced radiation retinopathy, with the onset between 3 and 30 months. Seven of these 11 eyes have demonstrated some visual loss but only 1 eye developed severe visual loss at 15 months after proton treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To date, 14 CGE has suggested a favourable influence on visual function and growth inhibition of CNVM. Proton beam irradiation appears to inhibit CNVM growth. The 14 CGE dose regimen appears to have a longer effect of CNVM growth than does 8 CGE, with overall stabilisation of visual function and growth inhibition. Radiation retinopathy has developed over time, but severe visual loss has been limited. On the basis of the incidence of radiation retinopathy, adjustments in the total radiation dosage and/or fractionation of the dosage should be considered	
1	1562	An optimization algorithm that incorporates IMRT delivery constraints	Algorithms, Head, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Research, Risk	An intensity-modulated beam optimization algorithm is presented which incorporates the delivery constraints into the optimization cycle. The optimization algorithm is based on the quasi-Newton method of iteratively solving minimization problems. The developed algorithm iteratively corrects the incident, pencil-beam-like, fluence to incorporate the delivery constraints. In the present study, the goal of the optimization algorithm is to achieve the best deliverable radiotherapy plan, subject to the constraints of the delivery technique described by a leaf-sequencing algorithm being applied concurrently. In general, if they are applied after, rather than during, the optimization cycle, the delivery constraints associated with the IMRT technique can produce local variations up to 6% in the 'optimized' dose (i.e., distribution without applied constraints) and reduce the degree of conformity, of the dose, to the PTV region. The optimization method has been applied to three IMRT delivery techniques: dynamic multileaf (DMLC), multiple-static-field (MSF) and slice-by-slice tomotherapy (NOMOS MIMiC). The beam profiles were generated for a prostate tumour with organs at risk being the rectum, bladder and femoral heads. The optimization method described was shown to generate optimum and deliverable IMRT plans for these three delivery techniques. In the case of the DMLC and MSF the optimization converged within 3-5 iterations to a mean PTV dose of 69.60 +/- 1.34 Gy and 69.71 +/- 1.34 Gy, respectively, while for NOMOS MIMiC approximately 10 iterations were needed to obtain 69.68 +/- 1.55 Gy. In addition to this, the IMRT optimization also yielded optimum fluence profiles when clustering was performed concurrently with the leaf-sequencer. An optimum between 8 and 15 clusters of equal fluence 'intensity' was shown to establish the best compromise between the number of fluence levels and the PTV dose coverage

CT consisted of two cycles of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2, by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days and cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on day 4 with mannitol-induced diuresis at 4-week intervals. Postoperatively, RT was administered when resection margins were minimal or if paraesophageal nodes were abnormal; the RT consisted of 5,000 to 5,400 cGy to the tumor area plus a 800- to 1,200-cGy boost to known abnormal tumor margins. Nineteen of 24 patients were resectable (79%). There was one SR death (5%). One of 22 had a normal barium swallow post-CT, no visible tumor at SR, and no pathologic evidence of any residual disease. There was complete radiologic and gross clinical disappearance of tumor post-CT or post-SR in ten of 22 patients (45%). Four of 22 (18%) had greater than or equal to 50% regression, and five of 22 (23%) had no response. Toxicity of CT was mild.

Following initial management of the first 464 patients, results were analyzed, as were results after a 1-year follow-up for 305 patients, a 2-year follow-up for 169 patients, and a 3-year follow-up for 59 patients. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the actuarial local recurrence rate was 5%, the 3-year survival rate 88%, and the overall metastasic rate 5%. The initial tumor volume was the most significant predictive factor for visual results and metastases. Multivariate analysis revealed that visual results were significantly related to the initial tumor volume, initial retinal detachment, and total dose delivered to the optic nerve and macula.

C-ion beams have a high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) resulting from the high linear energy transfer (LET). In terms of their physical characteristics, C-ion beams exhibit a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and make for a better dose distribution of the target volume by specified beam modulations. Between June 1994 and August 2005, a total of 2,371 patients with malignant tumors were registered in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II trials using C-ion beams generated at Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). In the initial dose-escalation studies, grade 3 or more late rectal complications had developed in some patients. However, the adverse effects were resolved because of the use of appropriate dose levels and modification of the radiation technique. C-ion beams can carry out hypofractionated radiotherapy with a large fraction dose and reduce the overall treatment times compared with conventional radiotherapy. They can also achieve better local tumor control even for radio-resistant tumors such as malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and bone and soft tissue sarcomas with minimal morbidity to the normal surrounding tissues.

METHODS: A contemporary series of patients managed with wide surgical excision, radiation therapy (three-dimensional conformal radiation, interstitial radiation, and charged-particle or proton therapy), and cryo-therapy were reviewed. RESULTS: We used preoperative cancer grade, transrectal ultrasound, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in all patients, and cross-sectional imaging and bone scans in selected patients to allow for reasonably accurate cancer staging and selection of patients most likely to be cured by radical prostatectomy or radiation. In patients with extracapsular extension of prostate cancer, wide surgical excision and achievement of a clear surgical margin had therapeutic value. Newer radiation techniques resulted in a higher likelihood of prostate cancer control than previous techniques. Cryotherapy for patients with stages T1 through 3 prostate cancer was associated with a posttreatment undetectable PSA rate of 48% and a positive biopsy rate of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with organ-confined and, therefore, curable prostate cancer can be identified. Well-performed radical prostatectomy, radiation, and cryotherapy are alternative treatments for the management of localized prostate cancer. [References: 64]	
1	1900	Proton radiation therapy (PRT) for pediatric optic pathway gliomas: comparison with 3D planned conventional photons and a standard photon technique	Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Optic Chiasm, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%, and 25% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (<20 cm3) and larger (> 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47% and 77% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11% and 16%) and pituitary gland (13% and 16%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39% and 54%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT. CONCLUSION: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues

Since November 1987, 26 patients with resectable gastric cancer were irradiated intraoperatively with the linear accelerator using fast electrons (single dose: 12 to 16 Gy). Percutaneous radiotherapy was performed postoperatively with 24 to 38 Gy (4 x 2 Gy per week). For intraoperative and percutaneous radiotherapy the target absorbed dose was selected in a way that their combined effect on the tumor was approximately equivalent to that of a total dose of 60 Gy in the usual fractionating. Up to now, the median survival time for stage III patients (UICC 1987) has been twelve months. In five patients who died of a relapse or of peritoneal carcinosis, histologic evaluation revealed in every case a diffuse tumor type according to Lauren-classification. All relapses occurred within the first eight months. The two-year survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier is 67% for stage III. Advanced resectable gastric cancer of the intestinal tumor type seems to profit from adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional CT sets for 10 lung cancer patients were used in this study. The internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) was obtained by combining the tumor volumes at different phases of the respiratory cycle. For each patient, we evaluated four planning strategies based on the following dose calculations: (1) the average (AVE) CT; (2) the free-breathing (FB) CT; (3) the maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT; and (4) the AVE CT in which the CT voxel values inside the IGTV were replaced by a constant density (AVE_RIGTV). For each strategy, the resulting cumulative dose distribution in a respiratory cycle was determined using a deformable image registration method. RESULTS: There were dosimetric differences between the apparent dose distribution, calculated on a single CT dataset, and the motion-corrected 4D dose distribution, calculated by combining dose distributions delivered to each phase of the 4DCT. The AVE_RIGTV plan using a 1-cm smearing parameter had the best overall target coverage and critical structure sparing. The MIP plan approach resulted in an unnecessarily large treatment volume. The AVE and FB plans using 1-cm smearing did not provide adequate 4D target coverage in all patients. By using a larger smearing value, adequate 4D target coverage could be achieved; however, critical organ doses were increased. CONCLUSION: The AVE_RIGTV approach is an effective strategy for designing proton treatment plans for mobile lung tumors

In the case of IM proton therapy, plans were compared also for two different sizes of the pencil beam. Finally, a 10% and 20% dose escalation with IM protons was planned, and the consequential organ at risk (OAR) irradiation was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 5 patients were computed for IM photons (7 coplanar fields) and protons (3 coplanar beams), using the KonRad inverse treatment planning system (developed at the German Cancer Research Center). IMPT planning was performed assuming 2 different sizes of the pencil beam: IMPT with a beam of full width at half-maximum of 20 mm, and IMPT with a "mini-beam" (IMPT(M), full width at half-maximum = 12 mm). Prescribed dose was 77.4 Gy or cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for protons to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Surface and center spinal cord dose constraint for all techniques was 64 and 53 Gy/CGE, respectively. Tumor and OAR dose-volume histograms were calculated. Results were analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient, and conformity index. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume coverage was optimal and equally homogeneous with both IM photon and IM proton plans. Compared to the IM photon plans, the use of IM proton beam therapy leads to a substantial reduction of the OAR total integral dose in the low-level to mid-dose level. Median heart, lung, kidney, stomach, and liver mean dose and dose at the 50% volume level were consistently reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 25. Tumor dose homogeneity in IMPT(M) plans was always better than with IMPT planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient, 0.19 vs. 0.25). IMPT dose escalation (to 92.9 CGE to the GTV) was possible in all patients without exceeding the normal-tissue dose limits. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of IM photon therapy, when compared to IM protons, can result in similar levels of tumor conformation. IM proton therapy, however, reduces the OAR integral dose substantially, compared to IM photon radiation therapy. As a result, tumor dose escalation was always possible with IM proton planning, within the maximal OAR dose constraints. In IM proton planning, reducing the size of the proton pencil beam (using the "mini-beam") improved the dose homogeneity, but it did not have a significant effect on the dose conformity

These data were compared with those measured in normal pituitary glands obtained from four cats and seven fresh human cadavers. The T1 and T2 measured at 24 degrees C in the tumors (mean +/- SD: 1,170 +/- 80 and 123 +/- 35 ms, respectively) were significantly higher than those of cadaver pituitary (830 +/- 200 and 76 +/- 12 ms) and cat pituitary gland (790 +/- 120 and 69 +/- 10 ms). Although the absolute values were lower, similar differences were present in T1 measured at 4 degrees C. Two-dimensional T2 versus T1 plot was particularly helpful in distinguishing tumor from the normal gland. When tumors were grouped according to density on CT, histology or previous treatment (e.g., irradiation or bromocriptine), there were no significant differences in T1 values between the groups. Bound water content was not found to correlate with T1 or T2 values. We concluded that pituitary adenomas can be distinguished from normal pituitary glands by their different relaxation properties when measured at high frequency in vitro MR

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From September 1992 to December 1996, 138 patients with FIGO Stages II and III and mean age of 56 years were treated. Median EBR to the whole pelvis was 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Parametrial boost was performed in 93% of patients, with a median dose of 14.4 Gy. Brachytherapy with HDR was performed during EBR or following its completion with a dose of 24 Gy in four weekly fractions of 6 Gy to point A. Median overall treatment time was of 60 days. Patient age, tumor stage, and overall treatment time were variables analyzed for survival and local control. Cumulative biologic effective dose (BED) at rectal and bladder reference points were correlated with late complications in these organs and dose of EBR at parametrium was correlated with small bowel complications. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 38 months. Overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control at 5 years was 53.7%, 52.7%, and 62%, respectively. By multivariate and univariate analysis, overall treatment time up to 50 days was the only statistically significant adverse variable for overall survival (p = 0.003) and actuarial local control (p = 0.008). The 5-year actuarial incidence of rectal, bladder, and small bowel late complications was 16%, 11%, and 14%, respectively. Patients treated with cumulative BED at rectum points above 110 Gy(3) and at bladder point above 125 Gy(3) had a higher but not statistically significant 5-year actuarial rate of complications at these organs (18% vs. 12%, p = 0.49 and 17% vs. 9%, p = 0.20, respectively). Patients who received parametrial doses larger than 59 Gy had a higher 5-year actuarial rate of complications in the small bowel; however, this was not statistically significant (19% vs. 10%, p = 0.260). CONCLUSION: This series suggests that 45 Gy to the whole pelvis combined with four fractions of 6 Gy to point A with HDR brachytherapy is an effective and safe fractionation schedule in the treatment of Stages II and III cervix cancer if realized up to 50 days. To decrease the small bowel complications, we decreased the superior border of the parametrial fields to the S2-S3 level and the total dose to 54 Gy	
1	4277	Effect of balloon occluded arterial infusion of anticancer drugs on the prognosis of cervical cancer treated with radiation therapy	Actuarial Analysis, Age Factors, Aged, Balloon Dilatation, Bone Marrow, Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Incidence, Infusions,Intra-Arterial/is [Instrumentation], Infusions,Intra-Arterial/mt [Methods], Japan, Methods, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radium, Rectum, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Urinary Bladder, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The effect of local injection of anticancer drugs by balloon catheter, i.e., balloon occluded arterial infusion (BOAI), on the prognosis of cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy were retrospectively estimated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-five patients with cervical cancer (Stage I-IV) treated by irradiation were included in the study. Among the 65 cases, 2 were in Stage I, 13 in Stage II, 40 in Stage III, and 10 in Stage IV. Patients who received surgical resection were excluded. Thirty-nine patients received BOAI and 44 received brachytherapy. Twenty-six patients were not indicated for BOAI because of insufficient renal function, hepatic complications, hematological complications, and refusal from the patients. Cisplatin (0.9-1.7 mg/kg), Adriamycin (0.7-0.9 mg/kg), and Pepleomycin (0.4-0.6 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously into the bilateral internal iliac arteries by BOAI. External irradiation was given by 10 MV x-ray. Total dose administered to the regional lymph nodes by the external irradiation was 48.3 +/- 8.7 Gy. Radium was used at brachytherapy. The dose delivered by the brachytherapy at point A was 45.3 +/- 14.9 Gy. Patients without brachytherapy received 26.1 +/- 19.1 Gy of boost irradiation by the external photon beam. The survival probabilities of the patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates of the Stage III patients with and without BOAI were 53 +/- 13% and 24 +/- 18%, respectively (p = 0.036). By multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model, stage and BOAI were selected as significant predictors of the prognosis. Transient bone marrow suppression was observed in about half of the patients with BOAI. No significant increase of the incidence of the late radiation damage by BOAI in rectum or in urinary bladder was observed. CONCLUSION: Balloon occluded arterial infusion of anticancer drugs may improve the prognosis of the patients with cervical cancer without increasing the incidence of the late radiation damage. A larger scale prospective randomized study is desired

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 899 patients, who had received the radioactive contrast medium Thorotrast for angiography in the 1930s and 1940s, and 662 controls were followed-up since 1968 every two years by standardized clinical and laboratory examinations. Initially, X-ray plain films of the thorax, upper abdomen and the former injection site were performed. In selected patients the sites of paravascular Thorotrast deposits were evaluated by ultrasonography, CT and MRI. RESULTS: Paravascular Thorotrast deposits were detected in 245 patients. Clinical symptoms related to deposits appeared 10 to 30 years after Thorotrast administration. The severity of symptoms depended on the location and extension of granulomas and were mainly caused by fibrosis, nerve paralysis and vascular changes. Four malignant tumors adjacent to granulomas were observed (one soft tissue sarcoma in the groin, two squamous cell carcinomas of the parotid gland and one lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the nasopharynx). MRI including MRA allowed an accurate determination of tissue damage, whereas the utility of US and CT was restricted due to strong sound attenuation and streak artefacts caused by the high X-ray absorption of Thorotrast. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Locoregional late effects of paravascular Thorotrast deposits mainly comprise radiation induced, fibrotic tissue destruction. The incidence of malignant tumors, in particular sarcomas, adjacent to deposits, however, is much lower than initially expected

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas

This is mainly due to the differences in internal radiosensitivity. This study was to analyze the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and lymphogenesis of tumor cells, and to explore the correlation of these factors to radiosensitivity. METHODS: P53 protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein, survivin protein, VEGF-C protein, Ki67 protein, and microvascular density (MVD) of 60 biopsy samples from radiosensitive group and 60 from radio-resistant group were detected by immunohistochemistry, respectively. Their correlations to clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rates of P53, VEGF, survivin, VEGF-C, Ki67 were 65.0%, 57.5%, 60.8%, 42.5%, 57.5%, respectively. The positive rates of P53 and VEGF, and MVD in the radio-sensitive group and in the radio-resistant group were (25.97+/-21.26)%, (18.50+/-19.86)%, 32.65+/-19.61 and (37.85+/-28.67)%, (30.83+/-23.94)%, 41.95+/-16.97, respectively (P<0.05). The positive rates of Survivin, VEGF-C, and Ki67 between the two groups had no statistic difference (P>0.05). The correlations between P53, VEGF, and MVD were obvious. CONCLUSION: P53 protein, VEGF protein and MVD might be biomolecular markers for evaluating the internal radiosensitivity of NPC patients

Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an extension of the Cox model, we based our analysis on a cohort of 1541 consecutive patients with unilateral choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated with protons (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 to 7 fractions) at the Harvard University (Boston, Mass) cyclotron between July 1, 1975, through December 31, 1993, and who were observed prospectively up to September 30, 1995. Patient survival and the status of the treated eye were updated annually. RESULTS: By September 1995 (median follow-up among survivors, 8 years), 137 patients underwent enucleation after radiotherapy for complications (n=103) or tumor regrowth (n=34). The overall 10-year rate of eye retention was 89% (95% confidence interval, 87%-91%). Of the 1541 patients, 300 died of tumor metastasis, 38 following enucleation of the affected eye (mean interval from enucleation to death, 25 months). The multivariate rate ratio for metastatic death associated with enucleation (modeled as a time-dependent covariate) was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4) for enucleation due to complications and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-6.3) for enucleation associated with tumor regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of tumor viability, enucleation after primary irradiation for choroidal melanoma has no deleterious effect on patients' survival. Enucleation concurrent with tumor regrowth is associated with high death rates; growth of the tumor in the eye may presage systemic recurrence and death from metastasis

The unfavorable prognosis of this type of cancer was improved by a combined treatment, consisting of surgical tumor reduction and implantation of a transhepatic drainage, followed by external radiation and intracatheter brachytherapy. Nine patients were treated in this manner, seven died 6-67 months after operation, two are still alive 7 and 13 months postoperatively

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bile duct carcinomas are notoriously difficult to cure, with locoregional recurrence the rule, even after radical resection. Adjuvant efforts have included various radiation modalities, with limited success. Recently, charged-particle radiotherapy has also been used in these patients. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis of 129 patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas treated between 1977 and 1987 through the University of California at San Francisco, including 22 patients treated at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with the charged particles helium and neon. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Survival, outcome, and complication results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were treated with surgery alone (S), 45 patients received conventional adjuvant x-ray radiotherapy (S + X), and 22 were treated with charged particles (S + CP). The median survival times were 6.5, 11, and 14 months, respectively, for the entire group, and 16, 16, and 23 months in patients treated with curative intent. There was a survival difference in patients undergoing total resection compared with debulking (p = 0.05) and minor resections (p = 0.0001). Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant irradiation, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional X (p = 0.0109). Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after irradiatio CONCLUSIONS: The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bile duct carcinomas are notoriously difficult to cure, with locoregional recurrence the rule, even after radical resection. Adjuvant efforts have included various radiation modalities, with limited success. Recently, charged-particle radiotherapy has also been used in these patients. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis of 129 patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas treated between 1977 and 1987 through the University of California at San Francisco, including 22 patients treated at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with the charged particles helium and neon. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Survival, outcome, and complication results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were treated with surgery alone (S), 45 patients received conventional adjuvant x-ray radiotherapy (S + X), and 22 were treated with charged particles (S + CP). The median survival times were 6.5, 11, and 14 months, respectively, for the entire group, and 16, 16, and 23 months in patients treated with curative intent. There was a survival difference in patients undergoing total resection compared with debulking (p = 0.05) and minor resections (p = 0.0001). Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant irradiation, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional X (p = 0.0109). Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after irradiatio CONCLUSIONS: The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease
