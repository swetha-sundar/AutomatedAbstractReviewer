BSRT is a description of an emerging radiation oncology procedure, where simulation, CT scan, treatment planning, and radiation treatment are synchronized with voluntary breath-hold, forced breath-hold, or breathing gating. The BSRT system consists of a breathing monitoring system (BMOS) and a linear accelerator gating hardware and software package. Two methods, a video camera-based method and the use of wraparound inductive plethysmography (RespiTrace), generate the BMOS signals. The BMOS signals and the synchronized fluoroscopic images are simultaneously recorded in the simulation room and are later analyzed to define the ideal treatment point (ITP) where organ motion is stationary. The BMOS signals at ITP can be used to gate a CT scanner or a linear accelerator to maintain the same organ configuration as in the simulation. The BSRT system allows breath-hold or gating. This dual role allows the system to be applicable for a variety of patients, i.e., the breath-hold method for those patients who can maintain and reproduce the ITP, and the forced breath-hold or gating method for those who are not ideal for voluntary breath-hold

Most patients had large melanomas; no eyes containing small melanomas developed anterior segment neovascularization. The mean onset of glaucoma was 14.1 months (range, 7-31 months). The incidence of anterior segment neovascularization increased with radiation dosage; there was an approximately three-fold increase at 80 GyE versus 60 GyE of helium ion radiation (23% vs. 8.5%) (P less than 0.05). Neovascular glaucoma occurred more commonly in larger tumors; the incidence was not affected by tumor location, presence of subretinal fluid, nor rate of tumor regression. Fifty-three percent of patients had some response with intraocular pressures of 21 mmHg or less to a combination of antiglaucoma treatments

This paper discusses the potential of 211At targeted by antibodies for tumor therapy and the possible advantage of 211At over beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides such as 131I currently employed in the field of radioimmunotherapy. Since the longest range alpha-particle from 211At is only 67 microns and the rate of energy loss is high (track averaged linear energy transfer LT approximately 120 keV/micron), a disintegration of 211At produces a large and extremely localized deposition of energy. A Monte-Carlo model has been developed for studying the stochastic fluctuation of alpha-particle hits and energy deposition in cell nuclei in an attempt to determine the efficacy of 211At-labeled antibodies for tumor cell inactivation. Calculations have been performed for 2 extreme conditions: (a) the case of 211At retained in the capillary, and (b) for a homogeneous distribution of 211At-labeled antibody in the tumor. The results of these two calculations represent the boundary conditions between which any real solution must lie. Finally, developments to the model to include antibody transport across the capillary membrane and through the tumor tissue are discussed

It included irradiation of the bed of tumor removed. Fast electron beam was produced by a small betatron (collimator size--5 x 6 cm and 8 x 12 cm) installed in the operating room. Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained

[German]	Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radium, Risk, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Since April 1983 patients with gynecologic tumors have been irradiated with the HDR afterloading method at the University Hospital of Cologne. The therapy scheme for the carcinoma of the cervix consists of a combination of intracavitary contact irradiation and external radiotherapy. Brachytherapy is preponderant in an early stage of tumor extension, whereas teletherapy contributes more to the total dose in advanced stages. At first, the pelvis is totally exposed to a homogenous irradiation, so the shrunken tumor can more easily be arrived by curietherapy. The therapy scheme is described for the different tumor stages with its dosages, fractionations, and treatment pauses. Besides the use of special multiple-way applicators, the risk organs are protected by collimating with a block the middle part of the external irradiation field as soon as the maximum permissible dose is reached. A special block shape minimizes the dose irregularities at the field borders. The total physical dose at point A is about 60 Gy. The high dose rate of HDR afterloading has to be considered when calculating the biologic efficient dose. Here the dose rate factor furnishes a rough relation to the established radium dosage

High-resolution 3D T2-weighted fast spin echo (3D FSE) MRI scans were obtained for 60 consecutive ocular melanoma patients using a 1.5 T MRI (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), in a standard head coil. These patients were subsequently treated with proton beam therapy at the UC Davis Cyclotron, Davis, CA. The tumor was delineated by placement of tantalum rings (radio-opaque markers) around the tumor periphery as defined by pupillary transillumination during surgery. A point light source, placed against the sclera, was also used to confirm ring agreement with indirect ophthalmoscopy. When necessary, intraoperative ultrasound was also performed. The patients were planned using EYEPLAN software and the tumor volumes were obtained. For analysis, the tumors were divided into four categories based on tumor height and basal diameter. In order to assess the impact of high-resolution 3D T2 FSE MRI, the tumor volumes were outlined on the MRI scans by two independent observers and the tumor volumes calculated for each patient. Six (10%) of 60 patients had tumors, which were not visible on 3D MRI images. These six patients had tumors with tumor heights < or = 3 mm. A small intraobserver variation with a mean of (-0.22 +/- 4)% was seen in tumor volumes delineated by 3D T2 FSE MR images. The ratio of tumor volumes measured on MRI to EYEPLAN for the largest to the smallest tumor volumes varied between 0.993 and 1.02 for 54 patients. The tumor volumes measured directly on 3D T2 FSE MRI ranged from 4.03 to 0.075 cm3. with a mean of 0.87 +/- 0.84 cm3. The tumor shapes obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images were comparable to the tumor shapes obtained using EYEPLAN software. The demonstration of intraocular tumor volumes with the high-resolution 3D fast spin echo T2 weighted MRI is excellent and provides additional information on tumor shape. We found a high degree of accuracy for tumor volumes with direct MRI volumetric measurements in uveal melanoma patients. In some patients with extra large tumors, the tumor base and shape was modified, because of the additional information obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images

This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma	
0	897	Radiation exposure of personnel during intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT): radiation protection aspects	Combined Modality Therapy/mt [Methods], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Italy, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Neutrons, Occupational Exposure, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Physics, Radiation, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a multidisciplinary procedure which combines two conventional methods of cancer treatment surgery and radiation therapy. The purpose is to deliver a large single dose to the surgically exposed tumor bed while minimizing doses to normal tissues. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is a technique which allows irradiating the patient directly after the surgical operation using a linear accelerator that can be situated in the operating room. For medical accelerators with energy over 10MeV the need to characterize the neutron spectra for this particular situation arises from the fact that, when neutron spectra is not fully known, it becomes necessary to be more cautious introducing a weight factor wR of 20 (maximum value). This leads to overesteem the equivalent dose due to neutrons and it indicates to introduce additional (mobile) shields for photon and neutrons radiation not easily achievable in an operating room	
0	2989	New modalities in cancer treatment: heavy charged particles	Elementary Particles, Gamma Rays, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Mesons, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Oxygen, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Research	Heavy charged particles represent the ultimate that the physicist can contribute to the development of radiation sources for therapy. Of the heavy charged particles, protons are the least expensive to accelerate and can be manipulated to give a sharply defined high-dose volume with a rapid fall-off of dose outside the target area. The biological properties of protons do not differ significantly from X or gamma rays. Negative pi mesons require an elaborate accelerator for their production. Pions offer the possibility of concentrating energy, some of it densely ionizing with a reduced oxygen enhancement ratio and elevated biological effectiveness within the designated tumour volume, while minimizing the dose of sparsely ionizing radiation to the normal tissues traversed. High-energy heavy ions offer the greatest flexibility and allow localized dose distributions and also, with the higher Z particles, a substantial reduction of the oxygen enhancement ratio can be achieved. The ultimate choice of particle depends upon what turns out to be the most important factor in radiotherapy--an improved localization of dose or a reduction in the dependence of cell killing on the presence of molecular oxygen

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1974 and 1995, 367 patients with chordomas (n = 195) and chondrosarcomas (n = 172) of the base of skull have been treated with combined megavoltage photon and 160 MeV proton radiotherapy. Following 3D treatment planning with delineation of target volumes and critical nontarget structures dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were calculated. Radiotherapy was given an 1.8 Gy or CGE (=Cobalt Gray Equivalent) dose per fraction, with prescribed target doses ranging from 63 CGE to 79.2 CGE (mean = 67.8 CGE). Doses to the brainstem surface were limited to < or = 64 CGE and to the brainstem center to < or = 53 CGE. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 6 months to 21.4 years (mean = 42.5 months). Brainstem toxicity was observed in 17 of 367 patients attributable to treatment, resulting in death of three patients. Actuarial rates of 5 and 10-year high-grade toxicity-free survival were 94 and 88%, respectively. Increased risk of brainstem toxicity was significantly associated with maximum dose to brainstem, volume of brainstem receiving > or = 50 CGE, > or = 55 CGE, and > or = 60 CGE, number of surgical procedures, and prevalence of diabetes or high blood pressure. Multivariate analysis identified three independent factors as important prognosticators: number of surgical procedures (p < 0.001), volume of the brainstem receiving 60 CGE (p < 0.001), and prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tolerance of brainstem to fractionated radiotherapy appears to be a steep function of tissue volume included in high dose regions rather than the maximum dose of brainstem alone. In addition, presence of predisposing factors as well as extent of surgical manipulation can significantly lower brainstem tolerance in the individual patient	
0	2420	Current developments in proton therapy: a review. [Review] [85 refs]	Engineering, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiobiology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The use of high-energy protons in radiotherapy was first proposed in 1946. In the last decade there has been a significant growth in the number of centres using protons in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disease. To date (January 1993) a total of more than 11,500 patients have been treated world-wide. Encouraging clinical results have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this article is to outline the advantages of proton beams and to review current developments in physics and engineering applied to the field of proton therapy with particular emphasis on proton accelerator technology and the development of proton therapy facilities. The production of clinically useful beams is discussed and the relative merits of different treatment systems compared. Reference is also made to the factors affecting the absorbed dose in a patient and to proton radiobiology together with the results of studies of comparisons of treatment planning with protons with that using conventional photon therapy. The dosimetry of proton beams is also reviewed. [References: 85]

The treatment technique consists of several moving field irradiations in noncoplanar planes at a linear accelerator facility. Using collimated narrow beams, a high concentration of dose within small volumes with a dose gradient of 10-15%/mm was obtained. The dose calculation was based on geometrical information of multiplanar CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system, which is usable at CT, MR, and positron emission tomography (PET) installations. Special computer programs for correction of the geometrical MR distortions allowed a precise correlation of the different imaging modalities. The therapist can use combinations of CT, MR, and PET data for defining target volume. For instance, the superior soft tissue contrast of MR coupled with the metabolic features of PET may be a useful addition in the radiation treatment planning process. Furthermore, other features such as calculated dose distribution to critical structures can also be transferred from one set of imaging data to another and can be displayed as three-dimensional shaded structures

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was sent to 198 German radiotherapy institutions. Data about patient characteristics, stage of disease, practice and fractionation of radiotherapy, outcome of therapy, etc. were systematically evaluated. 123 of 198 institutions answered the complete questionnaire (62.1%). RESULTS: Only 23 of the 123 institutions (18.7%) reported experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of adults. 18 institutions with 98 patients were evaluable. The majority of patients (72 of 98) was treated on a linear accelerator. The median single dose of radiotherapy was 2 Gy, while the median total dose was 24 Gy. 81 of 89 evaluable patients (91%) reached a local control of the treated lesion(s), 69 of those had a complete remission. Eight of 89 patients (9%) developed an in-field recurrence. 87.8% of patients experienced no acute and 97% of patients no late side effects of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience with radiotherapy of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis in adults in Germany is still very limited. Nevertheless, the clinical results-with high remission and local control rates-confirm the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the multidisciplinary treatment of this disease. Due to the small number of patients in this study despite higher incidence rates, the knowledge of this disease has to be multiplied in Germany. Future patients should be systematically included into a prospective radiotherapy registry

DESIGN: A prospective phase 2 clinical trial. SETTING: Loma Linda University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74%, and 72%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87% vs 49%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment

The CBCT projection data of a phantom were acquired during rotational megavoltage (MV) dose delivery up to 6 Gy to evaluate image quality under MV beam irradiation. A lung tumor patient was treated with a total dose of 48 Gy in four fractions, each fraction including seven coplanar and noncoplanar beams, as well as a full-angle rotational beam. Tumor registration was performed between a planning CT image and a CBCT image immediately after patient setup. The patient couch was adjusted according to the registration results, and then the registration was repeated three times: immediately before treatment, during treatment, and immediately after treatment. The phantom image quality of the kV CBCT was not visually degraded up to the rotational MV dose of 6 Gy. Tumor position during rotational dose delivery was verified for the first time using kV CBCT

One such method is to use positron emission tomography (PET), which takes advantage of the nuclear reactions that take place between protons and nuclei in the tissue. The dominant nuclear reaction in human muscle tissue involves oxygen nuclei and produces radioactive oxygen-15. Oxygen-15 decays through positron emission, and it is these positrons that go on to annihilate that produce the signal used in the PET technique. Finding the distribution of annihilation points, however, is not analogous to finding the proton dose distribution. The oxygen-15 and positrons travel finite distances within the tissue, blurring the detected PET distribution from the desired proton distribution. Through Monte Carlo modelling, an analysis of the differences between the positron, oxygen-15 and proton distributions has been made. The program SRIM 2003 was used to find the correlation between the three distributions within simulated muscle tissue. Results show that the distal edge of the proton Bragg peak correlates with the detectable positron distribution, which is a section of the dose distribution of interest due to the steep dose gradient and position of adjacent critical structures	
0	1760	Intensity modulated proton therapy: a clinical example	Adult, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Heart, Humans, Lung, Male, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sensitivity and Specificity, Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Switzerland, Thoracic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Thoracic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Video Recording, Water	In this paper, we report on the clinical application of fully automated three-dimensional intensity modulated proton therapy, as applied to a 34-year-old patient presenting with a thoracic chordoma. Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

Over the last 10 months, we've evaluated its contribution to the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by means of accelerated proton beam irradiation. MATERIAL: Using UBM, we have examined 55 cases of uveal melanoma's, whose anterior border was situated at 6 mm or less from the limbus and that were consequently treated by proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The presumed tumoral origin was the ciliary body's pars plicata in 13 cases and the pars plana or the choroid in 42 cases, 17 of which presented a tumoral invasion of the pars plicata. A pars plana detachment anterior to or surrounding the anterior tumoral border, was present in 22 cases. The height of the tumor could only be measured by UBM if it was less than 2.5 mm. Information gathered using UBM have contributed to an improvement of the therapy plan in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Because of the strong attenuation of the high frequency ultrasound signal, UBM can only be used for the examination of intra-ocular structures situated in direct neighbourhood to the global wall. Despite this technical limitation, ist contribution to the planning of the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by proton beam irradiation has appeared to be considerable

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 3,561 patients who underwent conformal radiation for prostate cancer. Therapy consisted of proton irradiation of the prostate and seminal vesicles and X-ray treatment of the pelvis when warranted. The number of treatments in which the balloon was tolerated was recorded. Results were stratified according to method of irradiation (protons alone vs. combined proton/X-ray) and method of planning (2D vs. 3D planning of X-ray fields in patients undergoing combination treatment). RESULTS: Of all the patients evaluated, 3,474 (97.6%) tolerated the balloon throughout treatment; 87 (2.4%) declined the balloon for 1 or more treatments and tolerated the balloon for 85.5% of their treatments. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant tolerance advantage in those who received protons alone compared with combination treatment (99.5% vs. 95.7%; p < 0.001). In patients undergoing combination treatment, chi-square analysis did not reveal significant tolerance differences in patients undergoing 3D vs. 2D planning for pelvic X-ray fields (95.74% vs. 95.72%; p = 0.990). CONCLUSIONS: Intrarectal balloons are well tolerated over a course of conformal prostate irradiation

METHODS: Over a 20-year period, 47 patients underwent 72 operative procedures for resection of cranial base chondrosarcomas. Thirty-three patients were previously untreated, whereas 14 patients previously had undergone surgery or radiation. Twenty-three patients had a single operation and 24 underwent staged (more than one) operations because of extensive disease. Patients who underwent subtotal resection also underwent radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Patients were evaluated at follow-up clinically and by imaging studies. RESULTS: Gross total resection was accomplished in 29 (61.7%) patients, and subtotal resection was accomplished in 18 patients (38.3%). The resection was better in patients who underwent a primary operation (gross total resection, 68.8 versus 46.7%) rather than a reoperation. Patients who underwent incomplete resection underwent postoperative radiotherapy, which included proton beam radiotherapy (15.6%), radiosurgery (68%), and fractionated radiation (15.6%). There were no operative deaths. Postoperative complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage, quadriparesis, infections, cranial nerve palsies, etc.) were observed in 10 patients (18%). The follow-up ranged from 2 to 255 months, with an average of 86 months. At the conclusion of study, 36 (76.6%) patients were alive, and 21 (44.7%) patients were alive without disease. Recurrence-free survival was 32% at 10 years in all patients, 42.3% in primary patients and 13.8% in those who underwent reoperation. The Karnofsky performance score was 82.4 +/- 9.8 before surgery, 85 +/- 12.5 at 1 year after surgery, and 85.3 +/- 5.8 at the latest follow-up. Two patients died as a result of radiotherapy complications (malignancy, radiation necrosis). CONCLUSION: Cranial base chondrosarcomas can be managed well by complete surgical resection or by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The study cannot comment about the efficacy of radiotherapy. Approximately half of the patients survived without recurrence at long-term follow-up (>132 mo). The functional status of the surviving patients was excellent at follow-up

There were 14 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 39.6 years. Six patients had chondroid chordomas. The most common presenting symptoms were headache and diplopia, and the most common presenting sign was extraocular palsy. Fifty-three operations directed at removal of the tumor were performed. Twenty-three patients received various forms of radiation therapy postoperatively, including conventional external beam therapy, heavy charged particles, and interstitial implants. The average length of follow-up is 5.6 years. Eleven of 26 patients have died; the mean duration of survival in this group, excluding 1 perioperative death, was 4 years and 2 months. Although the average survival time of 6 years and 4 months was the same in patients with typical chordomas (excluding the perioperative death and 1 patient lost to follow-up) and in those with the chondroid variant, all of the latter are still alive, whereas more than half of the patients with typical chordoma have died

The first series of patients include 37 with lesions in the brain, 5 in the thorax and 28 in the abdomen. The main advantages of NMR-CT are as follows: No ionizing irradiation exists. Sagittal and frontal tomograms are easily produced. Chemical status of tissue is shown by relaxation times (T1, T2) and proton density. Vascular structures are easily recognized and the blood flow can be estimated. Less bone artifacts are produced compared with X-ray CT. (XCT)

The investigated parameters were leaf width in the MLC, leaf transmission, related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. Seven head-and-neck patients with stage T1-T3N0-N2cM0 oropharyngeal cancer were studied. For each patient nine plans were made with a different set of linac/MLC parameters. The plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) v7.6c and PLATO RTS v2.6.4, ITP v1.1.8. A hypothetical ideal linac/MLC was introduced to investigate the influence of one parameter at a time without interaction of other parameters. When any of the three parameters was increased from the ideal set-up values (leaf width 2.5 mm, transmission 0%, penumbra 3 mm), the mean dose to the parotid glands increased, given the same tumour coverage. The largest increase was found for increasing leaf transmission. The investigation showed that by changing more than one parameter of the ideal linac/MLC set-up, the increase in the mean dose was smaller than the sum of dose increments for each parameter separately. As a reference to clinical practice, we also optimized the plans of the seven patients with the clinically used Elekta SLi 15, equipped with a standard MLC with a leaf width of 10 mm. As compared to the ideal linac, this resulted in an increase of the average dose to the parotid glands of 5.8 Gy

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1994 to March 2000, 163 patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Analysis was performed on 54 optic nerves (ONs) corresponding to 30 patients whose ONs had been included in the irradiated volume. These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of >4 years. All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before treatment. We evaluated the dose-complication probability and the prognostic factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon ion radiotherapy, using dose-volume histograms and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age of 30 patients (14 men, 16 women) was 57.2 years. Median prescribed total dose was 56.0 gray equivalents (GyE) at 3.0-4.0 GyE per fraction per day (range, 48-64 GyE; 16-18 fractions; 4-6 weeks). Of 54 ONs that were analyzed, 35 had been irradiated with <57 GyE (maximum dose [Dmax]) resulting in no visual loss. Conversely, 11 of the 19 ONs (58%) irradiated with >57 GyE (Dmax) suffered a decrease of visual acuity. In all of these cases, the ONs had been involved in the tumor before carbon ion radiotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, a dose of 20% of the volume of the ON (D20) was significantly associated with visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of visual loss seems to be correlated with a delivery of >60 GyE to 20% of the volume of the ON

The local character of the proton action, absence of irreversible changes in the brain, temporary, transient changes on the part of the oculomotor nerves (25.5%) and temporal lobes (9.3%) are demonstrated.

This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. RESULTS: The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. CONCLUSION: The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity	
1	1746	Uveal melanomas. Conservation treatment. [Review] [67 refs]	Boston, Brachytherapy, Breast, Helium, Humans, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Probability, Prostate, Quality of Life, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Risk, Survival, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision	Eye conservation can be achieved in patients with uveal melanomas by several techniques, with external beam charged particle (proton) therapy and episcleral radionuclide plaque therapy being used most commonly. The probability of visual preservation and of eye retention with either technique is related to tumor size and location. If vision is poor or absent in the fellow eye, even very large tumors can be treated with the proton beam, with a 75% to 80% probability of eye salvage and preservation of some degree of visual function. Local control is achieved in a large proportion of treated eyes with either technique probably because of the large doses that can be focally administered to these relatively small tumors with those techniques. Achieving local control may also contribute to improved survival in some patients. Survival clearly has not been compromised. Useful vision is preserved in eyes with tumors occurring in a favorable location with respect to the optic disc or macula. A dose-searching trial, aimed at improving visual outcome in patients with tumors in unfavorable locations, has been completed and has provided data to aid in designing future trials. Successfully treating uveal melanoma without removal of the involved eye is one of the major oncologic triumphs of the latter part of the 20th century. Very high rates of local control can be achieved with heavy charged particle external beam radiotherapy or 125I episcleral plaque brachytherapy, with preservation of a functionally useful eye in many patients. The excellent results in the eye melanoma patients treated with external beam proton therapy also demonstrate that almost all the patients can successfully cooperate in their treatment by voluntarily fixating the eye on a particular point during treatment, so that their tumor is positioned properly in the beam during treatment. Conservative treatment can achieve local control rates similar to or superior to those achieved with radiation therapy alone in other commonly treated solid tumors, including early stage carcinomas of the breast, vocal cord, and prostate. Continued careful follow-up of conservatively treated patients will provide even better understanding of the radiation effects on uveal melanomas and on normal ocular structures. It is also impressive that these gains have not been achieved at a cost of increased mortality: survival rates in irradiated patients are at least as good as after enucleation. Further observation will reveal whether these initial dramatic and encouraging results will be maintained. The COMS Study may provide additional data in this regard at least regarding survival after brachytherapy relative to enucleation. It will not, however, clarify indications for the two types of radiotherapy (brachytherapy and charged particle therapy) nor will it allow direct comparisons of acute and chronic ocular effects of those therapeutic modalities. The UCSF-LBL trial mentioned previously, which compared helium ion therapy with 125I episcleral plaque treatment, has documented the superiority of charged particle therapy to plaque therapy in terms of local tumor control and eye retention. Of interest is a recent survey reporting that choice of treatment for uveal melanoma did not seem to be associated with large differences in quality of life when assessed at long-term follow-up. The distant failures and metastatic deaths in uveal melanoma patients, more common with larger and more anteriorly located tumors, are most distressing. A randomized clinical trial of adjuvant systemic therapy is clearly indicated but has not been mounted because of the relatively poor results obtained with systemic therapy in metastatic melanoma patients. The recent report of improved survival in cutaneous melanoma patients at high risk for metastasis who were treated with interferon is encouraging, and it led to the initiation of the nonrandomized study described previously, which uses interferon following proton eye irradiation for patients with increased risk of metastasis. Other trials would clearly be indicated if more effective systemic therapies become available. [References: 67]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

The new model was verified by comparing measured and calculated wedge factors for the standard set of wedge angles (i.e., 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees), different symmetric and asymmetric fields, and two different photon energies. The maximum difference between calculated and measured wedge factors is less than 2%. The average absolute difference is within 1%. The obtained results indicate that the suggested model can be useful for independent dose calculation with enhanced dynamic wedges

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. RESULTS: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bile duct carcinomas are notoriously difficult to cure, with locoregional recurrence the rule, even after radical resection. Adjuvant efforts have included various radiation modalities, with limited success. Recently, charged-particle radiotherapy has also been used in these patients. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis of 129 patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas treated between 1977 and 1987 through the University of California at San Francisco, including 22 patients treated at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with the charged particles helium and neon. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Survival, outcome, and complication results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were treated with surgery alone (S), 45 patients received conventional adjuvant x-ray radiotherapy (S + X), and 22 were treated with charged particles (S + CP). The median survival times were 6.5, 11, and 14 months, respectively, for the entire group, and 16, 16, and 23 months in patients treated with curative intent. There was a survival difference in patients undergoing total resection compared with debulking (p = 0.05) and minor resections (p = 0.0001). Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant irradiation, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional X (p = 0.0109). Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after irradiatio CONCLUSIONS: The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease

At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, patient treatment with the 70 MeV proton beam began in November 1979, and 29 patients were treated through December 1984. Of 11 patients who received protons only, 9 have had local control of the tumor. Two of the 9 patients, suffering from recurrent tumor after radical photon beam irradiation, developed complications after proton treatment. In the patients treated with photons or neutrons followed by proton boost, tumors were controlled in 12 of 18 patients (66.6%), and no complications were observed in this series. Malignant melanoma could not be controlled with the proton beam. A spot-beam-scanning system for protons has been effectively used in the clinical trials to minimize the dose to the normal tissues and to concentrate the dose in the target volume. At the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center, University of Tsukuba, treatment with a vertical 250 MeV proton beam was begun in April 1983, and 22 patients were treated through February 1984. Local control of the tumor was observed in 14 of 22 patients (63.6%), whereas there was no local control in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. There have been no severe complications in patients treated at PARMS. The results suggest that local control of tumors will be better with proton beams than with photon beams, whereas additional modalities are required to manage radioresistant tumors

Proton bombarding in cyclotron has brought the radioactivity. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) investigation has been completed in 10 patients. The angiographies performed at 6 months revealed restenosis > 50% in five cases (50%). IVUS analysis demonstrated an absence of remodeling behind the stent, with no changes in total vessel volume (TVV; 353.6 +/- 126.3 and 343.9 +/- 90.6 mm(3)) or plaque + media volume (PMV; 171.7 +/- 57.4 and 166.8 +/- 42.6 mm(3)). On the other hand, lumen volume (LV) within the stent decreased significantly from 181.9 +/- 80.2 to 154.6 +/- 45.2 mm(3) (P < 0.02). This was due to presence of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) at both extremities of implanted stents. No chronic recoil of the implanted stents was found. The analysis of edges (5 mm distally and proximally to the last stent struts) showed no significant changes in TVV (187.3 +/- 62.60 and 176.9 +/- 53.5 mm(3)), but PMV increase significantly from 61.9 +/- 31.2 to 82.2 +/- 43.4 mm(3) (P < 0.04) and LV decreased from 125.2 +/- 40.7 to 94.7 +/- 22.0 mm(3) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, single (55)Co radioactive beta-emitting stents with high initial activity are effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia only within the stent body, as measured by IVUS, and they do not solve the problem of restenosis at the stent extremities as well as at the stent edges. Edge restenosis in this high radioactive stents was mainly (from 66%) due to neointimal proliferation. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc

Target volumes are irradiated using sequential 1.68-cm-thick slices with the patient moved between each successive slice delivery. Due to the method of delivery, superficial doses from a course of intensity modulated radiation therapy may be significantly different from doses delivered with conventional radiation therapy. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the superficial depth-dose distribution for geometric target volumes. Treatment plans were conducted for 5-cm-diam, 5-cm-long right cylindrical target volumes embedded in a 16-cm-diam, 12-cm-long water-equivalent cylindrical phantom. Three experiments were conducted with centrally located, off-centered, and superficial targets. Doses at superficial depths were measured using 3 x 3 x 1 mm3 thermoluminescent dosimetry chips. For all three targets, the measured doses were slightly greater than the calculated doses. Doses measured in the buildup region for the superficial target indicated that bolus would be required to provide the prescribed dose at the phantom surface

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

The results based on 84 treatments indicate that average monthly doses in the range 12-19 mrem can be expected for 30 daily treatments similar to those monitored. It was also found that 76% of the in-room dose was due to activated components in the treatment head, the balance of the in-room dose being due to activated concrete. Other statistics were obtained on patient in-room times and technologist times and doses outside the treatment room. Although the monthly film dosimetry records show no detectable doses for technologists working with these particular machines, in the spirit of ALARA, steps have been taken to reduce residual activities even further by choice of material less susceptible to activation

These include gamma units using cobalt-60; beams of protons, helium ions and neutrons; and modified cobalt-60 or linear accelerator units. These techniques allow delivery of a high dose of radiation in a single fraction to a small and well-defined intracranial volume, without delivering significant radiation to adjacent normal tissue. The most usual targets for radiosurgery are arteriovenous malformations. It is occasionally used for acoustic neuromas and primary or metastatic brain malignancies as well. Although radiosurgery is not a new procedure, its use is becoming more widespread. Nurses, as critical members of radiosurgery teams, must be informed about all aspects of the procedures and associated nursing care skills. [References: 7]

A second set of lateral lasers was mounted approximately 20 cm below the isocentre allowing patient positioning at an ergonomical height.

After a follow-up period of 12 months, the following was observed: reduction of the thickness of the tumor (significantly greater in the tumors which underwent brachytherapy) and morphological and structural changes which consisted in a thinning of the tumor and an increased reflectivity

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy	
1	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Iodine 125 plaques were used to treat all uveal melanomas between the end of 1989 and 1991. Since 1991, we have used iodine plaques for small anterior tumors and proton beam for other tumors. We use a plaque with a larger diameter than the tumor diameter (2-4mm) with a dose of 90Gy at the apex. Proton beam therapy is used for all tumors at the equator or posterior to the equator not thicker than 12mm. The dose given is 60Gy cobalt equivalent in four fractions. For each patient, the initial size and location of the tumor were noted as well as the follow-up each year: the outcome for the eye (local recurrence, ocular conservation, and functional results), the occurrence of metastasis, and survival. A statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between December 1989 and September 1998, 1272 patients were treated: 926 (72.8%) were treated with proton beam irradiation and 346 (27.8%) with iodine 125 plaques. The median follow-up was 5 years (60 months). For the patients treated with proton beam therapy, the mean age was 58 years, the tumor location was anterior to the equator for 3.8%, at the equator for 43.6%, and posterior to the equator for 52.6%. The mean tumor diameter was 13.4mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.69mm. For the patients treated with iodine 125 plaques, the mean age was 61.5 years. The location of the tumor was anterior to the equator for 34.4%, at the equator for 46.5%, and posterior to the equator for 19.1%. The mean tumor diameter was 11.5mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.12mm. The recurrence rate was 4% for the proton beam treatment and 3.75% for iodine plaques. There was no statistical difference. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the rate of local recurrence is usually higher with iodine 125 plaques than proton beam therapy. We discuss the risk factors for local recurrence after iodine 125 plaques: tumor diameter, lower dose to the tumor apex and lower dose rate, and posterior location of the tumor. We found a higher mortality rate in patients who presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: When we use iodine 125 plaques for anterior tumors with the proper dose and dose rate to the apex of the tumor, we do not find more recurrence than with proton beam therapy	
1	1137	Recent advances in light ion radiation therapy. [Review] [50 refs]	Algorithms, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Cell Cycle/ph [Physiology], Cell Division/ph [Physiology], Cell Survival, Electrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Hydrogen, Ions, Light, Linear Energy Transfer, Lithium, Motion, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/td [Trends], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/td [Trends], Survival, Sweden, Time, Treatment Outcome, Tritium	BACKGROUND: The fast development of energy- and intensity-modulated radiation therapy during the last two decades using photon and electron beams has when implemented resulted in a considerable improvement of radiation therapy, particularly if combined with radiobiologically based treatment optimization techniques. This has made intensity-modulated electron and photon beams as powerful as today's uniform dose proton therapy. To be able to cure also the most advanced hypoxic and radiation-resistant tumors of complex local spread, intensity-modulated light ion beams are really the ultimate tool and in clinical practice 2 to 3 times less expensive per patient treated than proton therapy. This development and the recent development of advanced tumor diagnostics based on PET-CT imaging of the tumor cell density open the field for new powerful radiobiologically based treatment optimization methods. The ultimate step is to use the unique radiobiologic and dose distributional advantages of light ion beams for truly optimized bioeffect planning where the integral three-dimensional dose delivery and tumor cell survival can be monitored by PET-CT imaging and corrected by biologically based adaptive therapy optimization methods. PURPOSE: The main purpose of the present paper is to discuss the principal areas of development of therapy optimization, by considering the therapy chain from tumor diagnostics and the use of three-dimensional predictive assay to biologically based treatment optimization with special focus on the rapid clinical development of advanced light ion therapy. METHODS: Besides the "classical" approaches using low ionization density hydrogen ions (protons, but also possibly deuterons and tritium nuclei) and high ionization density carbon ions, two new approaches will be discussed. In the first one, lithium or beryllium or boron ions, which induce the least detrimental biologic effect to normal tissues for a given biologic effect in a small volume of the tumor, will be key particles. In the second approach, referred patients will be given a high-dose, high-precision "boost" treatment with carbon or oxygen ions during 1 week preceding the final treatment with conventional radiation in the referring hospital. The rationale behind these approaches is to minimize the high ionization density dose to the normal-tissue stroma outside but sometimes also inside the tumor bed and to ensure a more uniform and optimal biologic effectiveness in the tumor, also on the microscopic scale. The present discussion indicates that BIologically Optimized predictive Assay based light ion Radiation Therapy (Bio-Art) is really the ultimate way to perform high-precision radiation therapy using checkpoints of the integral dose delivery and the tumor response and, based on this information, perform compensating corrections of the dose delivery. By using biologically optimized scanned high-energy photon or ion beams, it is possible to measure in vivo the three-dimensional dose delivery using the same PET-CT camera that was used for diagnosing the tumor spread. This method thus opens up the door for truly three-dimensional biologically optimized adaptive radiation therapy, where the measured dose delivery to the true target tissues can be used to fine-adjust the incoming beams, so that possible errors in the integral therapy process are eliminated toward the end of the treatment. Interestingly enough, practically all major error sources--such as organ motion, treatment planning errors, patient setup errors, and dose delivery problems due to gantry, multileaf, or scanning beam errors--can be corrected for in this way. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Radiobiologically optimized dose delivery using intensity and radiation quality modulation based on high-resolution PET-CT or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI)-based tumor and normal-tissue imaging is probably the ultimate development of radiation therapy, taking the unique physical and biologic advantages of light ions fully into account in truly patient-individualized curative treatment schedules. Using recently available biologically based treatment ilable biologically based treatment optimization algorithms, it is possible to improve the treatment outcome for advanced tumors by as much as 10-40%. The adaptive radiotherapy process based both on three-dimensional tumor cell survival and dose delivery monitoring has the potential of percent accuracy in tumor response and dose delivery monitoring, using two-dimensional, narrow high-energy photon beam scanning and three-dimensional (11)C Bragg peak scanning for radiation quality and intensity-modulated dose delivery. There is no doubt that the future of radiation therapy is very promising, and gradually more and more patients may not even need advanced surgery. Instead, they could be cured by biologically optimized electron, photon, or light ion therapy, where the densely ionizing Bragg peak is placed solely in the gross tumor, and a lower ionization density is used in microscopically invasive tumor volumes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an extension of the Cox model, we based our analysis on a cohort of 1541 consecutive patients with unilateral choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated with protons (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 to 7 fractions) at the Harvard University (Boston, Mass) cyclotron between July 1, 1975, through December 31, 1993, and who were observed prospectively up to September 30, 1995. Patient survival and the status of the treated eye were updated annually. RESULTS: By September 1995 (median follow-up among survivors, 8 years), 137 patients underwent enucleation after radiotherapy for complications (n=103) or tumor regrowth (n=34). The overall 10-year rate of eye retention was 89% (95% confidence interval, 87%-91%). Of the 1541 patients, 300 died of tumor metastasis, 38 following enucleation of the affected eye (mean interval from enucleation to death, 25 months). The multivariate rate ratio for metastatic death associated with enucleation (modeled as a time-dependent covariate) was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4) for enucleation due to complications and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-6.3) for enucleation associated with tumor regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of tumor viability, enucleation after primary irradiation for choroidal melanoma has no deleterious effect on patients' survival. Enucleation concurrent with tumor regrowth is associated with high death rates; growth of the tumor in the eye may presage systemic recurrence and death from metastasis

METHODS: Three hundred nineteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer and initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 15.0 ng/mL or less received conformal radiation doses of 74 to 75 cobalt gray equivalent with protons alone or combined with photons. No patient had pre- or post-treatment hormonal therapy until disease progression was documented. Patients were evaluated for biochemical disease-free survival, PSA nadir, and toxicity; the mean and median follow-up period was 43 months. RESULTS: Overall 5-year clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates were 97% and 88%, respectively. Initial PSA level, stage, and post-treatment PSA nadir were independent prognostic variables for biochemical disease-free survival: a PSA nadir 0.5 ng/mL or less was associated with a 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rate of 98%, versus 88% and 42% for nadirs 0.51 to 1.0 and greater than 1.0 ng/mL, respectively. No severe treatment-related morbidity was seen. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that patients treated with conformal protons have 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rates comparable to those who undergo radical prostatectomy, and display no significant toxicity. A Phase III randomized dose-escalation trial is underway to define the optimum radiation dose for early-stage prostate cancer

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

METHODS: 30 enucleated eyes were included for histopathological study and Ki-67 immunostaining. Patients were enucleated between 1991 and 1996 for uveal melanoma, 14 after proton beam irradiation and 16 without treatment (control group). The mean follow up period was 2.5 years after diagnosis and 1 year after enucleation. RESULTS: A significant relation was found between Ki-67 score and mitotic index (r = 0.56, p = 0.001), histological largest tumour diameter (r = 0.38, p = 0. 03), fibrosis (r = -0.35, p = 0.05), absence of tumoral pigmentation (p = 0.05), and presence of vascular thrombosis (p = 0.03). The Ki-67 score was significantly higher in the non-irradiated group (p = 0.01) and in the group of patients whose cause of enucleation was tumoral evolution (p = 0.005) compared with the group of patients enucleated after neovascular glaucoma. The Ki-67 score was very high in a case of orbital recurrence of uveal melanoma and metastatic death. 70% of metastasised tumours showed a Ki-67 score higher than the median value. CONCLUSION: Ki-67 labelling is a reliable method of estimating the proliferative activity in uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation. The Ki-67 score is significantly correlated with prognostic variables (mitotic index and histological largest tumour diameter), and with radiation effects after proton beam irradiation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT

Due to the finite range and the sharpness of the dose gradients, the dose to well defined target volumes can be raised without excessive irradiation of non-target tissue. The prescribed proton doses are determined in part on the basis of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the particular radiation quality. In this study, RBE values were determined for a proton beam with a maximal range of 33 mm, which corresponds to an energy of approximately 67 MeV. The range modulated depth-dose distribution, with a 20 mm extended Bragg peak, was mainly designed for high precision treatment of small targets such as uveal melanomas. The tested cell lines, LS-174T and V79-379A, were chosen because of their suitability for clonogenic assays. The cells were irradiated with single doses in the range 2-10 Gy at different depths in the extended peak region of the range modulated proton beam. RBE values were determined by comparing the doses needed to obtain the same reduction in colony formation (0.5, 0.1 and 0.01) as with the reference 60Co gamma source. The mean RBE value was 1.22 with a standard deviation of 0.08. The variations depended on both cell type and on the survival levels considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A total of 184 patients were treated. The authors have been of opinion that therapeutic methods depended on function of the neuroendocrine system and adrenal cortex, e. g. reserpine used after gamma-therapy alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy increased the efficacy of therapy and reduced the time of remission. Parlodel used alone or in combination with chloditan could be used in therapy of early forms of the disease in young patients. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy and proton beam therapy of the hypophysis were recommended in hypophysial adenomas. Proton beam therapy of the hypophysis was an effective method for therapy of patients with diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and could be used in diffuse nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy

The most effective approaches to therapy of oropharyngeal tumors with account of their site, spread and degrees of differentiation were developed. The most effective method was shown to be the combination of gamma-beam therapy (50 Gy) with electron-photon radiation (20 Gy) of an accelerator of 18-20 MeV, radiation exposure of normal tissues being lowered by approximately 10-20% as compared to that in gamma-beam therapy used alone. The use of the above method in 45 oropharyngeal cancer patients resulted in an immediate clinical effect (disappearance of a tumor and regional metastases (if any) in 60% of the patients. The 2-year survival rate calculated by actuarial curves, was 62 +/- 10%

To achieve this goal, tighter treatment margins are needed, which require more accurate delineation of the prostate target and normal tissue at the time of treatment planning and before actual daily treatments. Modem radiation therapy techniques can deposit conformal dose virtually anywhere in the body; however, this precise therapy is of no value if it is not accurately hitting the target. Whether dose escalation is achieved by external beam techniques (eg, IMRT, protons) or brachytherapy, these ba-sic planning and delivery considerations are essentially the same. Future directions in prostate radiation therapy will use even higher radiation doses,alternative fractionation patterns, intraprostatic targets (eg, prostate tumor seen on MRI), and improved patient selection regarding which patients will benefit the most from these advanced techniques.

Most published studies on radiation toxicity have been performed retrospectively. Our prospective study was launched in 1996 to measure the in vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes before treatment with radical radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer, and to assess the early and the late radiation skin side effects in the same group of patients. We prospectively recruited consecutive breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy after breast surgery. To evaluate whether early and late side effects of radiotherapy can be predicted by the assay, a study was conducted of the association between the results of in vitro radiosensitivity tests and acute and late adverse radiation effects. METHODS: Intrinsic molecular radiosensitivity was measured by using an initial radiation-induced DNA damage assay on lymphocytes obtained from breast cancer patients before radiotherapy. Acute reactions were assessed in 108 of these patients on the last treatment day. Late morbidity was assessed after 7 years of follow-up in some of these patients. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) morbidity score system was used for both assessments. RESULTS: Radiosensitivity values obtained using the in vitro test showed no relation with the acute or late adverse skin reactions observed. There was no evidence of a relation between acute and late normal tissue reactions assessed in the same patients. A positive relation was found between the treatment volume and both early and late side effects. CONCLUSION: After radiation treatment, a number of cells containing major changes can have a long survival and disappear very slowly, becoming a chronic focus of immunological system stimulation. This stimulation can produce, in a stochastic manner, late radiation-related adverse effects of varying severity. Further research is warranted to identify the major determinants of normal tissue radiation response to make it possible to individualize treatments and improve the outcome of radiotherapy in cancer patients

Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1989, 84 evaluable patients were treated. PR patients (n = 45) were planned/localized on the basis of biplane angiography and treated between 1989 and 2000. BL patients (n = 39) were planned/localized on the basis of CT/MRI and treated since 2000. Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival, nidus obliteration (NO), and any radiographic improvement were undertaken with Cox regression of dose and volume effects. RESULTS: No significant complication, survival, previous embolization incidence, AVM location or size differences existed between BL/PR patients. The groups differed significantly in prescribed dose (PR: 16.2 Gy, BL: 17.3 Gy, p = 0.004) and isodose (PR: 62%, BL: 79%, p < 0.0001). Estimated 2-year NO rate was 87% for BL patients, 12% for PR patients (p < 0.0001). Ultimate PR NO rate was 67% at 6 years. Dose (p = 0.037) and isodose (p = 0.014) significantly affected PR NO outcome; volume was of borderline significance (p = 0.069). No factors significantly affected BL outcome. Analyses of small (< or = 4.0 cm3), high-dose (> or = 17.0 Gy) PR patients (PR1 group) vs. BL patients still demonstrated greater NO (p = 0.04) and radiographic improvement (p = 0.0004) rates for the BL group. PR1 patients had a 76% 3-year NO rate. CONCLUSIONS: BL-based radiosurgery achieved a high NO rate, the PR method did not. Differences in outcomes between PR/BL groups may be due to localization methods or an inherent advantage with the BL system. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel

[Review] [27 refs]	Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Pelvic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Sacrococcygeal Region, Survival Rate	Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms representing less than 3% of all primary bone tumors. They usually have a benign histological appearance and a slow growth rate. Their locoregional progression nearly always causes suffering and eventually death. Efforts to increase local control have included aggressive surgery, radiation therapy or combined approaches but locally free survival rates remain relatively low and have not exceeded 30% at 5 years. Sacrococcygeal chordomas, which represent approximately 50% of the localizations, have been investigated less frequently than those at the base of the skull or cervical region with primary or post-operative radiation therapy. The disappointing results with photon therapy in a multimodality approach and the good results reported by Schoenthaler with charged particles in the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory led us to propose fast neutron therapy in the management of inoperable or recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. Preliminary results obtained from only 12 patients indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy seems to be a good alternative for radical treatment of chordomas in the case of microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor.

The current paradigm requires stereotactic head ring placement for the patient's first fraction. The stereotactic coordinates and treatment plan are determined relative to this head ring. The IRLEDs are attached to the patient via a maxillary bite plate, and the position of the IRLEDs relative to linac isocenter is saved to file. These positions are then recalled for each subsequent treatment to position the patient for fractionated therapy. The purpose of this article was to report a method of predicting the desired IRLED locations without need for the invasive head ring. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To achieve the goal of frameless optic-guided radiotherapy, a method is required for direct localization of the IRLED positions from a CT scan. Because it is difficult to localize the exact point of light emission from a CT scan of an IRLED, a new bite plate was designed that contains eight aluminum fiducial markers along with the six IRLEDs. After a calibration procedure to establish the spatial relationship of the IRLEDs to the aluminum fiducial markers, the stereotactic coordinates of the IRLED light emission points are determined by localizing the aluminum fiducial markers in a stereotactic CT scan. RESULTS: To test the accuracy of direct CT determination of the IRLED positions, phantom tests were performed. The average accuracy of isocenter localization using the IRLED bite plate was 0.65 +/- 0. 17 mm for these phantom tests. In addition, the optic-guided system has a unique compatibility with the stereotactic head ring. Therefore, the isocentric localization capability was clinically tested using the stereotactic head ring as the absolute standard. The ongoing clinical trial has shown the frameless system to provide a patient localization accuracy of 1.11 +/- 0.3 mm compared with the head ring. CONCLUSION: Optic-guided radiotherapy using IRLEDs provides a mechanism through which setup accuracy may be improved over conventional techniques. To date, this optic-guided therapy has been used only as a hybrid system that requires use of the stereotactic head ring for the first fraction. This has limited its use in the routine clinical setting. Computation of the desired IRLED positions eliminates the need for the invasive head ring for the first fraction. This allows application of optic-guided therapy to a larger cohort of patients, and also facilitates the initiation of extracranial optic-guided radiotherapy

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

This is particularly evident in patients with useful hearing, in whom fractionated RT offers the potential for hearing preservation. Our objective was to determine the disease control, hearing preservation (via audiograms), and toxicity rates after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiation for acoustic neuroma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 72 acoustic neuroma patients underwent stereotactic irradiation and had at least 6 months of follow-up between October 1997 and March 2002. Of these, 45 received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 27 received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Before treatment, all SRS patients were functionally deaf and 23 of 25 SRT patients had useful hearing in the affected ear. The minimal peripheral dose was 12 Gy and 45 Gy in all SRS and SRT patients, respectively. Tumor control, toxicity, and hearing preservation were recorded. RESULTS: The median follow-up in the SRS and SRT groups was 27 and 26 months, respectively. No tumor progression was seen after SRS and SRT. On the basis of the audiogram criteria, the 1-year and 2-year hearing preservation rate was 85% and 57%, respectively. The mean pre- and post-SRT speech recognition threshold was 20 and 38 dB, respectively. The mean proportion of pre- and post-SRT speech discrimination was 91% and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic RT achieves good local control, with acceptable toxicity. RT fractionation appears to provide encouraging rates of hearing preservation

CT consisted of two cycles of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2, by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days and cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on day 4 with mannitol-induced diuresis at 4-week intervals. Postoperatively, RT was administered when resection margins were minimal or if paraesophageal nodes were abnormal; the RT consisted of 5,000 to 5,400 cGy to the tumor area plus a 800- to 1,200-cGy boost to known abnormal tumor margins. Nineteen of 24 patients were resectable (79%). There was one SR death (5%). One of 22 had a normal barium swallow post-CT, no visible tumor at SR, and no pathologic evidence of any residual disease. There was complete radiologic and gross clinical disappearance of tumor post-CT or post-SR in ten of 22 patients (45%). Four of 22 (18%) had greater than or equal to 50% regression, and five of 22 (23%) had no response. Toxicity of CT was mild. Eight of 19 patients (42%) received RT, and six of 19 (32%) received CT postoperatively. Sixteen of 24 (67%) are alive with a median duration of observation of 9.5 months. Eight of 24 (33%) are dead, five of whom had not responded to preoperative CT. Ten of 14 responders are alive and disease free. The mean survival time for nonresponders was 6.70 months and for responders, 20.40 months, with the longest survivor disease free at 45 months

We sought to determine if MI levels correlate with cerebral astrocytoma grade. METHODS: Five control subjects, 14 patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 10 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent single-volume HMRS with an echo time of 20 ms. Twenty-five patients had received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy previously. Using the curve-fitting program supplied by the manufacturer, peak areas for n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and MI were normalized with respect to the peak area of creatine (Cr). Ratios for MI/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr were obtained for each lesion and retrospectively compared with the histologic grade of the lesion. RESULTS: Levels of MI/Cr were higher (0.82 +/- 0.25) in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, intermediate (0.49 +/- 0.07) in control subjects, and lower in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (0.33 +/- 0.16) and GBM (0.15 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a trend toward lower MI levels in the presence of anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs compared with those of low-grade astrocytomas. MI levels may have implications in the grading of cerebral astrocytomas

One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

The author has learned importance of audacity on the part of the neurosurgeon. Personal experience of 37 CVM's (including 30 AV angiomas, 4 cryptic AVM's, and 3 other types of CVM's was analyzed. Of 37, 34 were operated on. Three were considered inoperable and were treated with radiotherapy (including proton beam). Of the 34 operated (30 AVM), 31 (24 AVM) were totally removed. None of them died or exhibitied deterioration. Of the 3 partially operated cases, one improved, two remained unchanged, but one of the two died of rebleeding 3 months later. Two of the radiated cases were later severely incapacitated due to rebleeding. One that underwent proton therapy is still under observation without deterioration after 18 months	
1	2908	Proton irradiation of malignant melanoma of the ciliary body	Ciliary Body, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Ultrasonography	This is our first case of malignant melanoma of the ciliary body treated with proton beam irradiation, a technique that we developed for irradiating choroidal melanomas. After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22). When BNCT is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA and radiobiological considerations, promising clinical results have been obtained, although many problems and issues remain to be solved

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site

The technique used to achieve these results was simplified through the physical characteristics of the radioelement and the optimized-dosimetry program employed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 78 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine 125. About 100 Gy were delivered to the superior pole of the tumour. The minimal length of follow-up was 17 months and the average, 67 months. RESULTS: There was 88% local control, leading to lowered visual acuity in 76% of the cases. Radiation retinopathy, directly related to proximity to the macula, is the principle etiology. Seven patients died of hepatic metastasis, five patients were enucleated. Four patients were further treated with protontherapy to make up for noncontrol locally. CONCLUSION: One dose of 100 Gy to the superior pole of the tumor seemed to lead to good local control, with the exception of complications related to proximity to the macula and the optic nerve. In this attempt to optimize irradiation, the time lapse between any benefit in local control derived from irradiation and posttherapeutic complications observed remains insufficient to evaluate any relationship

METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan

METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed	
0	3780	The 200-MeV proton therapy project at the Paul Scherrer Institute: conceptual design and practical realization	Cyclotrons, Head, Humans, Optics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiography, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Research, Rotation, Switzerland, X-Rays	The new proton therapy facility is being assembled at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The beam delivered by the PSI sector cyclotron can be split and brought into a new hall where it is degraded from 590 MeV down to an energy in the range of 85-270 MeV. A new beam line following the degrader is used to clean the low-energetic beam in phase space and momentum band. The analyzed beam is then injected into a compact isocentric gantry, where it is applied to the patient using a new dynamic treatment modality, the so-called spot-scanning technique. This technique will permit full three-dimensional conformation of the dose to the target volume to be realized in a routine way without the need for individualized patient hardware like collimators and compensators. By combining the scanning of the focused pencil beam within the beam optics of the gantry and by mounting the patient table eccentrically on the gantry, the diameter of the rotating structure has been reduced to only 4 m. In the article the degrees of freedom available on the gantry to apply the beam to the patient (with two rotations for head treatments) are also discussed. The devices for the positioning of the patient on the gantry (x rays and proton radiography) and outside the treatment room (the patient transporter system and the modified mechanics of the computer tomograph unit) are briefly presented. The status of the facility and first experimental results are introduced for later reference

Common to all of these methods is the time-dependent change of certain accelerator parameters during radiation treatment. The accelerators for which these methods can be used are equipped with independent collimator jaws, however, not with any kind of multileaf collimation. This method was designed to deposit a certain group of dose distributions that are restricted by a small number of constraints. The developed methods were implemented into a digitally controlled medical linear accelerator and the dosimetric results of such treatments were evaluated. Dose distributions with spatial dependencies in one and in two dimensions were deposited by movement of one X-ray jaw pair. Furthermore, a method for generation of a two-dimensional rotationally symmetric dose distribution was developed

Potential of proton beam as an alternative to brachytherapy	Aged, Brachytherapy, Female, Humans, Japan, Lymphatic Irradiation, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uterine Cervicitis/et [Etiology], Vaginal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Vaginal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vaginitis/et [Etiology]	Fifteen patients with advanced gynecologic malignancies were treated with high-energy proton beam radiation therapy (RT) at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center (PARMS), Tsukuba University, Japan, from 1983 to 1987. The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

High initial level of alpha 1-antitrypsin(alpha 1-AT) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-MG) in the patients blood plasma as well as a decrease in alpha 1-AT activity in cerebrospinal fluid were observed. Within a year after the proton hypophysectomy activity of the proteinase inhibitors returned to the normal values in blood and cerebrospinal fluid simultaneously with clinical restoration and a decrease in content of growth hormone; their level were maintained at normal values within the last two years of observation. Estimation of alpha 1-At activity in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid might be used as an additional test in evaluation of the treatment course in the patients with somatotropic adenoma of hypophysis

The tumor mass usually surrounds the spinal cord and infiltrates vertebral bone. A combined technique using protons or electrons to boost the initial photon fields is generally applied. We evaluated the use of dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy as an alternative technique for treating advanced cervical chordoma. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A female patient with incomplete resection of a vertebral chordoma surrounding C2-C3 was irradiated with a total dose of 58 Gy (ICRU point) in 2 Gy daily fractions for 29 days between December 2001 and January 2002. Beam arrangement consisted of seven 6 MV non-opposed coplanar fields. Pretreatment quality assurance included checking of the absolute dose at reference points and 2D dose map analysis. Treatment was delivered with a 120-leaf collimator in sliding window mode. To verify the daily setup, portal images at 0 degrees and 90 degrees were compared with the simulation images before treatment delivery (manual matching) and after treatment delivery (automatic anatomy matching). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The mean dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 57.6 +/- 2.1 Gy covering 95% of the PTV per 95% isodose. The minimum dose to the PTV (D99) was 53.6 Gy in the overlapping area between the PTV and the spinal cord planning organ at risk volume (PRV). The maximum dose to the spinal cord was 42.2 Gy and to the spinal cord PRV (8 mm margin) 53.7 Gy. The mean dose to the parotid glands was 37.4 Gy (homolateral gland) and 19.5 Gy (contralateral gland). Average deviation in setup was -1.1 +/- 2.5 mm (anterior-posterior), 2.4 +/- 1.3 mm (latero-lateral), 0.7 +/- 0.9 mm (craniocaudal) and -0.43 +/- 1 degree (rotation). CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of chordomas surrounding the spinal cord, intensity-modulated radiotherapy can provide high dose homogeneity and PTV coverage. Frequent digital portal image-based setup control is able to reduce random positioning errors for head and neck cancer patients immobilized with conventional thermoplastic masks

[Hungarian]	Adult, Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Heart, Humans, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prescriptions,Non-Drug, Prescriptions,Non-Drug/st [Standards], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	PURPOSE: To analyze the treatment plans of breast irradiation performed with two tangential beams, to discuss the importance of dose prescription, and to estimate the differences in delivered dose due to various dose prescription methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was performed between the Hungarian radiotherapy centers in order to compare the dose prescription methods. Then, treatment plans of 125 breast cancer patients treated in our department were evaluated. The irradiations were performed with cobalt unit, and with 6 and 9 MV photon beams of linear accelerators. The dose distributions were normalized to izocenter, then dose values in five points in central plane; local medial, lateral and central maximums (D(med), D(lat) and D(cent)); volumetric maximum and its location were determined. To characterize the dose to lung and to heart at left-sided tumors the central lung distance (CLD) and maximum heart distance (MHD) were used. Based on the results, estimation was made to assess the differences between delivered dose due to various dose prescriptions applied at the institutions. RESULTS: Four types of dose prescription are currently used in our country, and most frequently the isocenter is selected as a reference point. In the central plane the calculated dose in all but one points differed only a little from the dose to isocenter. The mean D(med), D(lat) and D(cent) were 107%, 107% and 101%, respectively. The volumetric maximum was on average 13% higher than the dose to isocenter. Regarding the beam qualities, this value was 16%, 13% and 11% for cobalt unit, 6 MV and 9 MV photon beams, respectively. The mean CLD and MHD were 1.9 and 0.8 cm, respectively. The difference between delivered doses at the institutions was 6% on average, but in extreme cases it can be as high as 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional treatment planning and plan evaluation are recommended at breast irradiation, especially for large breasts. Since the various dose prescriptions may result in significant differences in the delivered doses, use of a standard dose prescription protocol is recommended

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

At McGill University, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is given with a linear accelerator-based dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery unit. The first treatment is given using the stereotactic frame for target localization and head immobilization. Subsequent treatments are given using skin tattoos and laser alignment for target placement within the isocenter of the linear accelerator, and a modified portable halo-ring device is used for skull immobilization. Typically, a marginal dose of 42 Gy was prescribed at the margins of the lesion, divided in 6 fractions and given over a 2-week period. We report the pathological profile and treatment results in a series of 21 patients with a variety of intracranial tumors, treated in this manner between May 1987 and April 1990. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be a worthwhile procedure for the treatment of well-selected patients with intracranial neoplasms

Thirty-six of 30 patients either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Seventeen of 18 patients followed up for at least one year after therapy demonstrated tumor regression, with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 40%. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged-particle external-beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site

After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

Cytogenetic aberrations, growth alterations, responses to a second irradiation, and mutant frequencies at the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and thymidine kinase loci were determined. A greater percentage of clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles exhibited instability (defined as clones showing one or more outlying characteristics) than in the case of those that survived gamma irradiation. The phenotypes of the unstable clones that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles were also qualitatively different from those of the clones that survived gamma irradiation. A greater percentage (20%) of the unstable clones that survived gamma irradiation than those that survived exposure to (56)Fe particles (4%) showed an altered response to the second irradiation, while an increase in the percentage of clones that had an outlying frequency of ouabain-resistant and thymidine kinase mutants was more evident in the clones exposed to (56)Fe particles than in those exposed to gamma rays. Growth alterations and increases in dicentric chromosomes were found only in clones with more than one alteration. These results underscore the complex nature of genomic instability and the likelihood that radiation-induced genomic instability arises from different original events

After 40 Gy/4 weeks of conventional fractionation we have accelerated the treatment in the last week giving two daily fractions of 2 Gy each, 4-6 h apart in the bladder only. Although the follow-up of some of the patients is not very long our results indicate that this relatively short radiotherapeutic scheme is feasible, convenient and probably safe for patients living in remote areas

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose-volume histograms were compared between photon, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton plans at doses of 66 Gy, 87.5 Gy in Stage I (n=10) and 60-63 Gy, and 74 Gy in Stage III (n=15). RESULTS: For Stage I, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 31.8%, 24.6%, and 15.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 66 Gy, whereas they were 13.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, with proton with dose escalation to 87.5 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (p=0.002). For Stage III, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 54.1%, 46.9%, and 34.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 63 Gy, whereas they were 39.7%, 36.6%, and 31.6%, respectively, for proton with dose escalation to 74 CGE (p=0.002). In all cases, the doses to lung, spinal cord, heart, esophagus, and integral dose were lower with proton therapy even compared with IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation, compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor was located in the parotid gland in 59%, submandibular gland in 14%, oral cavity in 23%, and elsewhere in 5%. In 386 of 498 patients surgery was combined with radiotherapy, with a median dose of 62 Gy. Median delay between surgery and radiotherapy was 6 weeks. In the postoperative radiotherapy group, adverse prognostic factors prevailed. Elective radiotherapy to the neck was given in 40%, with a median dose of 50 Gy. Primary radiotherapy (n = 40) was given for unresectable disease or M(1), with a dose range of 28-74 Gy. RESULTS: Postoperative radiotherapy improved 10-year local control significantly compared with surgery alone in T(3-4) tumors (84% vs. 18%), in patients with close (95% vs. 55%) and incomplete resection (82% vs. 44%), in bone invasion (86% vs. 54%), and perineural invasion (88% vs. 60%). Local control was not correlated with interval between surgery and radiotherapy. No dose-response relationship was shown. Postoperative radiotherapy significantly improved regional control in the pN(+) neck (86% vs. 62% for surgery alone). A rating scale for different sites, T stage, and histologic type may be applied to calculate the risk of disease in the neck at presentation, and so indicate the need for elective neck treatment. A marginal dose-response was seen, in favor of a dose > or =46 Gy. A clear dose-response relationship was shown for patients treated with primary radiotherapy. Five-year local control was 50% with a dose of 66-70 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative radiotherapy with a dose of at least 60 Gy is indicated for patients with T(3-4) tumors, incomplete or close resection, bone invasion, perineural invasion, and pN(+). In unresectable tumors, a dose of at least 66 Gy is advisable

The proton beam, generated via a combination of Van de Graaff accelerator and cyclotron, is prepared by passive shaping for conformal tumor irradiation. A digital X-ray verification of the tumor location with the patient in sitting position limits the position uncertainties to a maximum of 0.3 mm. The treatment planning is performed using the program EYEPLAN. OCTOPUS, a CT-based planning program developed in cooperation with the German Cancer Research Center of Heidelberg, is under pre-clinical testing. Thus far, more than 400 patients have been irradiated. The first results are comparable to those obtained in other proton therapy centers. At the end of 2002, the University Hospital of Essen has also become a cooperation partner of the Hahn-Meitner Institute

This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

[Review] [58 refs]	Brachytherapy, Child, Dose Fractionation, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], France, Humans, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Research	There have been considerable technical improvements in radiation therapy for the past two decades. In children affected with cancer, these have been likely overshadowed by concommittant major chemotherapy-based advances, and at least in part ignored and misused. This article outlines principles, technological requirements, and clinical applications of innovations that aim at improving ballistical selectivity (such as conformal, intensity modulation, stereotactic photons, charged particles, and intraoperative therapies), as well as at influencing tumors and normal tissues sensitivity to radiations (such as high LET particles, and altered fractionations).

It is associated with an increased risk of malignancy including intracranial chondrosarcomas. Early diagnosis is crucial; screening patients with Ollier's disease is recommended. The treatment of choice for these intracranial cartilaginous tumours is complete surgical excision but this is often difficult to achieve due to difficult access and relationships with neurovascular structures. An alternative treatment is proton-beam therapy. We report a case of Maffucci's syndrome; illustrating the typical clinical and radiological features as well as the known complications of the condition. [References: 18]

This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy

This work describes an optimized immobilization system for the fractionated treatment of intracranial targets. A study of patient motion demonstrates the high degree of immobilization which is available. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system using dental fixation and a thermoplastic mask that relocates on a rigid frame is described. The design permits scanning studies using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR), conventional photon radiotherapy, and high precision stereotactic proton radiotherapy to be performed with minimal repositioning variation. Studies of both intratreatment motion and daily setup reliability are performed on patients under treatment for paranasal sinus carcinoma. Multiple radiographs taken during single treatments provide the basis for a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis. Additionally, studies of orthogonal radiographs used to setup for proton treatments and verification port films from photon treatments are used to establish day to day patient position variation in routine use. RESULTS: Net 3D patient motion during any treatment is measured to be 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] and rotation about any body axis is 0.14 +/- 0.67 degrees (mean +/- SD). Day-to-day setup accuracy to laser marks is limited to 2.3 mm (mean) systematic error and 1.6 mm (mean) random error. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the most stringent immobilization requirements of 3D conformal radiotherapy adjacent to critical normal structures can be met with a high precision system such as the one described here. Without the use of pretreatment verification, additional developments in machine and couch design are needed to assure that patient repositioning accuracy is comparable to the best level of patient immobility achievable

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

The analysis of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes after irradiation by the accelerated ions 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon and LET 10.7 keV/microm was carried out. Blood samples were irradiated on Nuclotron of the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The doses of irradiation were in the range from 0.05 up to 1.0 Gy. Was shown that the frequency of unstable chromosome aberrations depends from the dose of ionizing radiation and can be described by linear function. At the doses 0.25-0.50 Gy the dose-independent curve was obtained for dicentrics and centric rings. The frequencies of dicentrics and centric rings as markers of the radiation action were slightly different for different donors that could be explained by different radiosensitivity. Using the calibration curve obtained earlier for gamma-rays coefficients of relative biological efficiency of accelerated 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon were defined: they varied from 1.0 at the doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) up to 3.2 at the lower doses (0.05-0.25 Gy)	
0	524	Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification	Algorithms, Calibration, Humans, Ions, Male, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation	The aim of this study was to demonstrate how dosimetry with an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) replaced film and ionization chamber measurements for routine pre-treatment dosimetry in our clinic. Furthermore, we described how EPID dosimetry was used to solve a clinical problem. IMRT prostate plans were delivered to a homogeneous slab phantom. EPID transit images were acquired for each segment. A previously developed in-house back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom mid-plane (intersecting the isocenter). Segment dose images were summed to obtain an EPID mid-plane dose image for each field. Fields were compared using profiles and in two dimensions with the y evaluation (criteria: 3%/3 mm). To quantify results, the average gamma (gamma avg), maximum gamma (gamma max), and the percentage of points with gamma < 1(P gamma < 1) were calculated within the 20% isodose line of each field. For 10 patient plans, all fields were measured with EPID and film at gantry set to 0 degrees. The film was located in the phantom coronal mid-plane (10 cm depth), and compared with the back-projected EPID mid-plane absolute dose. EPID and film measurements agreed well for all 50 fields, with (gamma avg) =0.16, (gamma max)=1.00, and (P gamma < 1)= 100%. Based on these results, film measurements were discontinued for verification of prostate IMRT plans. For 20 patient plans, the dose distribution was re-calculated with the phantom CT scan and delivered to the phantom with the original gantry angles. The planned isocenter dose (plan(iso)) was verified with the EPID (EPID(iso)) and an ionization chamber (IC(iso)). The average ratio, (EPID(iso)/IC(iso)), was 1.00 (0.01 SD). Both measurements were systematically lower than planned, with (EPID(iso)/plan(iso)) and (IC(iso)/plan(iso))=0.99 (0.01 SD). EPID mid-plane dose images for each field were also compared with the corresponding plane derived from the three dimensional (3D) dose grid calculated with the phantom CT scan. Comparisons of 100 fields yielded (gamma avg)=0.39, gamma max=2.52, and (P gamma < 1)=98.7%. Seven plans revealed under-dosage in individual fields ranging from 5% to 16%, occurring at small regions of overlapping segments or along the junction of abutting segments (tongue-and-groove side). Test fields were designed to simulate errors and gave similar results. The agreement was improved after adjusting an incorrectly set tongue-and-groove width parameter in the treatment planning system (TPS), reducing (gamma max) from 2.19 to 0.80 for the test field. Mid-plane dose distributions determined with the EPID were consistent with film measurements in a slab phantom for all IMRT fields. Isocenter doses of the total plan measured with an EPID and an ionization chamber also agreed. The EPID can therefore replace these dosimetry devices for field-by-field and isocenter IMRT pre-treatment verification. Systematic errors were detected using EPID dosimetry, resulting in the adjustment of a TPS parameter and alteration of two clinical patient plans. One set of EPID measurements (i.e., one open and transit image acquired for each segment of the plan) is sufficient to check each IMRT plan field-by-field and at the isocenter, making it a useful, efficient, and accurate dosimetric tool

We compared the actual (clinical) response with the predicted response estimated using our past experimental and clinical data, and discussed some problems to be overcome in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted an intravenous drip infusion of the compound whereby 170 mg/kg of the drug was administered over 4-5 hours before neutron irradiation. The patient was then irradiated with thermal neutrons from the Musashi Reactor at a reactor power of 100 kW and a neutron flux of 1.0 x 10(9) n/cm2/s at the collimator surface. The total absorbed dose to the melanoma and the surrounding skin was calculated by multiplying the thermal neutron fluences by the conversion factor. RESULTS: The total absorbed doses to the melanoma and the surrounding normal skin were calculated as 19.0 and 9.4 Gy, respectively. These absorbed doses were estimated at 33.5 and 14.2 RBE-Gy, respectively, assuming that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the high LET radiations was 2.0 and that each component of the mixed radiation was simply additive. The melanoma showed marked regression with mild skin reaction (dry desquamation) a month after therapy, and finally disappeared 10 months after therapy. There were no no substantial side effects. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the outcome of our calculated dose values agreed well with the clinical response and that their compatibility indicated considerable validity for our approach. However, there are still some problems-uncertainty concerning the 10B concentration in tumor and skin, determination of the total absorbed dose, and a single curative dose for malignant melanoma-to be overcome with regard to clinical use of this therapy

METHODS: Fifteen patients (average age, 48.6 years) with biopsy-proved cervical cancer were included in the study. After clinical staging (FIGO classification), MR imaging with body coil (BCMR) and subsequently with endorectal surface coil (ECMR) was performed. Using a 1.5-Tesla unit, axial and sagittal proton density weighted and spin echo T2-weighted and fast spin echo T2-weighted sequences were obtained with body and endorectal surface coil. During imaging analysis, special attention was paid to the uterine zones, the vaginal fornix, and the parametrial tissue. Ten patients were treated surgically (postsurgical histopathology was considered the gold standard), five patients, all clinically staged IIIb, underwent primary radiation therapy. RESULTS: Clinical staging with FIGO classification was accurate in 12 of 15 patients, and understaged in 2 and overstaged in 1 patient. Body coil MR showed accurate staging in 13 of 15 patients. Using this technique, understaging of 2 patients, both with only minimal tumor infiltration depth (< 8 mm), was performed. Endorectal surface coil MR was accurate in 14 of 15 patients missing minimal parametrial tumor infiltration in 1 patient. Histopathology (n = 10) revealed 3 patients with tumor stage T1b, 2 with stage T2a, and 5 patients with stage T2b. CONCLUSIONS: Although suggested by only a small number of patients, ECMR appears to be the most accurate modality for staging cervical carcinomas but seems to be unreliable in the detection of minimal tumor infiltration

Dosimetric factors are used for prediction of the occurrence of RP after XRT. Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CRT) is a promising modality because of its excellent dose localization and high biological effect on tumors. This study aims to analyze the relationship between dosimetric factors developed for XRT and the incidence of RP in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after CRT. We examined 80 inoperable patients with NSCLC. The ranges of the daily fraction sizes and the total doses were from 3.3 to 8.8 GyE and from 59.4 to 95.4 GyE, respectively. These doses were successfully delivered with acceptable toxicity; >or= grade 2 RP was observed in 8 patients (10%). The severity of RP was graded within 6 months of the initiation of CRT using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. These results indicate the excellent dose distribution of CRT. We then compared the dosimetric data of the 8 patients developed >or= grade 2 RP with those of 72 patients developed <or= grade 1 RP. Dosimetric factors useful for predicting RP in XRT, such as the percentage of the computed tomography-defined total lung volume receiving > 5, > 20, and > 30 GyE, and mean lung dose, were not predictive factors for RP after CRT. The dosimetric factors used for XRT are not applicable for CRT in patients with NSCLC. The dosimetric factors for CRT remain to be developed

We have experimentally investigated the intra-fractional organ motion effects in lung IMRT treatments delivered by multi-leaf collimator (MLC). An in-house made motor-driven platform, which moves sinusoidally with an amplitude of 1 cm and a period of 4 s, was used to mimic tumour motion. Tumour motion was simulated along cranial-caudal direction while MLC leaves moved across the patient from left to right, as in most clinical cases. The dose to a point near the centre of the tumour mass was measured according to geometric and dosimetric parameters from two five-field lung IMRT plans. For each field, measurement was done for two dose rates (300 and 500 MU min(-1)), three MLC delivery modes (sliding window, step-and-shoot with 10 and 20 intensity levels) and eight equally spaced starting phases of tumour motion. The dose to the measurement point delivered from all five fields was derived for both a single fraction and 30 fractions by randomly sampling from measured dose values of each field at different initial phases. It was found that the mean dose to a moving tumour differs slightly (<2-3%) from that to a static tumour. The variation in breathing phase at the start of dose delivery results in a maximum variation around the mean dose of greater than 30% for one field. The full width at half maximum for the probability distribution of the point dose is up to 8% for all five fields in a single fraction, but less than 1-2% after 30 fractions. In general, lower dose rate can reduce the motion-caused dose variation and therefore might be preferable for lung IMRT when no motion mitigation techniques are used.

The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In prostate cancer it is estimated that annually about 300 patients and in gynaecological cancer about 50 patients, are candidates for proton beam therapy. Owing to major uncertainties, it has not been possible to give an estimate of the number of potential patients with urinary bladder cancer. [References: 61]

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs	
0	4057	Comparison of proton and x-ray conformal dose distributions for radiosurgery applications	Biophysics, Boston, Brain, Humans, Massachusetts, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Technology,Radiologic, X-Rays	Highly focused dose distributions for radiosurgery applications are successfully achieved using either multiple static high-energy particle beams or multiple-arc circular x-ray beams from a linac. It has been suggested that conformal x-ray techniques using dynamically shaped beams with a moving radiation source would offer advantages compared to the use of only circular beams. It is also thought that, generally, charged particle beams such as protons offer dose deposition advantages compared to x-ray beams. A comparison of dose distributions was made between a small number of discrete proton beams, multiple-arc circular x-ray beams, and conformal x-ray techniques. Treatment planning of a selection of radiosurgery cases was done for these three techniques. Target volumes ranged from 1.0-25.0 cm3. Dose distributions and dose volume histograms of the target and surrounding normal brain were calculated. The advantages and limitations of each technique were primarily dependent upon the shape and size of the target volume. In general, proton dose distributions were superior to x-ray distributions; both shaped proton and shaped x-ray beams delivered dose distributions which were more conformal than x-ray techniques using circular beams; and the differences between all proton and x-ray distributions were negligible for the smallest target volumes, and greatest for the larger target volumes

[Japanese]	Humans, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Universities	A sensitive strain gauge was used to detect the movement of the chest wall in order to synchronize an irradiation control system with the respiratory cycle. The output timing signal from the system is transferred to the proton accelerator for synchronized irradiation. The timing signal is set during the expiratory phase at a duration of 1.5 to 2 seconds. The efficacy of this method was evaluated by dose volume histogram based on the treatment planning program with CT images. The volume spared by this novel method was calculated in several cases, and results suggest that the method was highly effective

The incidence and severity of anxiety and depression were high in both groups; as radiotherapy continued these symptoms tended to decrease in intensity among the patients treated with the linear accelerator and to increase among the betatron patients. Patients who denied knowledge of their diagnosis were initially less depressed and remained less depressed than those who knew or suspected that they had cancer

After an apparent failure of the tumor to respond, the eye was enucleated. A predominantly epithelioid cell tumor appeared viable by light microscopy, and a low degree of mitotic activity persisted, despite therapy. The tumor cells, however, displayed degenerative changes ultrastructurally, presumably results of the radiotherapy. These consisted of numerous cytoskeletal filaments, lipid vacuoles, prominent phagolysosomes, and nuclear convolutions and fragmentations. The mitochondria were fewer in number in the present tumor than typically encountered in epithelioid cells. A rare leptomeric structure was discovered, probably an organizational modification of the cytoplasmic filaments. The tumor's capillaries showed radiation-induced changes in terms of thickened basement membranes and perivascular fibrin deposition. The foregoing features are indicative of cellular and metabolic injury from the radiotherapy, but these were evidently not sufficiently injurious to sterilize the tumor

No shoulder region was observed in the survival curve of the cells after N-ion irradiation. Ratios of D0 values before and after a 6-hour incubation in plateau phase were 1.1 and 1.8 for N-ion irradiation and gamma-ray irradiation, respectively. The results show that recovery after irradiation with high-LET radiation is slow and much less than after low-LET irradiation

To evaluate the effectiveness of fast neutron therapy, mixed neutron-photon fractionated irradiation, on squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, 98 patients with Stage IIIb disease were examined to study the correlation between local control rate and histological types. The local control rate after neutron-mixed beam therapy was 73%, which decreased to 66% with photon irradiation. The five year survival rate was 49% for patients receiving neutron therapy and 49% for those receiving photon therapy. There was no statistical significance between neutron and photon therapy; we then attempted to analyze histological types to check for any gain using neutron therapy. This study was a nonrandomized trial. The preliminary results however, gave us useful information for the next of neutron therapy

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of 30 patients with unresectable sacral chordomas treated with carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan. Twenty-three patients presented with no prior treatment, and the remaining 7 patients had locally recurrent disease following previous surgical resection. The median clinical target volume was 546 cm(3). The applied carbon ion dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 GyE (gray equivalent, median 70.4) in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 9 to 87 months), 26 patients were still alive and 24 patients remained continuously disease-free. Overall and cause-specific survival rates at 5 years were 52 and 94%, respectively. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 96%. Two patients experienced severe skin/soft tissue complications requiring skin grafts. No other treatment-related surgical interventions, including colostomy or urinary diversion, were carried out. All patients have remained ambulatory and able to stay at home after carbon ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy is effective and safe in the management of patients with unresectable sacral chordomas and offers a promising alternative to surgery

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Iodine 125 plaques were used to treat all uveal melanomas between the end of 1989 and 1991. Since 1991, we have used iodine plaques for small anterior tumors and proton beam for other tumors. We use a plaque with a larger diameter than the tumor diameter (2-4mm) with a dose of 90Gy at the apex. Proton beam therapy is used for all tumors at the equator or posterior to the equator not thicker than 12mm. The dose given is 60Gy cobalt equivalent in four fractions. For each patient, the initial size and location of the tumor were noted as well as the follow-up each year: the outcome for the eye (local recurrence, ocular conservation, and functional results), the occurrence of metastasis, and survival. A statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between December 1989 and September 1998, 1272 patients were treated: 926 (72.8%) were treated with proton beam irradiation and 346 (27.8%) with iodine 125 plaques. The median follow-up was 5 years (60 months). For the patients treated with proton beam therapy, the mean age was 58 years, the tumor location was anterior to the equator for 3.8%, at the equator for 43.6%, and posterior to the equator for 52.6%. The mean tumor diameter was 13.4mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.69mm. For the patients treated with iodine 125 plaques, the mean age was 61.5 years. The location of the tumor was anterior to the equator for 34.4%, at the equator for 46.5%, and posterior to the equator for 19.1%. The mean tumor diameter was 11.5mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.12mm. The recurrence rate was 4% for the proton beam treatment and 3.75% for iodine plaques. There was no statistical difference. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the rate of local recurrence is usually higher with iodine 125 plaques than proton beam therapy. We discuss the risk factors for local recurrence after iodine 125 plaques: tumor diameter, lower dose to the tumor apex and lower dose rate, and posterior location of the tumor. We found a higher mortality rate in patients who presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: When we use iodine 125 plaques for anterior tumors with the proper dose and dose rate to the apex of the tumor, we do not find more recurrence than with proton beam therapy

Heavy charged particle radiotherapy offers the potential advantages of improved dose localization and/or enhanced biologic effect, depending on particle selected for treatment. Target sites have included selected head and neck tumors, ocular melanomata, malignant gliomata of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the stomach, carcinoma of the pancreas, selected juxtaspinal tumors and other locally advanced, unresectable tumors. A Phase III prospective clinical trial has been started in carcinoma of the pancreas using helium ions. Phase I-II studies are underway with heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions in order to prepare for prospective Phase III trials. Silicon ions are also under consideration for clinical trial. These studies are supported by the United States Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health

The complete radiotherapy process using heavy ions was carefully analyzed and divided into three areas related to beam delivery and control, safety-interlock system and medical physics issues. In this paper, the medical physics issues are addressed. Since the irradiation with heavy ions is a nonstandard modality, new concepts and ion specific tests were developed. As far as possible, national and international standard specifications for radiotherapy were adopted. For each aspect, a performance characteristic and a corresponding acceptance test were introduced. In addition, test characteristics for the constancy tests were established. For all tests, intervention thresholds and test frequencies were specified. Using the described protocol of acceptance tests, the commissioning was passed successfully. The heavy ion irradiation facility was approved by the governmental authorities on the basis of these test results. During clinical operation, constancy tests are performed at the beginning of each treatment period, in order to maintain the quality found during the acceptance tests. Up to now, 48 patients have been treated within 6 treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The concepts used and the tests developed for the quality assurance program may serve as an example of how to introduce systematically a quality assurance program for a new treatment modality

The average follow-up period was 18 months. 86% of the treated lesions showed regression at the time of this analysis, and the 14% that did not were followed up for less than a year. Visual acuity remained the same in 47% of the treated eyes, improved in 20%, and deteriorated in 33%. 58% of the treated eyes had visual acuity of 20/100 or better at the last follow-up examination. Radiation vasculopathy with macular oedema was the most common complication, and it was observed in 22% of the treated eyes. These preliminary observations suggest that proton beam irradiation may be a reasonable alternative to enucleation even for this group of choroidal melanomas, which is considered unfavourable in respect of the preservation of visual function

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the frequency of HP dysfunction in adults after RT for nonpituitary brain tumors. METHOD: We studied 56 adult patients who received external beam RT for primary nonpituitary brain tumors at time intervals of 12-150 months after RT. The control group consisted of 20 RT-naive patients with primary brain tumors. GH and adrenal axes were assessed using the insulin tolerance test or the glucagon stimulation test. Gonadotroph, thyrotroph, and lactotroph function were assessed using baseline blood measurements. The biological effective dose (BED) to the HP axis was calculated in the RT patients. RESULTS: Hypopituitarism was present in 41% of patients. The frequency of GH, ACTH, gonadotropin, and TSH deficiencies, and hyperprolactinemia was 32, 21, 27, 9, and 32%, respectively. Any degree of hypopituitarism and GH deficiency was significantly associated with longer time interval from RT and greater BED. However, gonadotropin deficiency and hyperprolactinemia were only related to BED, whereas ACTH deficiency was only significantly associated with the time interval from RT. One RT-naive patient was GH deficient. CONCLUSION: Adult patients treated with cranial irradiation for primary nonpituitary brain tumors are at high risk of hypopituitarism, which is time and dose dependent. Long-term surveillance and periodic evaluation are needed. We recommend that adult late effect clinics, similar to those for children, should be established

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

Thirty-six of 30 patients either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Seventeen of 18 patients followed up for at least one year after therapy demonstrated tumor regression, with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 40%. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged-particle external-beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

First, an analysis of treatment angle combinations for 50 patients treated with conventional conformal radiation therapy is performed. In a second step, nine treatment plans for a hypothetical heavy ion gantry were prepared. Finally, cylindrical projections of the organs at risk are introduced as a tool to analyse the distribution of treatment angles as well as the treatment geometry for each patient. The results of the analysis for conventional therapy clearly show treatment angle combinations that are preferably used. These findings are also supported by the geometrical analysis using the cylindrical projections. The majority of treatment angles for heavy ions also seem to be confined to those regions. In one case, however, the sharp distal dose fall-off of the heavy ions allowed a beam direction outside these conventionally used regions. The advantages of a heavy ion gantry versus a fixed horizontal beam line are shown by comparison of treatment plans for both systems. Treatment angle combinations are suggested that should be accessible for any beam line design using either fixed beams or a gantry

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

We consider the factors influencing the peripheral dose (PD) of 10MV X-ray radiotherapy to be the distance between the caudal edge of the irradiation field and the measuring point, the size of the therapeutic irradiation field, the thickness of the lead shield laid above and lateral to the disease-free testis, and the thickness of the lateral absorber. Materials and methods: We measured the scattering radiation dose coming from the accelerator head and that due to irradiation volume. We measured these doses using a testicular phantom as the non-diseased testis.Results: Scattering radiation from the accelerator head mainly contributes to PD, whereas the larger the size of the irradiation field the more the scattering radiation from the irradiation volume contributed to PD. PD changed more at the surface of the phantom than at its center. PD at the testicular phantom could be reduced to less than 1% of the therapeutic dose when it was situated more than 5cm distant from the caudal limit of the irradiation field, the lead shield above the testicular phantom was 7.5cm thick, and the lateral lead shield was 2mm thick.Conclusions: PD is influenced by many factors. It is necessary to clarify the change in PD at the testicular phantom, and it is important to limit the caudal edge of the irradiation field and to lay the lead shield for the attenuation of radiation on the disease-free testis	
0	653	IMRT with compensators for head-and-neck cancers treatment technique, dosimetric accuracy, and practical experiences.[erratum appears in Strahlenther Onkol. 2005 Dec;181(12):810]	Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Particle Accelerators, Quality Assurance,Health Care, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Reproducibility of Results, Risk, Time, Tonsillar Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With three-dimensional conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy (3D-c-IMRT) a heterogeneous dose distribution can be achieved in both planning treatment volume and in adjacent normal tissues and organs to be spared. 3D-c-IMRT demands for modified photon fluence profiles which can be accomplished with different techniques. This report deals with the commissioning of metal compensators and the first experiences in clinical use. Dosimetric accuracy, dose coverage and practical experience like treatment delivery time, monitor units and dose outside the treated volume are evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to April 2004, 24 patients with head-and-neck cancers were treated with 3D-c-IMRT using tin-wax compensators. The dose prescription included a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB). High-dose volume was irradiated with 60-70 Gy (median 66 Gy), low-dose volume with 48-54 Gy (median 52 Gy) administered by a standardized seven- portal coplanar beam arrangement. Dose at one parotid gland was aimed at 26 Gy. The compensators used consisted of tin granules embedded in wax; recalculation was performed with compensators made of the alloy MCP96 as well. RESULTS: In 21 of 24 patients 3D-c-IMRT with tin-wax compensators reduced the median dose to one parotid gland to < 30 Gy. Recalculation with compensators with higher density which allowed higher attenuation revealed better protection of the parotid gland. The treatment delivery time per fraction was between 6 and 12 min (plus time for patient positioning), approximately 300 MU per 2 Gy were applied. The dose outside the treated volume was increased with regard to open fields and comparable with a physical wedge of 15-30 degrees . Quality assurance and treatment of patient were fast and simple. It was shown, that calculated dose distribution corresponded to measured dose distribution with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: The described method offers facilities for a good dose coverage of irregular target volumes with different prescribed doses and a considerable dose reduction in adjacent organs at risk. The dose sparing of organs at risk can be further improved, if a compensator material with higher density is used

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, base-of-skull sarcomas, low-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and para-nasal sinus tumors. In addition, we have treated bone sarcomas in the neck and trunk--mainly in the sacral area--as well as prostate cases and some soft tissue sarcomas. PTV volumes for our treated cases are in the range 20-4500 ml, indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating lesions of all types and sizes. The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of fluence modulated Bragg peaks delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 000. With the current delivery rate of roughly 3000 Bragg peaks per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to 20-25 min. Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about 10% of delivered spots have a weight of more than 10% of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for optimizing the number of spots delivered per field. Field specific dosimetry shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within +/-1 mm (1 SD) orthogonal to the field direction and to within 1.5 mm in range. With our current delivery system the mean widths of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 mm (sigma) for all energies, indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be made. In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg peaks shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg peaks over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of penetration. This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast re-scanning on second generation scanning gantries	
0	296	A knowledge-based imaging informatics approach for managing proton beam therapy of cancer patients	Brain/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Computational Biology, Elementary Particles/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Knowledge, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Patient Care Planning, Phantoms,Imaging, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Research	The need for a unified patient-oriented information system to handle complex proton therapy (PT) imaging and informatics data during the course of patient treatment is becoming steadily apparent due to the ever increasing demands for better diagnostic treatment planning and more accurate information. Currently, this information is scattered throughout each of the different treatment and information systems in the oncology department. Furthermore, the lack of organization with standardized methods makes it difficult and time-consuming to navigate through the maze of data, resulting in challenges during patient treatment planning. We present a methodology to develop this electronic patient record (ePR) system based on DICOM standards and perform knowledge-based medical imaging informatics research on specific clinical scenarios where patients are treated with PT. Treatment planning is similar in workflow to traditional radiation therapy (RT) methods such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which utilizes a priori knowledge to drive the treatment plan in an inverse manner. In March 2006, two new RT objects were drafted in a DICOM-RT Supplement 102 specifically for ion therapy, which includes PT. The standardization of DICOM-RT-ION objects and the development of a knowledge base as well as decision-support tools that can be add-on features to the ePR DICOM-RT system were researched. This methodology can be used to extend to PT and the development of future clinical decision-making scenarios during the course of the patient's treatment that utilize "inverse treatment planning." We present the initial steps of this imaging and informatics methodology for PT and lay the foundation for development of future decision-support tools tailored to cancer patients treated with PT. By integrating decision-support knowledge and tools designed to assist in the decision-making process, a new and improved "knowledge-enhanced treatment planning" approach can be realized

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and August 1998 we treated 35 patients with stage cT1-3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. Thirty-two patients with a follow-up of 12 to 28 months (median: 18 months) were evaluated. After ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of 4 non-parallel needles, CT based 3D brachytherapy treatment planning ("Offenbach system") was performed. All patients received 4 fractions brachytherapy using a fractional dose of 5 or 7 Gy. Time between each fraction was 14 days. After brachytherapy 3D external irradiation followed up to 39.6 or 45.0 Gy. All patients received androgen deprivation, starting 2 to 19 months before brachytherapy, ending 3 months after 3D external radiotherapy. RESULTS: Posttreatment PSA levels dropped to < 1.5 ng/ml in 29/32 patients (91%). In 25 patients PSA levels were < 0.5 ng/ml, in 4 patients 0.5 to 1.5 ng/ml. In 2 patients we noted biochemical relapse. Transrectal implantation was very well tolerated. Grade 3 acute urinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient. We noted no Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient developed a Grade 3 late urinary toxicity. No patient showed late gastrointestinal side effects. All 140 dose-volume histograms for 3D HDR brachytherapy were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The new 3D HDR brachytherapy technique, combined with 3D external irradiation and androgen deprivation, is a feasible, so far well-tolerated and effective treatment in the short-time follow-up of median 18 months

Total body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The irradiation technique with 4 MV X-rays is described. The patients are treated without lung-shieldings. The dose-measurements show an acceptable homogeneity. The applied technique is very easy in comparison with other centers. A main point is making the patient's position as comfortable as possible. The accuracy of dose-application and dose-distribution is considered clinically acceptable

Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans

It can be a very useful complement of traditional microsurgery, pharmacotherapy or fractionated radiotherapy which are seldom a sufficient treatment on their own. The modern radiosurgery does not offer the experience representative enough in this indication. We can offer results of medium long follow-up for tumor growth and hormonal hypersecretion of pituitary adenomas in a relatively large series of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analyzed a group of 163 patients with pituitary adenoma treated with gamma knife during 5 years and followed 12-60 months, median 24 months after irradiation. An antiproliferative effect has been achieved in 1-2 years using the minimal dose to the margin 16-35 Gy, median 20 Gy in all our patients who were controlled by MRI (n = 126 patients). One half of these adenomas evidently decreased their size. Our effective antiproliferative dose was safe for the surrounding structures. The hormonal normalization has been achieved at 50.4% from 133 hypersecreting adenomas (39/91 = 43% of acromegalics, 11/13 = 85% of patients with Cushing's disease, 2/9 = 22% of patients with Nelson's syndrome, 11/18 = 61% of prolactinomas). The median latency was 12 months. The minimal dose to the margin was 10-45 Gy, median 35 Gy. Rare side effects were provoked only by increasing the dose to influence the hypersecretion-the development of partial hypopituitarism in 3.1% of patients, the panhypopituitarism in 0.6% of patient and there was 1 hemianopic visual field defect (0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery by gamma knife has a similar value for pituitary adenomas as microsurgery has with different distribution of advantages and drawbacks. This makes it suitable for the combined treatment where pharmacotherapy has its place under special conditions. Fractionated radiotherapy has now a marginal importance

As examples of such contribution, radiobiologically-elaborated continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) has been proven to be superior to conventional radiotherapy against non-small cell lung cancer, and a hypoxic cell sensitizer nimorazole has been proven to be effective against pharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal cancers. Based on laboratory studies, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone in many cancers. Radiation biology has also provided important fundamental data for clinical applications of heavy ion and proton beam therapy. In the future, useful predictive assays and radioprotectors are also expected to be developed. Radiation biology should continue to contribute to the further development of clinical radiation therapy. [References: 13]

The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a radiotherapy technique that uses linear accelerators with multileaf collimators to treat the pelvis and sequentially boost the inguinal regions, while minimizing "hot spots" across the match-line. This was achieved by angling the gantry for the inguinal fields so that their medial borders aligned with the divergence of the posterior pelvic field. Film dosimetry was performed to compare the MSBT with the traditional segmental boost technique, partial transmission block, and photon/electron combination techniques. These treatment techniques were scored on the basis of the dose homogeneity index, defined as the ratio of match-line maximum dose to the average dose at a given depth in the groin treatment area. RESULTS: The values of the dose homogeneity index were the same (1.04) for MSBT and partial transmission block, and 1.21, 1.39, and 1.18 for the segmental boost technique, photon pelvis with electron tags, and photon pelvis with electron boost, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MSBT proved to be technically simple while optimizing dose homogeneity compared with the other techniques and allows for maximum use of the features of modern linear accelerators

1	4084	Advanced prostate cancer: the results of a randomized comparative trial of high dose irradiation boosting with conformal protons compared with conventional dose irradiation using photons alone.[see comment]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Arm, Boston, Clinical Protocols, Cobalt, Data Interpretation,Statistical, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pc [Prevention & Control], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prospective Studies, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectum, Research, Survival, Urethral Stricture/et [Etiology], Urethral Stricture/su [Surgery], Urinary Bladder Diseases/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: Following a thorough Phase I/II study, we evaluated by a Phase III trial high versus conventional dose external beam irradiation as mono-therapy for patients with Stage T3-T4 prostate cancer. Patient outcome following standard dose radiotherapy or following a 12.5% increase in total dose to 75.6 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) using a conformal perineal proton boost was compared for local tumor control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stage T3-T4, Nx, N0-2, M0 patients received 50.4 Gy by four-field photons and were randomized to receive either an additional 25.2 CGE by conformal protons (arm 1--the high dose arm, 103 patients, total dose 75.6 CGE) or an additional 16.8 Gy by photons (arm 2--the conventional dose arm, 99 patients, total dose 67.2 Gy). Actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), total recurrence-free survival (TRFS), (clinically free, prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 4ng/ml and a negative prostate rebiopsy, done in 38 patients without evidence of disease) and local control (digital rectal exam and rebiopsy negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 90% for arm 1 and 97% for arm 2. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range 3 to 139 months) 135 patients are alive and 67 have died, 20 from causes other than prostate cancer. We found no significant differences in OS, DSS, TRFS or local control between the two arms. Among those completing randomized treatment (93 in arm 1 and 96 in arm 2), the local control at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 92% and 77%, respectively and is 80% and 60%, respectively for arm 2 (p = .089) and there are no significant differences in OS, DSS, and TRFS. The local control for the 57 patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason 4 or 5 of 5) tumors at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 94% and 84% and is 64% and 19% on arm 2 (p = 0.0014). In patients whose digital rectal exam had normalized following treatment and underwent prostate rebiopsy there was a lower positive rebiopsy rate for arm 1 versus arm 2 patients (28 vs. 45%) and also for those with well and moderately differentiated tumors versus poorly differentiated tumors (32 and 50%). These differences were not statistically significant. Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding is higher (32 vs. 12%, p = 0.002) as may be urethral stricture (19 vs. 8%, p = 0.07) in the arm 1 versus arm 2. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in prostate tumor dose by external beam of 12.5% to 75.6 CGE by a conformal proton boost compared to a conventional dose of 67.2 Gy by a photon boost significantly improved local control only in patients with poorly differentiated tumors. It has increased late radiation sequelae, and as yet, has not increased overall survival, disease-specific survival, or total recurrence-free survival in any subgroup. These results have led us to test by a subsequent Phase III trial the potential beneficial effect on local control and disease-specific survival of a 12.5% increase in total dose relative to conventional dose in patients with T1, T2a, and T2b tumors

[German]	Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Humans, Leukemia,Myeloid,Acute/th [Therapy], Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Particle Accelerators, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Risk, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Whole-Body Irradiation	The described whole-body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with acute myeloic leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The patient is irradiated with equal doses from the right and the left side. So a dose of 10 Gy in the middle of the body is achieved which is determined individually by means of phantom measurements. In order to avoid the risk of an interstitial pneumonitis, the lung region is temporarily blinded in such a way that a dose of 8 Gy is obtained there in the middle of the body. During the irradiations, the accumulated dose is measured in different body regions with thermoluminescence dosimeters, a semi-conductor diode and, eventually, a ionization chamber. The scattering width is +/- 13%. We do our best to make the patient's position as comfortable as possible

In the case of proton therapy, secondary neutrons generated in the accelerator head and inside the patient reach many areas in the patient body. Due to the improved efficacy of management of cancer patients, the number of long term survivors post-radiation treatment is increasing substantially. This results in concern about the risk of radiation-induced cancer appearing at late post-treatment times. This paper presents a case study to determine the effective dose from secondary neutrons in patients undergoing proton treatment. A whole-body patient model, VIP-Man, was employed as the patient model. The geometry dataset generated from studies made on VIP-Man was implemented into the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code. Two proton treatment plans for tumours in the lung and paranasal sinus were simulated. The organ doses and ICRP-60 radiation and tissue weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. Results show whole body effective doses for the two proton plans of 0.162 Sv and 0.0266 Sv, respectively, to which the major contributor is due to neutrons from the proton treatment nozzle. There is a substantial difference among organs depending on the treatment site

METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention	
0	3737	The influence of field size, treatment modality, commissure involvement and histology in the treatment of early vocal cord cancer with irradiation	Adult, Aged, Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Smoking, Survival, Time, Vocal Cords	One hundred and thirty-seven patients with TNM staged T1 glottic cancer were treated from 1966 to 1980. The patient characteristics were no different from those noted in previous studies. Patients were treated either with 60Co teletherapy units or 4 MeV linear accelerators with different daily (180-225) and weekly (4 times vs. 5 times) fractionation schemes. A recurrent-free survival was attained in 80% of the patients 2 years after primary treatment with radiation therapy. There were 27 local recurrences, of which 82% were salvaged with surgery for an overall adjusted survival of 95%. Patients treated on 60Co units with field sizes less than or equal to 30 sq. cm had a 15% increase in local recurrence compared with field size greater than 30 sq. cm, which could not be attributed to lower doses. Poorly differentiated tumors and those involving the anterior commissure were more likely to develop a local recurrence. Doses above 1900 ret were associated with a decrease in local recurrence in patients having anterior commissure involvement. Salvage with limited surgery for failure was effective in selected cases

Patients were followed for eighteen to forty-five months with regard to progression of disease and development of long-term complications. Upstaging to Stage D1 by virtue of discovering pelvic node involvement was noted in 16 patients (53.3 per cent). Subsequent disease progression (defined as development of bone or soft tissue metastasis) was seen in 9 of 16 upstaged patients with an average time to progression of 12.2 months. Three Stage D1 patients have died with an average time to death of 19.6 months. Only 1 patient whose lymphadenectomy was negative has experienced disease progression, and none has died. Adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride) was given to 9 upstaged patients, in only 3 did disease progress. In contrast, in 6 of 7 upstaged patients not receiving chemotherapy metastatic disease developed, with an average time to progression of 10.3 months. In an attempt to improve local tumor control achieved by interstitial irradiation alone, 18 patients received additional external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, in doses ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 rad. There were sixteen long-term complications in the 30 patients, 75 per cent of which were seen in patients receiving added external beam irradiation	
1	3649	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: probability of eye retention after proton treatment	Actuarial Analysis, Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immunotherapy, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Risk, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Enucleation was performed after proton treatment in 57 of 1006 (5.7%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986. Only 2% of 99 patients with small tumors and 4% of 566 patients with intermediate size tumors underwent enucleation after treatment; 10% of 341 patients with large tumors lost the treated eye. No eyes were removed after 52 months, with 89% of enucleations performed during the first 36 months after treatment. Eye retention rates at 60 months were 89.1 +/- 3.0% for the entire group, and 97 +/- 3.7%, 92.7 +/- 3.1%, and 78.3 +/- 7.0% in patients with small, intermediate, and large tumors, respectively. Significantly greater enucleation rates were observed in patients with large tumors than in those with intermediate tumors (p = less than .0001), in patients with tumor height greater than 8 mm relative to those with tumors less than or equal to 8 mm, p = (less than .0001), with tumor diameter greater than 16 mm compared to less than or equal to 16 mm, (p = less than .0001), and with tumor involvement of the ciliary body compared to involvement of the choroid only (p = less than .0001). Possible strategies to decrease the likelihood of enucleation in patients at apparently increased risk of losing the eye after conservative therapy, that is, those with large tumors involving the ciliary body, might include a lower total dose, a more protracted treatment course, or a lower radiation dose and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with hyperthermia, or with other radiation sensitizers

The theoretical considerations about the clinical advantages this treatment modality can yield and the results obtained at the centers where it has already been used justify the proposal to project a center of this kind also in our Country. To this purpose, two of the authors of this paper (U. Amaldi, G. Tosi) founded the TERA Group formed by physicists, engineers and radiotherapists who work in close collaboration on a feasibility study for a hadrontherapy facility. The first aim of the Hadrontherapy Project is to design a center equipped with a synchrotron which, at the beginning, will accelerate negative hydrogen ions (H-) which will first produce 70-250 MeV proton beams and, then accelerate light ions (up to 16O) to 430 MeV/amu. This accelerator will serve four or five treatment rooms where patients can be irradiated simultaneously. Two rooms will be equipped with a fixed horizontal beam for the treatment of eye, head and neck tumors; the others will be equipped with rotating gantries to administer, in any clinical situation, really adequate treatment. Such a unit, when enough experience is fained, will allow at least 1000 patients to be treated yearly. The synchrotron injector will be designed so as to allow, parallel to the radiotherapy activities, other applications of medical and biological interest such as: the production of radioisotopes for diagnostic use (especially positron emitters), the analysis of trace elements through the PIXE technique and the production of thermal and epithermal neutrons for boron neutron capture therapy.

[Review] [61 refs] [French]	Combined Modality Therapy, Electrons, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, France, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neutrons, Photons, Probability, Radiation, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Salivary Gland Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival	If low LET radiation therapy (photons, electrons), following radical microscopically and complete surgery can improve results in term of local control from 34 to 74% for salivary gland tumors, local control is more difficult to achieve in advanced tumors and only palliative treatment is usually attempted. In this survey, all the patient series treated worldwide were reviewed. They show an overall control rate of 31% with photon vs 64% with neutron therapy. A prospective randomised trial sponsored by the RTOG and the MRC published in 1988 and reviewed in 1993 showed an overall locoregional complete tumor clearance of 67% for neutrons and 17% for photons (P < 0.005), with 68% and 25% survival at two years for neutrons and photons respectively. This study was closed for ethical reasons. In Orleans, since 1987, 59 patients have been treated. At five years the persistent local control probability was 69.5%, the five-year crude survival probability 66% and the five-year tumor free survival probability was 64.5%. This review provides evidence that surgical treatment for salivary gland tumors should be limited to patients presenting a high likelihood of negative surgical margin and a small risk of facial nerve damage. Others patients should receive neutron radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment. [References: 61]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 394 1H MR spectra were acquired from 100 patients (age 19-74 years; mean and median age, 43 years) before and during 2 years after radiation therapy (the mean absorbed doses calculated for the averaged spectroscopy voxels are similar and close to 20 Gy). RESULTS: Oscillations were observed in choline-containing compounds (Cho)/creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and center of gravity (CG) of the lipid band in the range of 0.7-1.5 ppm changes over time reveal oscillations. The parameters have the same 8-month cycle period; however the CG changes precede the other by 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the oscillative nature of the brain response to irradiation, which may be caused by the blood-brain barrier disruption and repair processes. These oscillations may influence the NMR results, depending on the cycle phase in which the NMR measurements are performed in. The earliest manifestation of radiation injury detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the CG shift	
0	3260	Photoneutrons from high energy medical linear accelerators: measurement of the spectrum and dose using a miniature proportional counter	Humans, Methods, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Pressure, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: A new method of measuring photoneutron dose to the patient during treatment with high energy photon or electron beams is presented. This method has the advantage of providing not only the dose, but the microdosimetric spectrum at the same time. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A miniature cylindrical gas proportional counter (0.5 mm diameter by 0.5 mm height) has been used to measure scatter radiation from a 20 MV teletherapy photon beam. At atmospheric pressure, filled with propane base tissue equivalent gas, this counter simulates a unit density tissue region of approximately 0.9 microns. We present here single event microdosimetric spectra measured outside the primary beam 1.4 m from the target. This technique allows a single measurement to determine the scattered dose due to gammas and photoneutron contamination, as well as the quality factor of the photoneutrons. RESULTS: Spectral components from scattered photons and the photoneutrons are easily separated, and dose contributions can be estimated. The ratio of photoneutron dose measured by the proportional counter to photon dose at isocenter is 0.75 x 10(-4). CONCLUSIONS: Neutron dose was also measured using a bubble neutrometer. The proportional counter and neutrometer agree within experimental errors. This type of instrument is shown to be a viable technique for determination of exposure of patient and also personnel to photoneutrons, providing not only a dose determination, but also a spectrum that can be used to estimate quality factors for equivalent dose. Its main drawback is that it requires a lengthy (several hours) measurement because of low count rate of the neutrons

This characteristic is known for charged particle beams. In a field study based on German cooperative trials, the possibility of a charged particle radiotherapy to retroperitoneal tumors of childhood will be discussed regarding indications in risk groups and recurrences. Absolute patient numbers are estimated from the clinical experiences and the incidences of the diseases. A stepwise introduction of this new therapy modality is proposed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as "primary tumors" and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66.6 or 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group #85-26) with conventional fractionation (1.8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and those of a group of 33 patients with no clinical or MRI evidence of injury. Dose distributions were calculated and dose-volume histograms were obtained for these patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 developed TL damage, with bilateral injury in 2 and unilateral injury in 8. The cumulative TL damage incidence at 2 and 5 years was 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. The MRI areas suggestive of TL damage were always separated from the tumor bed. Symptoms were severe to moderate in 8 patients. Several baseline factors, tumor- or host-related, were analyzed to evaluate their predictivity for TL damage: age, gender, tumor site, histology, type of presentation, type and number of surgical procedures, primary tumor volume, prescribed dose, normal tissue involvement, and volume of TL receiving doses ranging between 10 and 50 CGE or more. Only gender, in a univariate analysis (log rank) was a significant predictor of damage (0.0155), with male patients being at significantly higher risk of TL injury. In a stepwise Cox regression that included gender as a variable, no other baseline variable improved the prediction of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The 2- and 5-year cumulative TL damage rates were 7.6 and 13.2%, respectively. Despite the different TL damage rates related to age, tumor volume, number of surgical procedures prior to radiation therapy, and prescribed doses to the tumor, only gender was a significant predictor of damage (p = 0.0155) using a univariate (log rank) test. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull may represent an interesting model to evaluate the TL damage rates because of their extradural origin, displacing the white matter instead of infiltrating it as gliomas do, because of their longer local recurrence-free survival other than gliomas and other brain tumors and because of the high doses of irradiation delivered to the target volume to obtain local control	
0	2667	Execution of a single-isocenter three-field technique, using a multileaf collimator or tray-mounted cerrobend blocks: effect on treatment time	Axilla, Belgium, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Computer Simulation, Female, Humans, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, Time, Time Factors, Universities	PURPOSE: In this article, we studied the total treatment time of a single-isocenter three-field irradiation of breast and axilla, using either tray-mounted cerrobend blocks, or a multileaf collimator (MLC) for field shaping. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 20 female, unselected patients were given 50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) on breast and 46 Gy on axilla and supraclavicular region (2 Gy/fraction). Patients were randomized between two different treatment groups. The first group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-75 linear accelerator (SL-75), using 5 MV photons with tray-mounted cerrobend blocks. The second group (n = 10) was treated on a Philips SL-25 linear accelerator, using 6 MV photons and a MLC (SL-25-MLC). RESULTS: Although the beam-on time on the SL-25-MLC was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to the SL-75, overall treatment time was significantly shorter using a MLC instead of tray-mounted cerrobend blocks (p < 0.0001). The difference in total treatment time was in the range of 100 s per patient per day. The main difference between the two accelerators was observed when setup of the second and third field was done using the automatic setup facility of the SL-25-MLC (avoids entering the treatment room). A mean time gain of 124 s per treatment session was observed using automatic setup. Considering the yearly number of patients receiving this treatment, a total time gain equivalent to 16.15 8-h workdays was calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a technique using tray-mounted cerrobend blocks in the single-isocenter three-field irradiation of a breast and axilla, a MLC combined with automatic field setup provides a significant time advantage, by reducing the number of manipulations inside the treatment room

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles

The results of a study are presented showing how detailed diagnostic information available from MRI is helpful in defining the target volume to be irradiated and the critical normal structures. By using 3-dimensional planning techniques, an assessment was made of the relative merits of proton beam therapy and of X ray treatment for patients with early stage and locally advanced carcinoma of the nasopharynx. For both types of patient, the study suggests that the use of protons for the major part of treatment results in a more even distribution of dose to the tumor and an increase of approximately 5 Gy in median tumor dose with substantial reductions in doses to adjacent normal tissues. The superior dose distributions possible with protons should translate into improved local control and reduced morbidity. The difficulties of proton treatment planning for this site are addressed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2). Grade 3 late toxicity occurred in 1 patient (1.9%) only. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT is an effective treatment for low- and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base offering high local control rates with low toxicity	
1	4324	Dose volume histogram analysis of liver radiation tolerance	Helium, Humans, Ions, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/pc [Prevention & Control], Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Liver/re [Radiation Effects], Neon, Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Patient Care Planning, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	Eleven patients with carcinoma of the pancreas or biliary system received heavy charged particle radiation treatments and whole liver heavy charged particle radiation at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22). When BNCT is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA and radiobiological considerations, promising clinical results have been obtained, although many problems and issues remain to be solved

It included irradiation of the bed of tumor removed. Fast electron beam was produced by a small betatron (collimator size--5 x 6 cm and 8 x 12 cm) installed in the operating room. Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

Group I (194 patients) was given a combination of proton irradiation of the pituitary and sequential zone gamma-ray teletherapy of the skeleton, group II (98) received the first component and group III (162 cases)--the latter component of the modality only. Cumulative survival curves for groups I and II were well approximated by exponential function of the follow-up period; mean survival was 36.4 and 11.4 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. Within a period of about 12 months, survival curves for groups I and III were nearly identical. However, with the increasing number of bony metastases, the group III curve slope tended to match that of group II. Corresponding mean survival for that segment of the curve was 13 months. Mean survival for historic control was 12.1 months. Thus, pronounced and lasting increase in survival was not observed unless the procedures were used together

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A system for the exchange of radiotherapy data between different commercial planning systems and a specially developed planning system for proton therapy has been developed through the use of the PAPYRUS diagnostic image standard as an intermediate format. To ensure the cooperation of the different TPS manufacturers, the number of data sets defined for transfer has been restricted to the three core data sets of CT, VOIs, and three-dimensional dose distributions. As a complement to the exchange of data, network-wide application-sharing (video-conferencing) technologies have been adopted to provide methods for the interactive discussion and assessment of treatments plans with one or more partner clinics. RESULTS: Through the use of evaluation plans based on the exchanged data, referring clinics can accurately assess the advantages offered by proton therapy on a patient-by-patient basis, while the practicality or otherwise of the proposed treatments can simultaneously be assessed by the proton therapy center. Such a system, along with the interactive capabilities provided by video-conferencing methods, has been found to be an efficient solution to the problem of patient assessment and selection at a specialized treatment center, and is a necessary first step toward the full electronic integration of such centers with their remotely situated referral centers

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose-volume histograms were compared between photon, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton plans at doses of 66 Gy, 87.5 Gy in Stage I (n=10) and 60-63 Gy, and 74 Gy in Stage III (n=15). RESULTS: For Stage I, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 31.8%, 24.6%, and 15.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 66 Gy, whereas they were 13.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, with proton with dose escalation to 87.5 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (p=0.002). For Stage III, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 54.1%, 46.9%, and 34.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 63 Gy, whereas they were 39.7%, 36.6%, and 31.6%, respectively, for proton with dose escalation to 74 CGE (p=0.002). In all cases, the doses to lung, spinal cord, heart, esophagus, and integral dose were lower with proton therapy even compared with IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation, compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT

METHODS: Among 249 patients with proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma, the authors identified 59 patients who had visual-field testing performed before treatment and at least 18 months after treatment. The visual fields, color fundus photographs, and charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of radiation papillopathy and visual-field loss after treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 59 patients reviewed (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of radiation papillopathy. Progressive visual-field loss, defined as enlargement of absolute scotoma of greater than [corrected] or equal to 30 degrees as compared with the pretreatment visual field, was noted in 67% of patients with radiation papillopathy and 73% of patients without papillopathy. In both groups, visual-field loss correlated with the area of the retina predicted to be exposed to irradiation in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive visual-field loss is common after proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma. However, the scotoma usually correlates with the area of the retina exposed to irradiation. The development of radiation papillopathy does not appear to be associated with additional visual-field defects in most cases

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT	
0	4654	Update on radiation therapy in prostate cancer. [Review] [88 refs]	Brachytherapy, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Patient Selection, Patients, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time	Higher doses of radiation result in improved clinical control of prostate cancer,and the recent advances in prostate cancer radiotherapy are designed to escalate dose while minimizing toxicity. To achieve this goal, tighter treatment margins are needed, which require more accurate delineation of the prostate target and normal tissue at the time of treatment planning and before actual daily treatments. Modem radiation therapy techniques can deposit conformal dose virtually anywhere in the body; however, this precise therapy is of no value if it is not accurately hitting the target. Whether dose escalation is achieved by external beam techniques (eg, IMRT, protons) or brachytherapy, these ba-sic planning and delivery considerations are essentially the same. Future directions in prostate radiation therapy will use even higher radiation doses,alternative fractionation patterns, intraprostatic targets (eg, prostate tumor seen on MRI), and improved patient selection regarding which patients will benefit the most from these advanced techniques.

This paper will discuss proton treatment in general, treatment planning procedures, and results to date in major patient categories. 846 patients have been treated with fractionated proton therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron, with normal tissue and tumor responses consistent with an RBE of 1.1 for the proton beam. Proton beam therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with uveal melanomas, and chordomas and chondrosarcomas involving the skull base and cervical spine. Improved dose distribution possible with protons have allowed greater doses than are given conventionally to be delivered to patients with prostatic carcinoma, head and neck malignancies, ano-rectal cancers, and retroperitoneal tumors. Doses employed have been usually 10 to 20% greater than normally would be delivered in our department to such tumors. Generally, local control rates have been good

The treatment is based on a versatile, non-invasive interface for stereotactic localization of the brain target imaged by computed tomography (CT), angiography or magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), and subsequent repetitive stereotactic irradiation of the target using a linear accelerator. The fractionation of the stereotactic irradiation was intended to meet the requirements of the basic principles of radiobiology. The radiophysical evaluation using phantoms, and the clinical results in a small number of patients, demonstrated a good reproducibility between repeated positionings of the target in the isocenter of the accelerator, and a high degree of accuracy in the treatment of brain lesions

METHODS: Retrospective review of 78 patients with 60 medium and 18 large-size choroidal melanomas at a median follow-up of 34 months. RESULTS: The 5-year data for local control, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were estimated to be 90.5 +/- 3.7%, 76.2 +/- 6.7%, and 75.6 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Eye preservation was achieved in 75.3% of patients, with useful (better than 20/200) visual acuity (VA) in 49.1% of surviving patients. Both local failure and complications led to enucleation. Prognosticators were tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.003), large tumors involving the ciliary body (p = 0.041), and local failure (p < 0.001). Prognostic factors for VA following PRT were initial VA (p = 0.001), doses to optic disc (p = 0.001) and fovea (p = 0.022) higher than 35 CGE (Cobalt Gray equivalent), tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.034), and retinal detachment (p < 0.001). Tumor basis diameter was significantly related to metastases free survival (p = 0.02), overall survival (p = 0.033), and disease specific survival (p = 0.017), but did not impair local tumor control, rate of enucleation, and VA. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that PRT is an effective and safe treatment for medium and large size choroidal melanoma. PRT can preserve the eye and its function in a reasonable percentage of patients. Further evaluation in controlled clinical trials comparing PRT to plaque radiotherapy and enucleation is required

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1993 and 2004, 88 patients with iris melanoma received proton beam radiotherapy, with 53.1 Gy in 4 fractions. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 52 years and a median follow-up of 2.7 years. The tumors had a median diameter of 4.3 mm, involving more than 2 clock hours of iris in 32% of patients and more than 2 hours of angle in 27%. The ciliary body was involved in 20%. Cataract was present in 13 patients before treatment and subsequently developed in another 18. Cataract had a 4-year rate of 63% and by Cox analysis was related to age (p = 0.05), initial visual loss (p < 0.0001), iris involvement (p < 0.0001), and tumor thickness (p < 0.0001). Glaucoma was present before treatment in 13 patients and developed after treatment in another 3. Three eyes were enucleated, all because of recurrence, which had an actuarial 4-year rate of 3.3% (95% CI 0-8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma is well tolerated, the main problems being radiation-cataract, which was treatable, and preexisting glaucoma, which in several patients was difficult to control

Although there are many reports concerning the tolerance of the CNS, few have examined individual substructures of the brain and fewer still have had detailed dose information. This study has both. A three dimensional planning system was used to develop the combined proton beam/photon beam treatments for 27 patients with skull-base tumors. The cranial nerves and their related nuclei were delineated on the planning CT scans and the radiation dose to each was determined from three dimensional dose distributions. In the 594 CNS structures (22 structures/patient in 27 patients), there have been 17 structures (in 5 patients) with clinically manifest radiation injury, after a mean follow-up time of 74 months (range 40-110 months). From statistical analyses, dose is found to be a significant predictor of injury. Using logistic regression analysis, we find that, for each cranial nerve, at 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) the complication rate is 1% (0.5-3% with 95% confidence) and that the 5% complication rate occurs at 70 CGE (64-81 CGE with 95% confidence). The slope of the dose response curve (at 50%) is 3.2 (2.2-5.4 with 95% confidence). No significant relationship between dose and latency period for nerve injury was found

In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression

[Review] [64 refs]	Androgen Antagonists/tu [Therapeutic Use], Biopsy, California, Californium, Cryosurgery, Forecasting, Humans, Male, Methods, Patient Selection, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Radiation, Treatment Outcome, Universities	OBJECTIVES: To summarize improvements in patient selection and the results of focal therapy for the management of localized prostate cancer. METHODS: A contemporary series of patients managed with wide surgical excision, radiation therapy (three-dimensional conformal radiation, interstitial radiation, and charged-particle or proton therapy), and cryo-therapy were reviewed. RESULTS: We used preoperative cancer grade, transrectal ultrasound, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in all patients, and cross-sectional imaging and bone scans in selected patients to allow for reasonably accurate cancer staging and selection of patients most likely to be cured by radical prostatectomy or radiation. In patients with extracapsular extension of prostate cancer, wide surgical excision and achievement of a clear surgical margin had therapeutic value. Newer radiation techniques resulted in a higher likelihood of prostate cancer control than previous techniques. Cryotherapy for patients with stages T1 through 3 prostate cancer was associated with a posttreatment undetectable PSA rate of 48% and a positive biopsy rate of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with organ-confined and, therefore, curable prostate cancer can be identified. Well-performed radical prostatectomy, radiation, and cryotherapy are alternative treatments for the management of localized prostate cancer. [References: 64]

[Japanese]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cancer Care Facilities, Carbon, Female, Head, Humans, Japan, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostate, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Safety, Treatment Outcome	The Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center(HIBMC) is a hospital-based charged particle treatment facility. Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

Tumors were irradiated with 2,500 rad at each of four to five sessions, with an interval of one to two days between sessions. The melanomas ranged in diameter from 8 to 20 mm and were from 3.0 to 13.7 mm in thickness. Patients were followed up for three months to seven years. In 11 cases, the tumor was fully resorbed. Complications included radiation cataract, postradiation glaucoma, radiation retinopathy, and exudative retinal detachment. In 12 cases, enucleation was performed because tumor growth persisted. Four patients died during follow-up period because of metastasis. The eye was preserved in 47 cases

METHODS: Retrospective review of the charts of patients with iris melanoma treated by proton beam therapy between April 1998 and September 2002. Ciliary body melanomas with iris involvement or tumours with extrascleral invasion were excluded. Treatment consisted of 60 Gy of proton beam irradiation delivered in four fractions to the tumour volume. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated, median follow-up of 33 months (8-72 months). 15 patients presented a lesion with documented growth. The median clinical diameter was 5 mm (2-8 mm), the median ultrasound diameter 4.8 mm (2-7.7 mm) The patients were 6% T1, 57.1% T2, and 14.3% T3 all N0M0. The iridocorneal angle was invaded by the tumour in 71.4% of patients. At the end of follow-up, all patients were alive with no proven metastatic disease except one patient with suspicious liver lesions. None of the patients showed tumour progression or ocular relapse. The tumour response at 2 years was a flat lesion for 6.3% of cases, partial regression in 75% and stable in 18.8%. None of the patients required secondary enucleation. The main complication was cataract (45% within 24 months of treatment). Raised intraocular pressure was observed in 15% of patients but no neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy shows potential utility for selected cases of localised iris melanomas allowing excellent local tumour control and eye preservation. Further follow-up on larger series is needed to confirm these results

This inhomogeneous spatial distribution of lesions can be visualized indirectly and rapidly in the form of radiation-induced foci using immunocytochemical detection or GFP-tagged DNA repair proteins. To analyze faster protein translocations and a possible contribution of radiation-induced chromatin movement in DNA damage recognition in live cells, we developed a remote-controlled system to obtain high-resolution fluorescence images of living cells during ion irradiation with a frame rate of the order of seconds. Using scratch replication labeling, only minor chromatin movement at sites of ion traversal was observed within the first few minutes of impact. Furthermore, time-lapse images of the GFP-coupled DNA repair protein aprataxin revealed accumulations within seconds at sites of ion hits, indicating a very fast recruitment to damaged sites. Repositioning of the irradiated cells after fixation allowed the comparison of live cell observation with immunocytochemical staining and retrospective etching of ion tracks. These results demonstrate that heavy-ion radiation-induced changes in subnuclear structures can be used to determine the kinetics of early protein recruitment in living cells and that the changes are not dependent on large-scale chromatin movement at short times postirradiation	
1	4151	Applications of asymmetric collimation on linear accelerators	California, Californium, Cohort Studies, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Universities	Frequency of use of asymmetric collimation (AC) at an academic radiation oncology center equipped with AC-capable linear accelerators was determined, and the type of use was cataloged. Records of patients beginning radiation treatment at U.C. Davis Cancer Center within a 3-month period (3/1/92 to 5/31/92) were reviewed. Forty-seven percent of 102 patients and 56% of 123 courses of treatment involved AC. Six common uses of AC were identified: beam-split field matching, planned boosts, other field size changes, adjustments to match divergent fields, matchline feathering, and opposed tangential fields. This study demonstrates that asymmetric collimation is a useful and powerful clinical treatment tool with widespread applications to radiation therapy

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers

Patient-related, disease-related, and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991. Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19 children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36 children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size, or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach

Protons offer an opportunity to increase the radiation dose to the prostate while minimizing treatment toxicity. METHODS: Six hundred forty-three patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons, with or without photons. Treatments were planned with a 3D planning system; patients received 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE per fraction. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The overall clinical disease-free survival rate was 89% at 5 years. When post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as an endpoint for disease control, the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for patients with an initial PSA of < 4.0 ng/ml, and 89%, 72%, and 53% for patients with initial PSA levels of 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and > 20.0, respectively. Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91%, 79%, and 40%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels. A prospective randomized dose-escalation trial is now underway to help define the optimum dose of radiation for patients with early stage prostate cancer	
0	2642	The effect of patient motion on dose uncertainty in charged particle irradiation for lesions encircling the brain stem or spinal cord	Biophysics, Brain, Brain Stem, California, Californium, Central Nervous System Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Ganglioneuroma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Humans, Ions, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uncertainty, Universities	A specialized charged-particle radiotherapy technique developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) is applied to patients with lesions abutting or surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. This technique divides the target into two parts, one partially surrounding the critical structure (brain stem or spinal cord) and a second excluding the critical structure and abutting the first portion of the target. Compensators are used to conform the dose distribution to the distal surface of the target. This technique represents a novel approach in treating unresectable or residual tumors surrounding the spinal cord or brain stem. Since the placement of the patient with respect to beam-shaping devices is critical for divided-target treatments, a method for calculating dose distributions reflecting random patient motion is proposed, and the effects of random patient motion are studied for two divided-target patient examples. Dose-volume histograms and a normal-tissue complication probability model are used in this analysis. For the patients considered in this study, the normal-tissue-complication probability model predicts that random patient motion less than or equal to 0.2 cm is tolerable in terms of spinal cord complications

PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 57 patients with a median age of 55 years. Management included plaque radiotherapy (14), proton beam radiotherapy (17), local resection (10), endoresection (6), and enucleation (10). Fifty-two tumours involved the choroid. The tumours had a mean diameter of 11.4 mm and a mean thickness of 5.2 mm. RESULTS: The follow-up period had a median of 267 days. Retention of the eye was achieved in all 47 cases who underwent conservative management. Ninety percent of patients retained a vision of counting fingers, with an acuity of 6/12 or better in 50%. CONCLUSION: This group of patients gives an indication of the results that can be expected when uveal melanoma is managed by a variety of conservative techniques in a specialised ocular oncology service
