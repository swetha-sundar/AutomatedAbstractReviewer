The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons

The length of follow-up ranged from 1-115 months (median 42 months). The 5-year actuarial treatment results were: local control rate, 96.8%, determinate survival rate, 81%, freedom from distant metastases, 76%, eye retention rate, 83%, and risk of developing neovascular glaucoma, 36%. Long-term vision outcome was analyzed in 81 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Forty-seven percent of patients retained vision of 20/200 or better. The median change in vision was a loss of four lines on the standard eye chart. Thirty-eight percent of patients had visual acuity either improve or remain within two lines of their pretreatment vision. A multivariate analysis identified tumor size as the only independently significant risk factor affecting survival, development of neovascular glaucoma, or the risk of enucleation; no risk factor correlated with local recurrence. Tumor size, tumor-fovea distance, and pretreatment visual acuity were independently significant risk factors influencing vision outcome. These results confirm that helium ion irradiation is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma which combines high rates of local control, survival, and eye retention with a substantial likelihood of long-term vision preservation

1	1331	Tumor location, cirrhosis, and surgical history contribute to tumor movement in the liver, as measured during stereotactic irradiation using a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system	Computer Systems, Fluoroscopy, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Hepatectomy, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Liver Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) intrafractional motion of liver tumors during real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 20 patients with liver tumors were analyzed. Before treatment, a 2-mm gold marker was implanted near the tumor. The RTRT system used fluoroscopy image processor units to determine the 3D position of the implanted marker. A linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker was located within a permitted region. The automatically recorded tumor-motion data were analyzed to determine the amplitude of the tumor motion, curve shape of the tumor motion, treatment efficiency, frequency of movement, and hysteresis. Each of the following clinical factors was evaluated to determine its contribution to the amplitude of movement: tumor position, existence of cirrhosis, surgical history, tumor volume, and distance between the isocenter and the marker. RESULTS: The average amplitude of tumor motion in the 20 patients was 4 +/- 4 mm (range 1-12), 9 +/- 5 mm (range 2-19), and 5 +/- 3 mm (range 2-12) in the left-right, craniocaudal, and anterior-posterior (AP) direction, respectively. The tumor motion of the right lobe was significantly larger than that of the left lobe in the left-right and AP directions (p = 0.01). The tumor motion of the patients with liver cirrhosis was significantly larger than that of the patients without liver cirrhosis in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.004). The tumor motion of the patients who had received partial hepatectomy was significantly smaller than that of the patients who had no history of any operation on the liver in the left-right and AP directions (p < 0.03). Thus, three of the five clinical factors examined (i.e., tumor position in the liver, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver) significantly affected the tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction during stereotactic irradiation. Frequency analysis revealed that for 9 (45%) of the 20 tumors, the cardiac beat caused measurable motion. The 3D trajectory of the tumor showed hysteresis for 4 (20%) of the 20 tumors. The average treatment efficiency of RTRT was 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location, cirrhosis, and history of surgery on the liver all had an impact on the intrafractional tumor motion of the liver in the transaxial direction. This finding should be helpful in determining the smallest possible margin in individual cases of radiotherapy for liver malignancy	
0	673	Differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence after gamma knife radiosurgery for brain metastases: importance of multi-voxel proton MRS	Abnormalities,Radiation-Induced/di [Diagnosis], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/sc [Secondary], Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research	Comparative analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET, single-voxel, and multi-voxel proton MRS for differentiation between radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence was done in 9 patients with brain metastases treated by gamma knife radiosurgery. In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In June 1999, the Society ordered an analysis of the state of radiation oncology. It created a survey that was sent to all radiotherapy units in Spain. A database was created in which 230 variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-four centers were analyzed, and 157 external beam irradiation, megavoltage units were counted, of which 67 were cobalt units and 90 were linear accelerators. The cobalt units worked an average of 11.4 h daily and the linear accelerators 11.6 h. The number of patients/unit/y was 472 for the cobalt units and 442 for the linear accelerators. The number of patients by physician and year was 179. Each center received a mean of 958 new patients annually. The average between the reception and start of treatment was 25.52 days (maximum 60), and it was estimated that only 38.1% of cancers were irradiated. The number of radiation oncologists working was 392. Spain has a deficit of 297 radiation oncologists. CONCLUSION: There is a need for 44 MV units and for the replacement of 67 cobalt units. The present lack of units has had an impact on palliative treatment, which has resulted in pharmacy costs. As long as these instrumental deficiencies are not solved, waiting lists will continue to be inherent to the system. There are also important staff deficiencies, in that about 297 radiation oncologists would be needed to cover the needs	
1	1964	A system for three-dimensional dosimetric verification of treatment plans in intensity-modulated radiotherapy with heavy ions	Arm, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Computer Simulation, Germany, Heavy Ions, Humans, Ions, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Reproducibility of Results, Water	The introduction of dynamic intensity modulation into radiotherapy using conventional photon beams or scanning particle beams requires additional and efficient methods of dose verification. Dose measurements in dynamically generated dose distributions with a single ionization chamber require a complete application of the treatment field for each single measurement. Therefore measurements are performed by simultaneous use of multiple ionization chambers. The measurement is performed by a computer controlled system and is comprised of the following steps: (a) automated positioning of the ionization chambers, (b) measurement at these points, (c) a comparison with the calculated dose from the treatment planning system, and (d) documentation of the measurement. The ionization chambers are read out by a multichannel electrometer and are densely packed into a mounting of polymethylmetacrylate, which is attached to the arm of a three-dimensional motor-driven water phantom. The measured and planned dose values are displayed numerically as well as graphically. The mean deviation between measured and planned doses as well as their standard deviation are calculated and displayed. Through printouts complete documentation of the measurement is obtained and a quick decision can be made whether the dose distribution is acceptable for the patient. The system is now routinely used for dose verification at the heavy ion therapy project at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. Up to now 242 measurements have been performed for heavy ion treatment of 30 patients. The system allows efficient verification and documentation of carbon ion fields and is in principle also applicable to intensity-modulated photon beams

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1989 through July 2000, 225 patients with HCC underwent their first course of proton beam therapy at the University of Tsukuba. Of them, 27 with 68 lesions who had undergone two or more courses were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Median interval between the first and second course was 24.5 months (range 3.3-79.8 months). Median total dose of 72 Gy in 16 fractions and 66 Gy in 16 fractions were given for the first course and the rest of the courses, respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate and median survival period from the beginning of the first course for the 27 patients were 55.6% and 62.2 months, respectively. Five-year local control rate for the 68 lesions was 87.8%. Of the patients, 1 with Child-Pugh class B and another with class C before the last course suffered from acute hepatic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated proton beam therapy for HCC is safe when the patient has a target in the peripheral region of the liver and liver function is Child-Pugh class A

These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone

In this high risk group of patients, total body irradiation (TBI) has been proposed as a systemic adjuvant. To aid in the design of a clinical TBI protocol, we have studied the in vitro radiation response of two established cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma and human bone marrow CFUc. The Ewing's lines showed a larger Do (1.26 Gy, 2.04 Gy) and n (6.0, 3.2) compared to the bone marrow CFUc (Do = 0.86 Gy, n = 1.2). No repair of potentially lethal radiation damage (PLDR) was found after 4.5 Gy in plateau phase Ewing's sarcoma cells. A theoretical split dose survival curve for both the Ewing's sarcoma lines and human bone marrow CFUc using this TBI schedule shows a significantly lower surviving fraction (10(-4)-10(-5] for the bone marrow CFUc. Based on these in vitro results, two 4.0 Gy fractions separated by 24 hours is proposed as the TBI regimen. Because of the potentially irreversible damage to bone marrow, autologous bone marrow transplantation following the TBI is felt to be necessary. The details of this clinical protocol in high risk Ewing's sarcoma patients are outlined

We have studied the severe complications occurring after treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. Four groups of patients were compared: Group 1 (80 patients) had treatment with surgery alone for mobile and resectable tumors; Group 2 (23 patients) had treatment with high dose preoperative irradiation followed by surgical resection for tumors which were fixed to adjacent structures and initially unresectable for cure; Group 3 (24 patients, primary disease) and Group 4 (17 patients, locally recurrent disease) had locally advanced tumors as in Group 2 but were treated with IORT after preoperative irradiation and attempted surgical resection. All but 3 complications occurred within one year of therapy. Severe complications were seen in 16% of patients in Group 1, 35% in Group 2, 21% in Group 3 and 47% in Group 4 (32% in Groups 3 and 4 combined). There was a statistically insignificant increase (p = .10) in the complication rate in all irradiated patients (locally advanced tumors) compared to surgery alone (clinically mobile tumors). These data indicate no increase in severe complications with the use of IORT. If the ongoing studies continue to show improved local control with the use of IORT, expanded use of this modality may be warranted

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer

Diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases and review of the literature	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Bone, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects

One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now

It was shown that especially chronic side effects are benign in most of all cases. Severe - but not vitally dangerous - complications in bladder and intestine are rare (3%); their percentage corresponds roughly to the average mortality rate of surgical intervention (radical prostatectomy). Contrary to operation, troubles of the sexual function appear only in one third of the patients. Taking into consideration the similar therapeutic results of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, radiotherapy is more favorable with respect to side effects. This essential aspect should be considered when making a decision whether to apply a surgical or a radiotherapeutic treatment treatment

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications	
1	3242	[Clinical investigation of indications in proton therapy]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities, Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The indications for curative treatment with proton therapy were investigated by the clinical results of 31 cancer patients treated with proton beams between 1983 and 1985 at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center of Tsukuba University. Many locally extended, radioresistant lesions, lesions with large volume and small radiocurable lesions in this series revealed sufficient improvement without definite late damage in the surrounding normal tissues. This clinical result suggests that proton beam treatment could be applied to lesions in a much wider range for curative purposes as compared with conventional radiotherapy. This study is to be continued further

The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma

Choroidal biopsy confirmed that the clinical diagnosis and conventional radiotherapy to one eye resulted in rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, cataract, and vitreous hemorrhage. We were able to destroy the tumors in the other eye by photocoagulation and proton beam irradiation without any adverse effects. The patient is in good health 1 1/2 years after therapy and he has 6/6 (20/20) vision in the eye that was treated

The patient maintained good vision until 18 months after therapy, when she developed neovascular glaucoma. This complication required multiple therapeutic procedures, including topical anti-inflammatory and antiglaucomatous drops, 360 degrees peripheral panretinal cryoblation, and a single 180 degrees application of inferior cyclocryotherapy over a 2 1/2-year period. Four weeks after the cyclocryotherapy, inflammation was noted in both eyes, and, one month later, enucleation of the left sympathogenic eye was performed. Serial histopathologic sections showed a full-thickness, fibrovascular, scleral scar and tantalum marker ring suture without uveal incarceration. Penetrating surgical trauma, a uveal melanoma, and multiple nonpenetrating treatments resulted in the development of sympathetic ophthalmia

Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

Besides the physical selectivity that makes ions especially efficient for deep-seated tumours and tumours close to critical organs, carbon ions with their enhanced relative biological effectiveness offer an additional biological advantage for slow-growing radioresistant tumours, with an additional gain for tumours with hypoxic sections. These advantages can only be fully exploited by active beam-shaping and biology-based treatment planning

The median follow-up was 5.4 years, and no patient was lost to follow-up. All tumors showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 35% and 20/100 or better in 58%. Eight eyes were enucleated because of complications. Metastasis developed in 26 patients (20.5%) from 3 months to 7 years after treatment. Results indicate that proton irradiation is quite successful for achieving local control of uveal melanomas. A large proportion of the treated eyes maintained useful vision. Five-year follow-up data indicate that proton irradiation has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastasis

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (pts) were selected to receive an aggressive TURB followed by 2 MCV cycles, and HFRT with concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (33 pts) or HFRT and concomitant CDDP and 5-FU PVI (20 pts). The 5-FU and CDDP doses ranged from 180 to 220 mg/sm/day and from 4 to 6 mg/sm/day, respectively. Radiotherapy was delivered as three 100 cGy fraction per day or two 150 cGy fraction per day to a total dose of 50 Gy to the pelvis and a 20 Gy boost to the bladder. RESULTS: Grade III toxicity in pts who received or not MCV was: rectal tenesmus 12/33 and 0/20, dysuria 6/33 and 4/20, leukopenia 3/33 and 0/20, thrombocytopenia 7/33 and 1/20 pts, respectively. A Grade IV toxicity was observed in 2 pts. Of the 28 evaluable patients treated with MCV, CR were observed in 23 (82%) and PR in 5 cases. Of the 18 evaluable patients treated without MCV, CR were observed in 18 cases (100%). Actually, 65% and 14% of the CR pts treated with or without HCV are alive and free of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This bladder-sparing treatment shows an acceptable acute and late toxicity, similar to that observed with radiotherapy alone. The high CRs and bladder preservation rates observed deserve further clinical evaluation

We evaluated whether L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake and its change after CIRT were the early survival predictors in patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MET positron emission tomography was prospectively performed in 62 patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas before and within 1 month after CIRT. Tumor MET uptake was measured with the semiquantitative tumor:nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). The MET uptake in the tumor and relevant clinical parameters were entered into univariate and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 20 months. Patients with a baseline T/N ratio of <or=6 had a significant better survival than patients with a baseline T/N ratio >6 (2-year survival rate: 69.4% versus 32.3%; P = 0.01). Patients with a post-CIRT ratio of <or=4.4 had a better survival than that with a post-CIRT ratio >4.4 (2-year survival rate: 63.7% versus 41.3%; P = 0.01). A significant higher survival rate was observed in patients with post-therapeutic MET uptake change of >30% than patients in lower change group (2-year survival rate: 74.6% versus 41.6%; P = 0.049). The multivariate analysis showed that both baseline and post-CIRT T/N ratio were statistically significant independent predictors of patient survival. Tumors with larger T/N ratio had a significantly poorer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: MET uptake as measured by either baseline or post-CIRT T/N ratio was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherapy, whereas post-therapeutic MET uptake change might have potential value for the same purpose

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

Local tumor control was achieved in 27 out of 28 patients irradiated immediately after surgery (96%). In case of demonstrated lymph node invasion, local control was achieved in 14 out of 19 cases (74%). The median survival was 9.6 years for patients in stage T1/2, N0, M0 and 2.5 years for patients in stage T1-4, N+, M0. The first two years following to therapy were decisive for the prognosis. Among those of our patients who developed recurrences during this period, not one could be cured in the long run. Two years after the end of therapy, the survival probability of patients without lymph node metastases becomes comparable to the survival curve of normal male population of the same age. In the treatment of penile carcinoma, a gradual proceeding depending on the stage is recommended for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. In case of lymph node metastases, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy should be taken into consideration

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Proton-beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn-Meitner Institute after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

Over 500 patients have now been treated. We have had very good results to date in treating patients with small tumors critically located near a radiation-sensitive organ which would preclude delivering a curative dose with conventional radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients with larger tumors where the tumor dose cannot be increased more than 10% over conventional radiotherapy have not responded well to helium ion radiotherapy. This is illustrated by discussing selected patient groups in detail, namely those with uveal melanoma, small, low-grade tumors near the central nervous system, carcinoma of the pancreas, and carcinoma of the esophagus	
0	1029	Quantification of volumetric and geometric changes occurring during fractionated radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer using an integrated CT/linear accelerator system	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/dt [Drug Therapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Head and Neck Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Middle Aged, Parotid Gland/pa [Pathology], Parotid Gland/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Pilot Projects, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Texas, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Weight Loss	PURPOSE: Many patients receiving fractionated radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer have marked anatomic changes during their course of treatment, including shrinking of the primary tumor or nodal masses, resolving postoperative changes/edema, and changes in overall body habitus/weight loss. We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT

Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity

Since January 1991 we treated 3 retinoblastomas with proton beam at the cyclotron of Louvain-la-Neuve. Results are encouraging. The short term outcome seems comparable to phototherapy, but the long term expectancy is better, because of reduced secondary malignancies. Proton beam treatment for selected retinoblastomas seems a good alternative to external radiotherapy

The main purpose was to determine clinically useful fraction doses without severe acute reaction of normal tissues and to assess tumor control dose levels achievable without significant normal tissue toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment was given with four fixed fractions per week (24 fractions over 6 weeks) and was initiated with a fraction dose of 2.2 Gray equivalent (GyE), and the dose was increased as 2.4 GyE, 2.6 GyE, 2.8 GyE, and 3.0 GyE. Consequently, the total dose initiated was 52.8 GyE, to increase up to 72.0 GyE in 4.8-GyE increments in the dose-escalation fashion. Thirty patients with eligible advanced cervical cancers consisting of 27 squamous cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas were analyzed. RESULTS: Acute response of normal tissues was less than with photon treatment until fraction doses of 2.8 GyE were administered, and patients finished treatment with comfortable conditions. Severe late complications occurred in the two patients who received more than 67.2 GyE. The 2-year cumulative survival rate and the local control rate of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were 61.5% and 59.3%, respectively. According to stages, the 2-year survival rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 54.4% and 75.0%, respectively. The 2-year local control rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 52.6% and 75.0%, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results indicated that the disease control seems to be relatively better for very advanced disease and with dose escalation treatment. Local control was not significantly correlated with total dose and tumor volume. The results of the present study, despite small numbers and short observation, suggest that an adequate fraction dose for pelvis fields is 2.8 to 3.0 GyE and that the carbon beam therapy might be advantageous for advanced cervical cancer

CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 55 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated between 2001 and 2005 with C-ion RT based on computed tomography treatment planning. All patients had a tumor of large size or one located close to the optic disk. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of NVG for the following parameters; gender, age, dose-volumes of the iris-ciliary body and the wall of eyeball, and irradiation of the optic disk (ODI). RESULTS: Neovascular glaucoma occurred in 23 patients and the 3-year cumulative NVG rate was 42.6 +/- 6.8% (standard error), but enucleation from NVG was performed in only three eyes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant risk factors for NVG were V50IC (volume irradiated > or =50 GyE to iris-ciliary body) (p = 0.002) and ODI (p = 0.036). The 3-year NVG rate for patients with V50IC > or =0.127 mL and those with V50IC <0.127 mL were 71.4 +/- 8.5% and 11.5 +/- 6.3%, respectively. The corresponding rate for the patients with and without ODI were 62.9 +/- 10.4% and 28.4 +/- 8.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dose-volume histogram analysis with computed tomography indicated that V50IC and ODI were independent risk factors for NVG. An irradiation system that can reduce the dose to both the anterior segment and the optic disk might be worth adopting to investigate whether or not incidence of NVG can be decreased with it

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

In this high risk group of patients, total body irradiation (TBI) has been proposed as a systemic adjuvant. To aid in the design of a clinical TBI protocol, we have studied the in vitro radiation response of two established cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma and human bone marrow CFUc. The Ewing's lines showed a larger Do (1.26 Gy, 2.04 Gy) and n (6.0, 3.2) compared to the bone marrow CFUc (Do = 0.86 Gy, n = 1.2). No repair of potentially lethal radiation damage (PLDR) was found after 4.5 Gy in plateau phase Ewing's sarcoma cells. A theoretical split dose survival curve for both the Ewing's sarcoma lines and human bone marrow CFUc using this TBI schedule shows a significantly lower surviving fraction (10(-4)-10(-5] for the bone marrow CFUc. Based on these in vitro results, two 4.0 Gy fractions separated by 24 hours is proposed as the TBI regimen. Because of the potentially irreversible damage to bone marrow, autologous bone marrow transplantation following the TBI is felt to be necessary. The details of this clinical protocol in high risk Ewing's sarcoma patients are outlined

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

The tumors of all patients were histologically confirmed. A 45 MV betatron was used for radiation of the clipped tumor volume plus a 1 to 2 cm margin. Fourteen patients were treated by a three-field technic with the use of opposed lateral photon beams and an anterior mixed photon-electron beam. Five patients were treated with either a four-field "box" or a three-field photon technic. Tumor doses of 5,900 to 6,700 r were delivered over seven to nine weeks. The twelve month survival rate after diagnosis is 53%. This compares favorably with published reports of patients treated surgically for cure. Four patients are alive 18.5 to 64 months after diagnosis. Three are clinically free of disease. Treatment has been well tolerated and there have been no significant radiation complications

The patient retained 6/7.5 visual acuity for 2 1/2 years before he was killed in an automobile accident. The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision

[Spanish]	Adolescent, Child, Child,Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Intraoperative Care, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Risk	Conventional external beam radiation has proved its profit in pediatric tumors; but its complications have limited it in therapeutical approach. Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

The only effective treatment is laser photocoagulation, which is associated with decreased visual acuity following treatment in most patients. This study assessed both the response of subfoveal CNV to proton beam irradiation and treatment-related morbidity. We evaluated preliminary results in patients treated with an initial dose of 8 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) using a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with subfoveal CNV received proton irradiation to the central macula with a single fraction of 8 CGE; 19 were eligible for evaluation. Treatment-related morbidity was based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria; response was evaluated by Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) guidelines. Fluorescein angiography was performed; visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and reading speed were measured at study entry and at 3-month intervals after treatment. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 15 months. RESULTS: No measurable treatment-related morbidity was seen during or after treatment. Of 19 patients evaluated at 6 months, fluorescein angiography demonstrated treatment response in 10 (53%); 14 (74%) patients had improved or stable visual acuity. With a mean follow-up of 11.6 months, 11 (58%) patients have demonstrated improved or stable visual acuity. CONCLUSION: A macular dose of 8 CGE yielded no measurable treatment morbidity in patients studied. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated that regressed or stabilized lesions were associated with improved visual acuity as compared with MPS results. In the next phase, a dose of 14 CGE in a single fraction will be used to further define the optimal dose fractionation schedule

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

Despite surgical exploration and an extensive diagnostic workup including radiological, nuclear medicine, and computer-assisted tomographic studies, many patients proved to have occult liver metastases manifested within 9 months post treatment. In addition, local and regional control of the primary neoplasm (approximately 20%) has been difficult to obtain even with doses of 6000 equivalent rad in 7 1/2 weeks. Gastric and biliary obstruction have required surgical bypass procedures since irradiation has not been successful in relieving obstructive symptoms. Evidence of gastrointestinal injury has been present in postradiation therapy in approximately 10% of patients, a figure which might be higher if more patients had a longer survival (average 10 months). Some patients require pancreatic enzyme supplementation because of pancreatic deficiency either secondary to tumor or treatment. Further improvement in local control and survival requires better diagnostic methods for evaluation of local and metastatic spread, improved therapy for local and regional disease, as well as therapy directed at occult liver metastases that are frequently present

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications

We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding	
0	1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses

Mode of action and problems are discussed and published results reported. Human tumour cells obtained of biopsies from our patients before the onset of treatments were investigated. The short time cell cultures were treated either with hyperthermia or irradiation alone or with combinations under the same conditions as the clinical treatments. We could clearly demonstrate that cell cultures of human origin respond to irradiation or hyperthermia. But the effect was limited and only cultures treated with combined modalities did not relapse. There is hope that mega-voltage radiation complemented with hyperthermia have a similar effect as high-LET-radiation. Side effects have been moderate so far using an extended clinical use	
1	3599	Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors: spinal theca irradiation	Bone Marrow, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Growth/re [Radiation Effects], Heart, Humans, Liver, Lung, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Neuroectodermal Tumors,Primitive/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Spine/re [Radiation Effects], Survival, Switzerland, Thyroid Gland, Universities, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conventional postoperative photon-beam radiotherapy to the spine in children with medulloblastoma/PNET is associated with severe late effects. This morbidity (growth and developmental) is related to the exit dose of the beams and is particularly severe in young children. With the purpose of reducing this toxicity, a dosimetric study was undertaken in which proton therapy was compared to standard megavoltage photon treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The results of a comparative dosimetric study are presented in such a way that the dose distribution achievable with a posterior modulated 100 MeV proton beam (spot scanning method) is compared with that of a standard set of posterior 6 MV x-ray fields. The potential improvements with protons are evaluated, using dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the target as well as the dose to the vertebral bodies (growth plates), lungs, heart, and liver. RESULTS: The target (i.e., the spinal dural sac) received the full prescribed dose in both treatment plans. However, the proportions of the vertebral body volume receiving > or = 50% of the prescribed dose were 100 and 20% for 6 MV x-rays and protons, respectively. For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET. The potential bone marrow and growth arrest sparing effects make this approach specially attractive for intensive chemotherapy protocols and for very young children. Sparing the thyroid gland, the posterior heart wall, and the gonads may be additional advantages in assuring a long-term posttreatment morbidity-free survival

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and February 1997, 24 patients with histopathologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were treated to 15 fractions within 5 weeks in a step-wise dose-escalation study. The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78% and 75% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92% and 92%, 81% and 50%, and 81% and 25% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy appears safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional clinical studies using a larger subject group are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect

The authors' findings evidence that postradiation changes in the anterior segment of the eye, resulting from radiation iridocyclitis, are mainly responsible for the development of secondary glaucoma. Preliminary laser-effected formation of iridal coloboma is conducive to a normal flow in the anterior chamber at the expense of an additional pupil functioning and thus helps reduce the possibility of secondary glaucoma development by 1.6 times (or by 38.5%)

[Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Biological Markers, Biological Markers/an [Analysis], Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choline/an [Analysis], Female, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/me [Metabolism], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Lipids, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Time, Treatment Outcome	The evaluation of the response to radiation therapy in brain tumor patients is a major and an important issue. Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages

These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases

Hypophyseal tumors, tumors of the cavernous sinus, arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area, and arteriovenous malformations are irradiated at the N. N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR, AMS using the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Methods of "piercing" irradiation and methods with the use of Bragg's peak are being developed. At present over 200 patients with hormonally active hypophyseal tumors, 30 patients with tumors of the cavernous sinus, 23 patients with deep seated arteriovenous malformations, and 10 patients with spontaneous arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area have been irradiated. This method seems to hold promise in neurosurgical practice. Extension of the range of clinical applications of proton beam therapy in neurosurgery requires the development of various techniques of irradiation, all possible approaches to various targets on the basis of contemporary methods of computerized diagnosis, topometry and irradiation design

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

The period of 50% decrease in tumor size in response to radiation treatment was established in 116 patients with cervical carcinoma by means of a dynamical cytological examination. Acceleration of tumor regression was followed by an increase in 5-year survival rates. A reverse correlation was established between growth and regression rates of cervical carcinoma. Thanks to the determination of tumor regression rates, various modalities of radiation treatment could be evaluated in the course of therapy and their efficacy predicted

Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

Longterm follow-up after conventional high voltage radiation in 17 patients and proton therapy in 13 patients confirmed a similar reduction of GH levels in both groups. After 4.5 years a decrease of about 80% was achieved. After "conventional radiation" GH was normal in 8 (47%) and near normal in 6 (35%) while proton therapy resulted in normalization in 5 and improvement in 5 (38%). The slightly better results of "conventional radiation" must be attributed to lower pretreatment levels of GH. Side effects as additional pituitary deficits and oculomotor palsies were more often seen after proton treatment. Since the results of both radiation methods are similar and proton therapy has a tendency to more serious side effects we recommend "conventional radiation" as secondary treatment of acromegaly

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

Proton beam irradiation has recently been used for selected lesions. The advantage of this method is that the dose can be localized to the tumor more accurately. Other therapies include chemotherapy, photocoagulation, or, in extreme cases, enucleation. The author discusses these treatment modalities, complications, and prospects for future therapies.

METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas and 8 had diffuse choroidal hemangiomas (DCH) and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Of the patients, 19 were treated with photons with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy. A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All patients with DCH but 1 were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of all patients. Tumor thickness decreased in 95.4% and retinal detachment resolved in 92.9%. Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected. In all, 40.9% showed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, maximum Grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity. Retinopathy and radiation-induced optic neuropathy were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely. No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected. Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects should be part of the follow-up procedures

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons

All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma

This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable	
0	4624	Proton or stereotactic photon irradiation for posterior uveal melanoma? A planning intercomparison	Berlin, Eye Injuries/et [Etiology], Eye Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Fovea Centralis, Germany, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Methods, Optic Disk, Optic Nerve, Patients, Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Safety, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton and stereotactic radiotherapy with photons (SRT) are both used to treat choroidal melanomas in proximity to optic disk and fovea centralis, a situation where plaque therapy is prone to complications. A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated	
0	1317	Optimization of radiation therapy for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas with infiltration of the skull base using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a carbon ion boost	Carbon, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Ethmoid Sinus, Germany, Humans, Ions, Jaw Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lead, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

This represents the largest group evaluated histologically in the literature and is the first report evaluating effects of particle radiation in pancreatic tissue. Patient survival after therapy averaged 9 months. Most died of infection and/or pulmonary emboli. Local control was achieved in 27%. The pancreatic tumors had histologically more severe radiation changes than nontumor bearing pancreas. Irradiated bone marrow was severely hypocellular, and irradiated skin was atrophic. Five patients had radiation injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal cord, liver, and kidneys showed no damage. This study demonstrates the safety of helium particle irradiation with present therapeutic planning. Injury to tumor was seen without excessive damage to adjacent tissues

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma	
1	721	Therapy strategies for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas using modern radiation therapy techniques	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Germany, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Orbital Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated whether modern photon techniques, such as stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy (FSRT) or intensity-modulated RT, outweighed the biologic advantages of high-linear-energy transfer RT in the treatment of patients with locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) that infiltrated the skull base or the orbit. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5% and 77.5% for Group A and 72.2% and 24.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5%/53% and 86.6%/75.8% for Group A and 69.2%/23% and 77.9%/77.9% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone	
0	3798	Evaluation of a pencil-beam dose calculation technique for charged particle radiotherapy	Algorithms, California, Californium, Chordoma, Chordoma/ra [Radiography], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Scattering,Radiation, Skull Base, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate a pencil-beam dose calculation algorithm for protons and heavier charged particles in complex patient geometries defined by computed tomography (CT) data and to compare isodose distributions calculated with the new technique to those calculated with conventional algorithms in selected patients with skull-base tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Monte Carlo calculations were performed to evaluate the pencil-beam algorithm in patient geometries for a modulated 150-MeV proton beam. A modified version of a Monte Carlo code described in a previous publication (18) was used for these comparisons. Tissue densities were inferred from patient CT data on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and calculations were performed with and without tissue compensators. A dose calculation module using the new algorithm was written, and treatment plans using the new algorithm were compared to plans using standard ray-tracing techniques for 10 patients with clival chordoma and three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with helium lons at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL). RESULTS: Pencil beam calculations agreed well with Monte Carlo calculations in the patient geometries. The pencil-beam algorithm predicted several multiple-scattering effects that are not modeled by conventional ray-tracing calculations. These include (a) the widening of the penumbra as a function of beam penetration, (b) the degradation in the sharpness of the dose gradient at the end of the particle range in highly heterogeneous regions, and (c) the appearance of hot and cold dose regions in the shadow of complex heterogeneities. In particular, pencil-beam calculations indicated that the dose distribution within the target was not as homogeneous as expected on the basis of ray-tracing calculations. On average, for the 13 patients considered, only about 72% of the conedown target volume received at least 99% of the prescribed dose, whereas, 93% of the conedown volume was contained within the 95% isodose surface. This may be significant because in standard charged particle dose calculations, the dose across the spread-Bragg peak is assumed to be uniform and equal to the maximum or prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Dose distributions computed with the pencil-beam model are more accurate than ray-tracing calculations, providing additional information to clinicians, which may influence the doses they prescribe. In particular, these calculations indicate that for some patients with skull-base tumors, it may be advantageous to prescribe proton doses to a lower isodose level than is commonly done	
1	1753	Quality of life, health outcomes, and identity for patients with prostate cancer in five different treatment groups	Aged, Gender Identity, Health Status, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Oncologic Nursing, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/nu [Nursing], Prostatic Neoplasms/px [Psychology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Quality of Life, Questionnaires, Radiation, Research, Treatment Outcome, United States, Universities	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe how different treatments for prostate cancer affect health-related quality of life (QOL), health status, and masculinity. DESIGN: Longitudinal survey design with descriptive, correlational, and comparative elements. SETTING: A tertiary medical center and associated clinics in a suburban community in the Southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 185 men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled from five treatment groups: watchful waiting (n = 30), surgery (n = 59), conventional radiation (n = 25), proton-beam radiation (n = 24), and a combination of conventional radiation and proton-beam radiation or mixed-beam radiation (n = 47). At six months, 163 remained on the study; at 12 months, 154 remained: and at 18 months, 153 remained. The average age was 68 years, and 82% of the men were white. METHODS: Men were enrolled at treatment and given a questionnaire with a self-addressed, stamped envelope for return. Questionnaires were mailed again at 6, 12, and 18 months. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Health-related QOL health status, prostate treatment-specific symptoms, and sex-role identity. FINDINGS: No overall difference in health-related QOL or health status was found, but post-hoc analysis revealed specific differences. The differences existed in sexual functioning and gastrointestinal treatment-specific symptoms. No relationship existed between masculinity and health-related QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related QOL and health status are similar regardless of type of treatment. Radiation tends to produce more gastrointestinal symptoms, and surgery tends to produce more sexual functioning symptoms. Watchful waiting is associated with poorer general health. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses can provide specific treatment-related information to men who are faced with making treatment decisions for prostate cancer and, in consultation with the healthcare team, can select a treatment best sulted to them	
1	2170	Stereotactic proton beam therapy of skull base meningiomas	Adult, Aged, Cobalt, Cranial Nerve Diseases/et [Etiology], Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Skull Base, South Africa, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To review outcomes for patients with skull base meningiomas treated using the stereotactic proton beam at the National Accelerator Center (NAC), Republic of South Africa. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions. RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an alpha/beta value of 3.7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated. CONCLUSION: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

Treatment planning techniques involving therapeutic beam characteristics are described here. The vertical (140 MeV/u) and horizontal (170 MeV/u) carbon ion beams from the synchrotron at the NIRS were shaped, using the passive beam delivery system, to irradiate the target volume. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with a region of uniform HMV-I cell killing. The apertures and range compensators were designed for individual patients. A commercial treatment planning system, which was customized to our general carbon ion therapy, was tested for applicability to this treatment. Dose distributions were calculated with either a broad beam or a pencil beam algorithm using parameters determined by measurements and calculations. We evaluated the accuracy of the system software features, and replaced or added some other features to the software. The system was used for 12 patients during the past year. For nine patients two-port treatment was assessed to be more effective than mono-port therapy and these patients were treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams

A high alpha 1-antitrypsin level and a normal alpha 2-macroglobulin level were found in all the breast cancer patients. An increase in both blood serum inhibitors was detected in hypophyseal adenoma. The dependence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin content on a subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spread was revealed in the course of 2 years following "hypophysectomy" in the patients with disseminated breast cancer. In the hypophyseal adenoma patients the activity of both inhibitors returned to normal 1 year after treatment and remained within normal during 3 years of follow-up. It was regarded as a positive therapeutic effect. The above findings make it possible to propose the determination of the activity af alpha 1-antitrypsin in breast cancer and alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in hypophyseal adenoma as an additional test for the evaluation of the results of proton "hypophysectomy"	
0	1186	Comparison of a micro-multileaf collimator with a 5-mm-leaf-width collimator for intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Software, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	PURPOSE: To dosimetrically compare a micro-multileaf collimator (minimum leaf width of 3 mm) with the 5-mm-leaf multileaf collimator (MLC) of a standard linear accelerator for stereotactic conformal radiotherapy treatment of intracranial lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service

In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 125 patients who underwent proton therapy between July 2003 and December 2004. Of these 125 patients, 11 had head and neck malignancies, 15 non-small cell lung cancers, 22 hepatocellular carcinomas, 62 prostate cancers, and 15 other malignant tumors. RESULTS: Most patients experienced Grade 0-1 acute morbidities (NCI-CTC) in skin or mucosa, while a temporary Grade 2-3 reaction was observed in a high dose area. Response rates were 73% for H & N malignancies, 100% for NSCLC, and 77% for HCC. PSA evaluation for patients with prostate cancer revealed a high rate of complete response. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of proton therapy at Shizuoka Cancer Center was demonstrated for patients with early-stage cancer or locally advanced disease

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

[Review] [68 refs] [Dutch]	Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Databases, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Ions, Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostate, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Retrospective Studies, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the present role of proton and ion therapy, also referred to as 'charged particle therapy', in the treatment of cancer. DESIGN: Systematic literature study. METHOD: Systematic electronic searches were carried out in 12 databases according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, without restriction as to year of publication or study design. Manual searches of bibliographies and journals were also performed. The inclusion criteria were: at least 20 patients and a follow-up of at least 2 years. In addition, experts on the subject were consulted by correspondence for their opinion. RESULTS: The search identified 36 relevant articles on proton therapy and 15 on ion therapy. Based on prospective and retrospective studies, proton irradiation emerged as the treatment of choice for ocular tumours, chordomas and skull-base tumours. For prostate cancer, the results were comparable with the best results of photon therapy. Ion therapy was still in an experimental phase. CONCLUSION: According to the current literature, proton therapy is looked upon as the preferred treatment modality for certain rare tumours, such as ocular tumours, chordoma, and skull-base tumours. However, charged particle therapy as a whole, and especially ion therapy, is not supported as the treatment of choice for cancer by published evidence. Nevertheless, the potential theoretical benefit of this treatment is great. [References: 68]

For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended

Seventy-eight of 82 patients have either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Forty-five of 46 patients followed for at least 1 year after therapy have demonstrated tumor regression with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 31%. No tumor-related mortality has been observed. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged particle external beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

MRI follow-up examination 7 months after radiotherapy showed a gadolinium-DTPA-enhancing mass lesion indicative of high-grade tumor progression. This assumption was also supported by positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET). In contrast, proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) indicated radiation necrosis, which was confirmed histopathologically in surgical specimens. Subsequent follow-up examinations up to 19 months after surgery showed no evidence of tumor recurrence

To understand better these relations, four groups of cases were examined: 1.) 126 choroidal melanomas which were treated conservatively with Cobalt 60 applicator from 1969 till 1984. 2.) 715 choroidal melanomas which have been treated with proton-beam from 1984 to 1989. 3.) 7 tumors or pseudotumors for which for diagnostic purposes a phosphorus 32 test was necessary. 4.) 9 choroid melanomas which had conservative treatment and where vitrectomy was realized. The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment the thickness of the tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in choroid melanoma which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality

In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

Fifteen patients with urinary malignant tumors were treated by proton irradiation during the period from June, 1985 to March, 1989 at Particle Radiation Medical Center, University of Tsukuba. Four patients were with renal cell carcinoma, five with prostatic cancer and six with bladder cancer. Treatment results were assessed by change in tumor size either three or six months after the irradiation. In all the four cases with renal cell carcinoma, the tumor sizes were found to be unchanged without any enlargement. Of the five cases with prostatic cancer, two showed that the treatment was effective and the tumor sizes in the other three cases were found to be unchanged. In three of the six cases with bladder cancer the tumors disappeared while the treatment was found effective in two other and it did not cause any enlargement of the tumor in the remaining one. Although local control of the tumor was successful in all the cases, one patient with prostatic cancer and three with bladder cancer died of cancer. Various side effects, such as radiation cystitis, were observed. This prospective therapy is expected to replace the conventional photon therapy. However, some improvement is needed to make full use of the advantageous properties in dose distribution. Combination therapy with other general therapy is required for some cases	
0	1421	[Comparison with dose-volume histograms of two conformal irradiation techniques used for the treatment of T2N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer, one with association of photons and protons and another with photons alone]. [French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

There is no consensus among neurosurgeons as to the best device (gamma knife, linear accelerator), the treatment doses, and the clinical indications of stereotactic radiosurgery. Therefore, this report is the viewpoint of one neurosurgical team only. In the radiosurgery literature, there is no clear evidence of better results with the gamma-knife or the linear accelerators. With regard to clinical applications, cerebral arteriovenous malformations are the more widely accepted indications of radiosurgery, since a cerebral angiography can confirm the disappearance of the nidus of an arteriovenous malformation treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Usually, small and deep arteriovenous malformations can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery only. Nevertheless, the treatment of the other arteriovenous malformations more often require procedures including one or several of the following treatment methods: microneurosurgery, interventional neuradiology, stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery in acoustic schwannomas, skull base meningiomas, especially those involving the cavernous sinus, brain metastases, and pituitary tumors seem attractive. Contrary to arteriovenous malformations, the lack of criteria for cure requires a long follow-up and carefully controlled trials to confirm the efficiency of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors. On the other hand, experience of stereotactic radiosurgery for astrocytomas and glioblastomas is limited, and few publications are available. Furthermore, because of the infiltrating growth, a major impact of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors is presumably not to be expected. Lastly, a close multidisciplinary approach seems absolutely necessary to define the best indications of stereotactic radiosurgery and to improve its clinical results

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1066-1070

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system

Thirty-eight had major surgery before or after irradiation. Major complications (fistula formation, carotid artery exposure or blowout requiring ligation, or major wound breakdown) occurred in 37%. The complication rates associated with surgery prior to irradiation, planned surgery following irradiation, and salvage surgery following irradiation were 0/12, 4/5, and 10/21, respectively. The complication rate for surgery following neutron irradiation alone was 73%; for surgery following mixed-beam irradiation it was 20%. The age of the patient and the interval between surgery and irradiation had no influence on the complication rate

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

The distribution was determined for four nuclides: 232Th and its decay products, 228Ra and 228Th; and 230Th, a contaminant associated with Thorotrast. More than 90% of the activity was associated with the reticuloendothelial system. Approximately 32% of the total activity was found in the total skeleton (mineral bone and bone marrow), which is somewhat higher than expected from the literature. The 44% found in the liver and 12% in the spleen were somewhat lower than expected. This difference may be attributable, in part, to the initial deposition as influenced by colloidal particle size and to the radiation-induced hyposplenism, splenic atrophy, and slight hepatic atrophy observed at autopsy. In addition, roughly 3% of the activity was found in the Thorotrastoma and surrounding carotid artery tissue. Estimated lifetime absorbed doses from the 232Th series were 15 Gy to the liver, 121 Gy to the spleen, 4 Gy to the skeleton, and 16 Gy to the Thorotrastoma. Comparable dose equivalents to these tissues are 300, 2420, 80, and 320 Sv, respectively, assuming a quality factor of 20 for alpha irradiation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality	
1	2353	Stereotactic convergent beam radiosurgery versus stereotactic conformation beam radiotherapy	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Equipment Design, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Hearing, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Complications/et [Etiology], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities	By means of preliminary results in the treatment of patients with acoustic neurinoma the achievable accuracies, dose distributions and time consumption of stereotactic LINAC-based convergent beam radiosurgery are compared to those achieved with fractionated stereotactic conformation beam radiotherapy. Characteristics of both techniques are described. With the Tubingen radiosurgery system a good adaptation of the dose distribution to spherical or oval target volumes with a steep dose gradient was achieved, whereas homogeneity and adaptation of the dose distribution to irregularly shaped targets were better with the Heidelberg conformation technique. The mechanical accuracy of the Tubingen floorstand system was 0.3 mm +/- 0.2 mm, and that of the Heidelberg mask fixation system < 1 mm. Both methods require similar total treatment times. Nine patients were treated by the Tubingen radiosurgery system. The results are compared with 12 patients treated by conformation radiotherapy in Heidelberg. In both patient groups no further tumour growth occurred. Four of 9 single dose treated patients developed side-effects, such as temporary trigeminal and facial paraesthesia hearing deterioration and oedema. In contrast, patients treated by fractionated radiotherapy showed no side-effects. Relating to the short follow-up the results indicate that single dose application has certain drawbacks for special indications. Further studies have to work out which method gives the best treatment results

OBJECTIVE: To compare various methods of modeling the relationship between tumor dimension and metastatic death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1204 patients with primary choroidal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between January 1985 and December 1998. Largest basal diameter and largest perpendicular basal diameter were recorded at the time of surgical placement of tantalum rings used for tumor localization during proton treatment. The height of the tumor and the axial diameter of the eye were measured by ultrasonography prior to treatment. Using proportional hazards regression, we compared the prognostic influence of different indices of tumor size with estimated risk ratios and death rates according to tumor basal area and largest basal diameter. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up annually through June 30, 2000. Of the 1204 patients analyzed, 193 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up among survivors was 7.9 years. The 5- and 10-year metastatic death rates were 12.8% and 20.7%, respectively. Among various approaches for modeling tumor dimension, the logarithm of tumor basal area had the highest log-likelihood and performed better than other approaches in 85% of the simulations. Based on this model, the covariate-adjusted rate ratio for any doubling in tumor basal area was 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.28). CONCLUSION: Tumor basal area is a better prognostic indicator than largest tumor diameter and tumor volume in the prediction of metastatic death after proton beam irradiation for uveal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location	
0	136	Comparative treatment planning between proton and x-ray therapy in esophageal cancer	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage x-rays and protons for five patients with esophageal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of x-rays. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma	
0	673	Differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence after gamma knife radiosurgery for brain metastases: importance of multi-voxel proton MRS	Abnormalities,Radiation-Induced/di [Diagnosis], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/sc [Secondary], Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research	Comparative analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET, single-voxel, and multi-voxel proton MRS for differentiation between radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence was done in 9 patients with brain metastases treated by gamma knife radiosurgery. In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer

This is the first trial to investigate the utility of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the imaging of chordoma before and after carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with chordoma were investigated with MET-PET before and after CIRT and the findings analyzed visually and quantitatively. Tumor MET uptake was evaluated by tumor-to-nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). RESULTS: In 12 (80%) patients chordoma was clearly visible in the baseline MET-PET study with a mean T/N ratio of 3.3+/-1.7. The MET uptake decreased significantly to 2.3+/-1.4 after CIRT ( P<0.05). A significant reduction in tumor MET uptake of 24% was observed after CIRT. Fourteen (93%) patients showed no local recurrence after CIRT with a median follow-up time of 20 months. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that MET-PET is feasible for imaging of chordoma. MET-PET could provide important tumor metabolic information for the therapeutic monitoring of chordoma after CIRT

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

This study was to analyze long-term treatment efficacy, and relevant factors influencing prognosis of NPC in children. METHODS: From Jan. 1975 to Dec. 1995, 47 children,7-14 years old, with NPC diagnosed by pathology received radiotherapy in our hospital. Radiation doses were 52-74 Gy/6-13 weeks [(64.68+/-5.68) Gy] in nasopharynx, and 46-73 Gy/5-13 weeks [(57.77+/-5.86) Gy] in neck; 21 received 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluoroucil, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) before radiotherapy. Survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and analyzed by log-rank test with SPSS 10.0 software. RESULTS: The 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 47 patients were 72.3%, 53.2%, and 40.4%, respectively. Clinical stage (P=0.046), mode of biopsy (P=0.024), radiation dose in nasopharynx (P=0.049), and short-term efficacy (P=0.005) correlated with prognosis of these patients. The average height of 15 male children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years was (161.5+/-1.23) cm. Among 3 female children with NPC who survived for more than 5 years, 2 had menstruation disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage, mode of biopsy, radiation dose in nasopharynx, short-term efficacy may influence prognosis of NPC in children. Radiation-induced long-term sequelae of NPC in children should not be overlooked

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

Patients with cervix or esophageal cancer were treated with 10 MV X-rays produced at a LINAC accelerator, or high-energy carbon ions produced at the HIMAC accelerator at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba. Blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the radiation treatment. Chromosomes were prematurely condensed by incubation in calyculin A. Aberrations in chromosomes 2 and 4 were scored after fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole-chromosome probes. Pre-treatment samples were exposed in vitro to X-rays, individual dose-response curves for the induction of chromosomal aberrations were determined, and used as calibration curves to calculate the effective whole-body dose absorbed during the treatment. This calculated dose, based on the calibration curve relative to the induction of reciprocal exchanges, has a sharp increase after the first few fractions of the treatment, then saturates at high doses. Although carbon ions are 2-3 times more effective than X-rays in tumor sterilization, the effective dose was similar to that of X-ray treatment. However, the frequency of complex-type chromosomal exchanges was much higher for patients treated with carbon ions than X-ray

Over 100 patients were treated using this system, which is fitted to a Clinac 600C linac. Both cranial and extracranial lesions have been treated using this modality. Immobilization is achieved either with the Talon system for cranial sites or an Aquaplast cast. Target volumes up to 500 cm3 have been treated. Multiple lesions (up to 3) were treated in one setup. The range of dose/fractionation schemes used was 15 Gy/1 fx (radiosurgical treatment) - 80 Gy/40 fx. Dose validation studies were carried out using film and ion chamber dosimetry in a specially designed phantom. Optimal dose distributions were attainable using inverse treatment planning for IMRT delivery. These were found to encompass the target volumes accurately using dose validation phantom studies. Immobilization methods used were accurate to within 1 mm, as evidenced by daily portal films. IMRT using the Peacock system offers the advantage of delivery of conformal therapy to high doses safely and accurately. This provides the opportunity for dose escalation studies, retreatment of previously treated tumors, as well as treating multiple targets in one setup. The system may be fitted to a conventional linac without major modifications

Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings continue to support radiosurgery as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors that results in low rates of morbidity

Temozolomide has shown antineoplastic activity against malignant gliomas and more recently was beneficial in one patient with gliomatosis cerebri. To make an objective assessment of the effect of long-term temozolomide administration in a patient with gliomatosis cerebri we used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural MRI. A 46-year-old man with gliomatosis cerebri was treated with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 28 days). Twenty cycles of temozolomide resulted in a marked reduction in choline and scyllo-inositol content, as detected using brain proton MR spectroscopy, indicating reduced tumor cellularity and/or growth rate. Neurochemical improvements were associated with normalization of the signal intensity in most of the previously affected cerebral regions and regression of mass effect on MRI. A left pyramidal syndrome, present at the start of the treatment, disappeared. Our observation lends support to larger clinical trials evaluating the use of temozolomide to treat this brain tumor

DESIGN: A retrospective, nonrandomized comparative study. METHODS: Charts of patients treated with 125I, 106Ru, and PBRT for choroidal melanoma between January 1988 and June 1996 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospitals were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Local control of choroidal melanomas after 125I, 106Ru, or PBRT. RESULTS: A total of 597 patients were identified (125I = 190, 106Ru = 140, PBRT = 267). Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did patients treated with either 125I (P = 0.0133; confidence interval [CI], 1.26-7.02; risk ratio, 2.97) or PBRT (P = 0.0097; CI, 1.30-6.66; risk ratio, 2.94). A stepwise Cox proportional hazard model found maximal basal diameter to be a significant covariate (P = 0.0033). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did those patients treated with either 125I or PBRT	
0	507	Prognostic significance of serial magnetic resonance spectroscopies over the course of radiation therapy for patients with malignant glioma	Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease Progression, Female, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Survival Analysis, Survivors	BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of high grade gliomas (HGG) involves maximal neuro-surgical debulking, followed by post-operative radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, depending on histologic grade. Despite this aggressive strategy, there are few long-term survivors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging method that can monitor metabolic changes in brain tumours. To date there is little data concerning the prognostic significance of the evolving spectral alterations during a course of radiotherapy. MATERIALS: We report herein a prospective study of patients with HGGs undergoing post-operative radiotherapy. Fourteen consecutively eligible patients with a confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant glioma and completion of all required MRS imaging were included in this study. All patients had MRS imaging prior to radiotherapy, at week 4 of radiotherapy, and 2 months post-treatment. T1 and T2 weighted images as well as post-gadolinium multi-voxel proton MRS images were obtained. Normalized (tumour metabolite/normal brain metabolite) levels of choline, NAA, creatine, lipid and lactate were calculated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of progression-free and overall survival were constructed based on the evolving patterns of metabolite changes over the course of the images. RESULTS: The mean tumour choline/NAA ratio decreased over the course of therapy, with a reduction observed between the baseline and post-radiotherapy studies (1.91 vs. 1.29, P=0.049). A similar decrease was identified with the mean normalized choline ratio, with a highly significant difference observed between the baseline and post-radiation images (1.61 vs. 0.96, P=0.001). Patients who exhibited more than 40% decrease in normalized choline between the week 4 and post-radiotherapy studies were associated with unfavourable survival (logrank test, P=0.003) and disease progression (logrank test, P=0.012). The Lactate/NAA ratio at the 4th week of radiotherapy and the change in normalized choline/creatine between baseline and week 4 of radiotherapy were also predictive of outcome suggesting the possibility of adaptive, response-based radiation treatment. Patients with two or more poor prognostic MRS indices had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with zero or one poor indices, with 15% and 68% at 1 year, respectively (logrank test, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The evolving pattern of spectral changes over the course of radiotherapy, in particular those associated with choline-containing compounds, appears to be prognostic of tumour response and outcome. Based on our data, a decision point may exist in the mid course of radical radiotherapy, at which time consideration of the choline levels could indicate the extent of radiotherapeutic response, thus allowing for individualized treatment modification

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

In this report, we present three patients with malignant liver tumors treated by proton beam therapy in whom pre- and post-therapeutic hepatic functional reserves were evaluated sequentially for more than a year by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. All three patients exhibited the distinctive time course of 99mTc-GSA uptake efficiency, which suggested a transient decline in the ratio of liver activity to heart and liver activity at 15 minutes (LHL15) 3-6 months after proton beam therapy. This change was not in parallel with that expected from a functioning normal liver tissue volume. In a year after proton beam therapy, LHL15 recovered nearly to the pre-treatment level in all three patients. Our observations may be related to the up-regulation of receptor-mediated 99mTc-GSA uptake during hepatic regeneration after proton beam therapy. [References: 27]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended

It was switched off for the last time in February 1984. In addition to the X-ray beam, electrons were used for treatment and for research, where the high dose rate and large field size were particularly useful. An account is given of some of the highlights of the clinical and research programmes

Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues	
0	187	Comparison of radiosurgery treatment modalities based on complication and control probabilities	Algorithms, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Probability, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage	PURPOSE: The relative efficacy of Gamma Knife, Linac, and Proton treatment modalities for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was investigated on the basis of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and tumor control probability (TCP), calculated for representative test cases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan	
0	4713	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry of the head and neck: a comparison of treatment plans using linear accelerator-based IMRT and helical tomotherapy	Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Methods, Neck, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Gland, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography,Spiral Computed/mt [Methods], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	PURPOSE: To date, most intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery has occurred using linear accelerators (linacs), although helical tomotherapy has become commercially available. To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands	
1	924	Influence of patient age on biochemical freedom from disease in patients undergoing conformal proton radiotherapy of organ-confined prostate cancer	Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Life Tables, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Survival, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVES: To examine a large, single-institution series of patients to test the perception among clinicians that radiotherapy is preferred for "older" patients and surgery should be indicated for "younger" men. Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another	
1	559	Combined proton beam radiotherapy and transpupillary thermotherapy for large uveal melanomas: a randomized study of 151 patients.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Female, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Informed Consent, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Pupil, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Retinal Detachment/pc [Prevention & Control], Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: Exudation from the tumour scar and glaucoma can be major problems after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma and can sometimes lead to secondary enucleation. We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy. Further studies should be performed to determine whether TTT could be beneficial to smaller tumours and to define its optimal dose. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel

Long-term results after proton beam irradiation: a report of 3 cases	Adult, Austria, Blindness/et [Etiology], Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Optic Disk, Optic Disk/re [Radiation Effects], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Universities	Three patients with choroidal melanomas of the posterior pole were treated with proton beam irradiation. One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now	
1	61	[Progress in optimizing dosimetry plans in stereotactic radiotherapy in the Salt Group (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon]. [French]	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/td [Trends], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	We began intracranial stereotactic irradiation under the direction of O Betti 11 years ago. At the present time, we believe it is interesting to present the methodologies of the SALT (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon) group. Up to the present time we have irradiated 693 patients using a single fraction. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represented the majority (90%) of treated lesions. Irradiation protocol has little changed since 1986, and the localization of the target volume was performed in the neurosurgery department of St Anne Hospital, France. The stereotactic images (computerized tomography [CT], angiography) were sent to the radiotherapy department of Tenon Hospital through the French public digital network NUMERIS. Protocol was realized using the stereotactic ARTEMIS-3D/Dosigray TPS. The lesion volume was filled by one or more spherical or elliptical subvolumes using the "Associated Target Methodology". The interactive adjustment of subvolumes was based on the 3D graphical representations of the lesion. The direct optimization of the irradiation space was performed by managing parameters provided by the DDB (Dosimetric Data Base) such as the number of arcs, their angular position, as well as the starting and the ending point of each arc. The evaluation of the calculated dose distribution was made using quantitative parameters. The second method of optimization was based on the minibeam intensity modulation using a mathematical theory of inverse problems and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. At the present time, due to technical reasons, linear accelerators do not permit the modulation of intensity of arctherapy. Thus we transformed the profiles of irregular forms into rectangular profiles of modulated ponderation, with each optimized plan being evaluated before its implementation. The criteria of evaluation were derived from the differential and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH). The DVHs permitted the evaluation of the volumes of underdosage and overdosage inside the lesion and in the healthy tissue, respectively. Using DVHs, we have defined parameters such as the conform factor and the homogeneity index. We stress that the methodology of protocol optimization is valid for single or multiple fractions as well as for intra- and extra-cranial irradiation

The local disease was controlled in 111 of these patients. This study reviews the 26 patients who have had their disease recur, and who have evaluable diagnostic studies to examine for probable causes of recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The histologies of the recurrent tumors were 21 non-chondroid chordomas, two chondroid chordomas, and three chondrosarcomas. The prescribed doses ranged from 67 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 72 CGE (average of 69 CGE). Doses to small regions of the tumor were deliberately reduced where they abutted certain normal tissues (brain stem, spinal cord, optic chiasm, and optic nerves) in order to keep these structures at acceptance dose levels. The first study, CT or MR scan, on which there was evidence of increase in tumor was carefully evaluated and that volume transferred to the CT scan on which the treatment plan had been developed. The 3D dose distribution in the region of recurrence was carefully analyzed and a judgement made as to the most probable cause of recurrence. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter (6 of 26) of the cases failed in the prescribed dose region. More than half (15 of 26) failed in regions where tumor dose was limited by normal tissue constraints. Approximately 10% of the patients recurred in the surgical pathway and 10% were judged to be marginal misses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 75% of the patients failed in regions receiving less than the prescribed dose. All tumors which failed in the high dose region had volume greater than 75 cc. Patients with cervical spine disease had a higher rate of recurrence (10 or 26) and larger tumors (average volume of 102 cc) than those with base of skull disease (16 of 115) with an average volume of 63 cc	
0	1141	Evaluation of therapeutic potential of heavy ion therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Feasibility Studies, Femur Head, Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Male, Motion, Movement, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of raster scanned heavy charged particle therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa,) with special regard to the influence of internal organ motion on the dose distribution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients

To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

0	1421	[Comparison with dose-volume histograms of two conformal irradiation techniques used for the treatment of T2N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer, one with association of photons and protons and another with photons alone]. [French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them	
1	534	The impact of IMRT and proton radiotherapy on secondary cancer incidence	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Incidence, Male, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Risk Factors, Scattering,Radiation, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is concern about the increase of radiation-induced malignancies with the application of modern radiation treatment techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and proton radiotherapy. Therefore, X-ray scatter and neutron radiation as well as the impact of the primary dose distribution on secondary cancer incidence are analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential and a plateau dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 30 patients who received radiation therapy of prostate cancer. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used in eleven patients, another eleven patients received IMRT with 6-MV photons, and eight patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. The treatment plans were recalculated with 15-MV and 18-MV photons. Secondary cancer risk was estimated based on the OED for the different treatment techniques. RESULTS: A modest increase of 15% radiation-induced cancer results from IMRT using low energies (6 MV), compared to conventional four-field planning with 15-MV photons (plateau dose-response: 1%). The probability to develop a secondary cancer increases with IMRT of higher energies by 20% and 60% for 15 MV and 18 MV, respectively (plateau dose-response: 2% and 30%). The use of spot-scanned protons can reduce secondary cancer incidence as much as 50% (independent of dose-response). CONCLUSION: By including the primary dose distribution into the analysis of radiation-induced cancer incidence, the resulting increase in risk for secondary cancer using modern treatment techniques such as IMRT is not as dramatic as expected from earlier studies. By using 6-MV photons, only a moderate risk increase is expected. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice in regard to secondary cancer incidence	
1	559	Combined proton beam radiotherapy and transpupillary thermotherapy for large uveal melanomas: a randomized study of 151 patients.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Female, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Informed Consent, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Pupil, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Retinal Detachment/pc [Prevention & Control], Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: Exudation from the tumour scar and glaucoma can be major problems after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma and can sometimes lead to secondary enucleation. We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy. Further studies should be performed to determine whether TTT could be beneficial to smaller tumours and to define its optimal dose. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

At 37.80 Gy, fields were reduced and a final tumor dose of 59.40 Gy in 33 fractions given in three and a half weeks. Fifty-six percent of patients had complete resolution of tumor; the overall local control rate was 52% with an average follow-up of 12.5 months. Actuarial survival was 74% at 12 months and 50% at 24 months. Disease-free survival was 48% at 12 months and 32% at 24 months. Acute complications were common, but late complications were rare, two cases of asymptomatic subcutaneous fibrosis. Radiation therapy with accelerated fractionation shows promise of improving the therapeutic ratio

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma	
1	1467	Acute radiation-induced toxicity of heavy ion radiotherapy delivered with intensity modulated pencil beam scanning in patients with base of skull tumors	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Erythema/et [Etiology], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Ions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Mastoiditis/et [Etiology], Middle Aged, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Sinusitis/et [Etiology], Skull Base Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stereotaxic Techniques	PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate acute radiation-induced toxicity of carbon ion therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 1997 to November 2000, 37 patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ions at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at GSI, Darmstadt. Tumor-conformal application of carbon beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning in combination with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. The treatment planning procedure included a biological plan optimization. We applied a cobalt-Gray equivalent dose of 60GyE. Acute toxicity was assessed according to the common toxicity criteria (CTC). RESULTS: Acute toxicity included skin reactions ( degrees I+ degrees II) in four patients, mucositis ( degrees I- degrees III) in eight patients, otitis and middle ear effusion in four, sinusitis in four, nausea/weight loss in one and edema of the temporal lobes in one patient. In two patients, preexisting neurological symptoms worsened. We did not observe acute morbidity > degrees III of normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Scanning beam delivery of heavy charged particles is safe and reliable. No unexpected acute dose limiting toxicity was observed. With regard to toxicity, a substantial improvement compared to passive beam shaping technology is achieved

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1989 through July 2000, 225 patients with HCC underwent their first course of proton beam therapy at the University of Tsukuba. Of them, 27 with 68 lesions who had undergone two or more courses were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Median interval between the first and second course was 24.5 months (range 3.3-79.8 months). Median total dose of 72 Gy in 16 fractions and 66 Gy in 16 fractions were given for the first course and the rest of the courses, respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate and median survival period from the beginning of the first course for the 27 patients were 55.6% and 62.2 months, respectively. Five-year local control rate for the 68 lesions was 87.8%. Of the patients, 1 with Child-Pugh class B and another with class C before the last course suffered from acute hepatic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated proton beam therapy for HCC is safe when the patient has a target in the peripheral region of the liver and liver function is Child-Pugh class A

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and December 2001, 74 patients were treated for chordomas and chondrosarcomas with carbon ion RT at the "Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung" (GSI). Seven patients reirradiated with reduced carbon ion doses after conventional RT were excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 evaluable patients (44 chordomas and 23 chondrosarcomas) who received a full course of carbon ion therapy. Tumor-conform application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with active energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included intensity modulation and biological plan optimization. A median dose of 60 GyE was applied to the target volume within 20 consecutive days at a dose of 3.0 GyE per fraction. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-46 months). At 3 years, actuarial local control was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 87% for chordomas, respectively. Partial tumor remission was observed in 14/44 (31%) chordoma patients and in 4/23 (17%) chondrosarcoma patients. At 3 years, actuarial overall survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 89% for chordomas, respectively. No severe side effects > CTC degrees III have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the clinical efficiency and safety of scanning beam delivery of carbon ion beams in patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. The observation of tumor regressions at a dose level of 60 GyE may indicate that the biological effectiveness of carbon ions in chordomas and chondrosarcomas is higher than initially estimated

The patient retained 6/7.5 visual acuity for 2 1/2 years before he was killed in an automobile accident. The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, 175 patients received C-ion RT using a recommended dose fractionation (66.0 GyE/20 fractions) established from prior studies. C-ion RT alone was performed for 33 patients constituting a low-risk group (Stage < or =T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml and Gleason score < or =6); the remaining 142 high-risk patients received an additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and bNED rates were 91% and 87%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all but one patient. The 4-year bNED rates were 87% in the low-risk group and 88% in the high-risk group. In very advanced diseases (Stage > or= T3a or PSA > or= 20 ng/ml or Gleason score > or =8), there was significant difference in the bNED rate according to period of ADT administration (ADT > or =24 months: 93%, ADT <24 months: 73%, p<0.01). Grade 2 late toxicities developed in 4 patients (2%) for the rectum and 9 patients (5%) for the genitourinary system but no Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of C-ion RT for prostate cancer has been well confirmed. Based on these results, new study of a C-ion RT modified for the administration strategy of ADT according to the patient risk has been started by dividing patients into 3 groups, high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk

Technique and radiobiologic implications	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Child, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation Dosage, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time	In the authors' technique, the stereotactically localized target is fixed to the isocenter of a 4 MV linear accelerator. The irradiation is carried out along 9-17 non-coplanar arcs distributed on a 160 degrees cylindrical sector. High doses (10-50 Gy) are delivered in one or two sessions. From 1982, 65 patients have been treated (shortest follow-up 6 months). The dose was chosen according to the pathology and to the volume of the lesion. Good clinical results have been obtained in low-grade gliomas, acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and other selected types of intracranial lesions. Therapeutic effects in terms of clinical condition and size of the lesions have been plotted in relation to time elapsed and dose employed

The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient). Complications following treatment with electrons to a spinal field are compared with reported complications following treatment with photons to the spinal field. Although short-term reactions were minimal, the authors found no difference in late complications. More sophisticated treatment planning may show such a long-term benefit in the future

This represents the largest group evaluated histologically in the literature and is the first report evaluating effects of particle radiation in pancreatic tissue. Patient survival after therapy averaged 9 months. Most died of infection and/or pulmonary emboli. Local control was achieved in 27%. The pancreatic tumors had histologically more severe radiation changes than nontumor bearing pancreas. Irradiated bone marrow was severely hypocellular, and irradiated skin was atrophic. Five patients had radiation injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal cord, liver, and kidneys showed no damage. This study demonstrates the safety of helium particle irradiation with present therapeutic planning. Injury to tumor was seen without excessive damage to adjacent tissues

METHODS: A patient experienced persistent unilateral panuveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. Inflammation and pressure worsened after cataract extraction and lens implantation. Diagnostic vitrectomy was non-revealing. RESULTS: Repeat vitrectomy and lens implant removal revealed a ciliary body mass, suggestive of melanoma. Ultrasonography and clinical evaluation by the retinal oncologists supported this diagnosis. The uveitis persisted despite aggressive medical treatments, including methotrexate. Proton beam irradiation of the melanoma led to resolution of uveitis and restoration of normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Ciliary body melanoma can present as chronic uveitis and refractory glaucoma

The advent of localized proton spectroscopy has made this detection possible. The spectral peak intensities were found to be very different depending on tumor tissue pathology. METHODS: The tumor cell reaction after radiation therapy was examined with proton localized spectroscopy in addition to enhanced MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips, Gyroscan S15-HP). Plain MR images (short spin echo) were used for localization pilot images, and after the MRS study, contrast enhanced MRI was carried out. Studies were performed pre-radiation, mid-radiation, and post-radiation if possible. MATERIALS: Sixteen patients (total 27 examinations) with intracranial tumors and three normal volunteers underwent proton NMR localized spectroscopy. The brain tumors were diagnosed before the MR study, and nine patients had metastatic brain tumors, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, and seven other patients were diagnosed with glioma-type tumors. RESULTS: The reaction patterns of proton NMR spectroscopy of brain tumors after radiation therapy were very different and depended on tumor histology. CONCLUSION: Proton NMR spectroscopy is an excellent means of determining tumor cell viability

METHODS: Thirty-six patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery, and with conventional magnetic resonance imaging examinations at regular time intervals until the initiation of a new treatment strategy. Patients were categorized on the basis of their initial spectroscopic results, and their performance was assessed in terms of change in contrast-enhancing volume, time to further treatment, and survival. RESULTS: The trends in the overall population were toward more extensive increase in the percent contrast-enhancing volume, a decreased time to further treatment, and a reduced survival time for patients with more extensive initial metabolic abnormalities. Statistical analysis of the subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme found a significant increase in relative contrast-enhancing volume (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), a decrease in time to further treatment (P < 0.01, log-rank test), and a reduction in survival time (P < 0.01, log-rank test) for patients with regions containing tumor-suggestive spectra outside the gamma knife target, compared with patients exhibiting spectral abnormalities restricted to the gamma knife target. Further studies are needed to establish statistical significance for patients with lower-grade lesions and to confirm the results observed in this study. CONCLUSION: The pretreatment spectroscopic results provided information that was predictive of outcome for this patient pool, both in local control (change in contrast-enhancing volume) and global outcome (time to further treatment and survival). This modality may have an important role in improving the selection, planning, and treatment process for glioma patients	
0	1826	[The role of intraoperative radiotherapy in oncological pediatric surgery]. [Spanish]	Adolescent, Child, Child,Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Intraoperative Care, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Risk	Conventional external beam radiation has proved its profit in pediatric tumors; but its complications have limited it in therapeutical approach. Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients.

Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma	
0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

In that survival rate radiotherapy takes part in 15%. By further development of radiological methods and techniques radiotherapy gains significance in the recent time. Optimizing radiation planning and tactics, all modern imaging techniques are applied consequently. The radiotherapist must be able to asses their immanent specifity which should remain object of the radiological training, even if separated into therapy and diagnostics. Dose distribution is calculated by computer; three-dimensional planning is done in tumors of the mediastinum, oesophagus carcinoma and paraaortic lymphomas. Critical description of radiation techniques, results, problems and prognoses are given by results in tumors of the epipharynx and gastric cancer. After-loading, done until now only in gynaecological tumors, is performed in recurrences of pharyngeal tumors by individually shaped applicators. Reducing the number of therapy failures as well as possible, the application of higher tumor doses, new kinds of rays as neutrons and combinations with physical and chemical methods is outlined. Modifications of radiation volumes are discussed, especially the irradiation of the complete abdomen in ovarian cancer, the irradiation of the complete body surface by electrons in mycosis fungoides, and the total body irradiation prior to autologue bone marrow transplantation. Modifications of fractionation are shown in short-time radiation of bone metastases and single-time radiation of brain lesions. Low penetrating electron therapy facilitates intraoperative single-time irradiation. Because of higher biological efficiency neutrons and heavy ions allow to irradiate low sensible tumors or recurrences embedded in fibrotic tissue respectively. The combination with hyperthermia yields good results in tumors of the head and neck with better local response and total remissions of 59%. There are potentials in synchronising with chemotherapeutics. Remissions of different duration were achieved in 190 patients. Because of neutrotoxicity there are still problems in applicating radiosensitizers. New methods are applied treating endocrine active tumors by labelled hormone precursers. [References: 27]

We treated nine AVM, 12 metastatic brain tumors, two malignant lymphomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, two meningiomas, and one brain tumor of unknown pathology. In the follow-up examinations at least five months after treatment, the local control rate was 83% for the metastatic tumors, and two malignant lymphomas disappeared completely. In addition, satisfactory results have been obtained with AVM and other brain tumors without any side effects. In comparison with gamma-knife radiosurgery, linac radiosurgery has some disadvantages such as longer treatment time and cumbersome accuracy control, but if accuracy control is performed periodically, accuracies of 1 mm or less can be obtained. There is some strengths of linac radiosurgery as follow. 1) The acquisition cost is relatively low. 2) Dose distribution are equivalent to gamma-knife. 3) There is no field size limitation. 4) There is great flexibility in beam delivery and linac systems. Radiosurgery using linear accelerators seems to become widely accepted in the future

As of 9/92 a total of 28 patients suffering from peripheral (n = 20) or centrally (n = 8) located soft tissue sarcomas had been were treated. Thirteen patients revealed a primary and 15 patients a recurrent tumor. Tumor resection with negative margins was performed in 20 patients, positive margins remained in 5 patients, and gross macroscopic residual disease in 3 patients. Combined intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy was applied in 22 patients, using IORT doses of 10-20 Gy and an external beam dose of 26-50 Gy. Three patients were irradiated intraoperatively twice with a time interval of 24 h. After a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 20 patients are disease free. Two patients died 4 and 5 months after the end of therapy with rapidly progressive distant metastases. An infield failure within the external beam target volume was seen in 1 patient and local failure at the field margin of the external field in 3 patients. So far, there have been no IORT infield failures. Follow-up is performed with magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 patients a second operation was necessary because of a severe wound infection, including one patient suffering from osteomyelitis of a neighboring bone. Mild sensory neuropathy occurred in 1 patient 7 months after treatment. Overall only mild and reversible postoperative and posttherapeutic complications were seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment.

The NIRS (National Institute For Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan) was the first dedicated medical centre for cancer with more than 1200 patients exclusively treated with carbon ion from 1994. A three-year 70 to 100% local control was reported for radio-resistant cancers, supporting the use of high LET particles. Hypo-fractionation was particularly explored for lung cancers and hepatocarcinoma (4 sessions only). Dose escalation studies demonstrated a tumour dose-effect and permitted to precise dose constraints for healthy tissues especially for the rectum. More than 140 patients were treated with carbon ion exclusively or associated with photons since 1997 in the GSI laboratory Gesellschaft Fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany). A very high local control was also obtained for radioresistant cancer of the base of the skull. Preliminary clinical data seem to confirm the expected therapeutic gain with light ions, due to their ballistic and radio-biological properties, and justify the European projects for the construction of dedicated medical facilities for cancers. The French "Etoile" project will be integrated in the European hadrontherapy network "Enlight", with the objectives to coordinate technologic, medical and economic features

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HCC for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy. Four patients had renal failure, 2 patients had severe heart disease, 9 patients had severe cirrhosis, 1 patient had aplastic anemia, 1 patient had a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm before treatment, and 4 patients had bleeding tendency or unresectable tumors. Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to iodine, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the tumors ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm). No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for tumor treatments. RESULTS: All but 1 of the irradiated tumors were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years. Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant metastases in the lungs. Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and all recurrent tumors were controlled. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively. Grade > or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with HCC. The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with HCC who had limited treatment options. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society

METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 65 women (age 25-70 years, mean 47 years) with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB were initially treated with external beam radiotherapy on a telecobalt or 6 MV linear accelerator to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 5-6 weeks. After 2-3 weeks of completing external radiation, patients received interstitial brachytherapy with Iridium-192 (activity 0.5-1 mCi/cm) using a Syed-Neblett perineal template. The median dose delivered to the implant volume was 24 Gy (range 20-32 Gy) delivered at an average dose rate of 0.70 Gy/h (range 0.40-1.20 Gy/h). A point defined at 1.5 cm lateral to the central uterine tandem at the level of os was taken as a representative for assessing the dose to the cervix. Mean doses delivered by interstitial brachytherapy to point A, cervix, point B and rectum were 38 Gy, 34 Gy, 16 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 53 months, the actuarial disease free survival and overall survival for 65 patients at both 5 and 10 years was 64% and 44%, respectively. Response to radiotherapy was a strong predictor of local control with 82% of patients continuing to have pelvic control after initial complete response. Overall, nine (14%) patients had persistent disease, ten (15%) developed a central recurrence after initial control and three patients developed distant metastasis on follow-up. No patient had any immediate treatment-related complication. Late toxicity included grade I-II rectal reactions in five patients and grade IV bladder complication (vesico-vaginal fistula) in two patients. 5 years after treatment, one patient developed intestinal obstruction, which was relieved after conservative management. Two patients developed vaginal stenosis. The 5- and 10-year disease free survival was 48% in patients aged less than 45 years as compared to 80% in patients of more than 45 years (p = 0.009). Dose to the cervical point was a prognostic indicator with 5- and 10-year disease free survival of 47% in patients who received < 35 Gy in comparison to 80% in patients who had > 35 Gy (p = 0.03). There was no difference in local control and survival in patients with minimal and moderate parametrial involvement. Bulky disease (> 4 cm) at presentation and a longer gap between external radiation and brachytherapy showed a trend towards inferior local control. CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial brachytherapy after external beam irradiation in patients with cervical carcinoma Stage IIB results in acceptable local control, survival and complication rates. Increased dose to the cervical disease results in improved local control and survival and should therefore be considered while optimizing brachytherapy treatment plans. Comparison of the results with those of standard intracavitary therapy remains to be proven in a randomized trial	
1	606	The potential of proton beam therapy in paediatric cancer. [Review] [64 refs]	Child, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Health Care Costs/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Medulloblastoma/ec [Economics], Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/pc [Prevention & Control], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sweden	A group of Swedish oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that in paediatric cancers, proton beams are of potential importance in 80-100 children annually in Sweden. About 20 of the patients have medulloblastoma. The main purpose is to reduce late sequelae, but these are also increased chances to avoid myelosupression during e.g. concomitant chemo-radiation and to further intensify the chemotherapy.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities	
0	4712	Use of peripheral dose data from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation fields to estimate out-of-field organ dose in patients treated employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy	Head, Humans, India, Indium, Jaw, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Scattering,Radiation, Time, Water, Whole-Body Counting, X-Rays	Peripheral doses (PD) from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) fields were measured for 6 MV x-rays on a Varian linear accelerator using a 0.6 cc ionization chamber inserted at 5 cm depth into a 35 x 35 x 105 cm3 plastic water phantom. PD measurements were also carried out under identical conditions for seven patients treated for head and neck and cervical cancer employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The measured PD from these patient-specific intensity-modulated beams (IMBs) were compared with the corresponding data from uniform DMLC fields having similar jaws setting. The measured PD per monitor unit (PD/MU) decreases almost exponentially with out-of-field distance for all uniform DMLC and static fields. For the same strip field width of 1.2 cm, uniform DMLC fields with a larger size of 14 x 22 cm2 deliver an average of 3.51 (SD = 0.51) times higher PD/MU at all out-of-field distances compared to 6 x 6 cm2. Similar to uniform DMLC fields, PD/MU measured from different patient-specific IMBs was found to decrease almost exponentially with out-of-field distance and increase with increase in field dimension. PD per MU from uniform DMLC fields and patient-specific IMBs having similar jaws setting shows good agreement (+/-7%) except at the most proximal distance, where a variation of more than 10% (maximum 15%) was observed. Our study shows that PD data generated from uniform DMLC fields can be used as baseline data to estimate out-of-field critical organ or whole-body dose in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT if an appropriate correction factor for field dimension is applied. The whole-body dose information can be used to estimate the possible increase in risk of fatal secondary malignancy in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation	
1	1210	Optimization of physical dose distributions with hadron beams: comparing photon IMRT with IMPT	Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Carbon/ch [Chemistry], Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Germany, Humans, Ions, Ions/ch [Chemistry], Lead, Light, Male, Movement, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology/is [Instrumentation], Radiation Oncology/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Risk, Time	Intensity modulated radiotherapy with high enery photons (IMRT) and with charged particles (IMPT) refer to the most advanced development in conformal radiation therapy. Their general aim is to increase local tumor control rates while keeping the radiation induced complications below desired thresholds. IMRT is currently widely introduced in clinical practice. However, the more complicated IMPT is still under development. Especially, spot- scanning techniques integrated in rotating gantries that can deliver proton or light ion-beams to a radiation target from any direction will be available in the near future. We describe the basic concepts of intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT). Starting from the potential advantages of hadron therapy inverse treatment planning strategies are discussed for various dose delivery techniques of IMPT. Of special interest are the techniques of distal edge tracking (DET) and 3D-scanning. After the introduction of these concepts a study of comparative inverse treatment planning is presented. The study aims to identify the potential advantages of achievable physical dose distributions with proton and carbon beams, if different dose delivery techniques are employed. Moreover, a comparison to standard photon IMRT is performed. The results of the study are summarized as: i) IMRT with photon beams is a strong competitor to intensity modulated radiotherapy with charged particles. The most obvious benefit observed for charged particles is the reduction of medium and low doses in organs at risk. ii) The 3D-scanning technique could not improve the dosimetric results achieved with DET, although 10-15 times more beam spots were employed for 3D-scanning than for DET. However, concerns may arise about the application of DET, if positioning errors of the patient or organ movements have to be accounted for. iii) Replacing protons with carbon ions leads to further improvements of the physical dose distributions. However, the additional degree of improvement due to carbon ions is modest. The main clinical potential of heavy ion beams is probably related to their radiobiological properties

All the patients were in complete remission at the time of irradiation. Shielding of the kidneys was effected at the start of treatment and the right lobe of the liver was shielded after a dose of 20 Gy was delivered. As of January 1982, 17 of the patients were alive and free of disease with a follow-up ranging from 6 to 32 months (mean follow-up of 18.5 months). Two patients were dead from their disease. Alterations in liver chemistry were observed in 5 patients, clinical jaundice or transient hepatomegaly along with changes in liver chemistry in 4 patients, classical veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients and 7 of the patients did not develop any complication. No death from complications were observed. The contribution of the following factors such as radiotherapy dose to the liver, drugs, nutritional status and associated medical conditions, towards the development of complications have been analyzed in detail

Six patients had positron emission tomography 15 to 25 minutes after radiation therapy with a 42 MeV accelerator. Five patients had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and one required therapy for a carcinoma of the common bile duct. We sought to determine whether state-of-the-art PET technology could be used to monitor the three-dimensional activity distribution of radiation-induced radioactivity. At the time of the examination all six patients had sufficient concentrations of C-11 and N-13 activity in the irradiated volume to permit the evaluation of the activity distribution. We found significant activity at the body surface, which permitted field delineation. We conclude that the in vivo generated radioactivity can be monitored with PET

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy

The dilemma of whether to treat by primary irradiation or by conservative surgery is not yet solved. In this study, 67 patients were treated between 1967 and 1987 for anterior commissure carcinoma of the larynx. Radiation was used with 47 patients and conservation surgery with 20 patients. Initial lesion control was achieved with 72% of the patients treated by primary irradiation. Conservation surgery, when used as a primary treatment modality, achieved local control in 90% of the patients. The new techniques of reconstruction of the larynx enhance the surgeon's ability, strengthen his conviction to proceed to enlarged partial laryngectomies, and thus improve the oncologic control of the anterior commissure carcinoma as well

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 53 intracranial AVMs treated between 1991-1998. HFSR was selected for 26 AVMs with a maximum diameter > or 2.5 cm or at eloquent area. Twenty-seven patients were treated with SRS (18 AVMs < 2.5 cm at non-eloquent area, nine patients who were unfit for prolonged ring-wearing). The most frequent minimum dose (Dmin) was 20 Gy for SRS and 28 Gy for HFSR in four fractions. The mean follow-up duration was 34.6 months for SRS and 35.4 months for HFSR. RESULTS: As a whole, the 3 and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 64 and 92%. Age <20 years old (P=0.02) and a maximum diameter <2 cm were favorable factors (P=0.05). A difference in the distribution of patients was observed in size (> or =2.5 cm or not) (P<0.001) and location (eloquent or not) (P<0.001) between SRS and HFSR due to the treatment selection. However, no significant differences were observed in the actuarial rates of obliteration and transient increased signals with T2-weighted MR images between SRS and HFSR. Radiation necrosis occurred in two patients treated with SRS and in none with HFSR. Intracranial hemorrhage after treatment happened in two treated with SRS and three with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: HFSR appears to be at least as effective as SRS in achieving complete obliteration of intracranial AVM, although its definitive role remains to be investigated

Hyperprolactinemia of various degrees was observed in 11 of 13 patients (84%). The summary index SFM (the male sexual formula) and a PRL level showed negative correlation. There was no significant difference in LH response to LH-RH administration between patients with normal and disturbed sexual function. Radiation therapy, in particular proton-beam therapy, produced no negative influence on male sexual function in a long-term period after therapy

AOVMs were located in the brainstem (19), thalamus or internal capsule (9), basal ganglia (3), deep cerebral hemisphere and motor area (3), or cerebellopontine angle (1). All patients presented with clinical and radiological evidence of previous hemorrhage, usually with multiple episodes of hemorrhage. Treatment volumes ranged from 80 to 15,200 mm3 and treatment doses from 7.7 to 34.6 Gy. Mean follow-up was 40 months, with 31 patients followed for at least 2 years. Clinical outcome was excellent in 46%, good in 34% and poor in 14%; 6% died. Twenty-seven patients in excellent and good condition prior to treatment remained stable or improved neurologically. Two patients initially in poor condition, who had previously received conventional radiotherapy, died at 9 and 14 months after treatment, respectively. Six patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage 2-60 months following treatment. Three of these patients made a complete recovery. Although a larger number of treated patients must be followed over longer periods of time, stereotactic heavy-particle radiotherapy may be a valuable treatment modality for surgically inaccessible intracranial AOVMs

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects	
1	1122	Noninvasive linear accelerator radiosurgery as the primary treatment for trigeminal neuralgia	Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Treatment Outcome, Trigeminal Neuralgia/su [Surgery]	The application of a dedicated linear accelerator (DLINAC) as a noninvasive surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia has not yet been demonstrated. This work evaluates the outcome and indications of 22 patients submitted to DLINAC radiosurgery as a primary treatment for essential trigeminal neuralgia. At last follow-up evaluation, 21 patients (95.5%) had sustained significant pain relief. DLINAC radiosurgery is safe and effective as a primary noninvasive surgical treatment for selected patients with essential trigeminal neuralgia

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

Three regimens of fractionation were used: (1) accelerated fractionation (AF)--(133), 2.5 Gy, 3 days a week, to a total of 47.5--55 Gy; (2) accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF)--(93), 1.25 Gy, daily, to a total of 60-72.5 Gy and standard fractionation (SF)--(149), 2 Gy, daily, to a total of 58-68 Gy. The advantages of AHF were established as regards complete regression rate (54.9% vs. 18.6%--SF and 18.1%--AF; p(0.001), median survival (30.5(2.4 months vs. 18.9 (1%--SF (p = 0.004) and 20.4 (2.4--AF (p = 0.004)), and 3-year survival (36.6% vs. 16.7%--SF (p = 0.005) and 15.5%--AF (p = 0.005). 17.9%, 9.0% (p = 0.11) and 8.1% (p = 0.08) have survived, respectively. Overall survival in the AHF group was superior in stages IIB--III; in stage I, the results were identical. Immediate response to radical radiotherapy appeared the only statistically significant factor of survival (p = 0.005-0.008) in all the groups

These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team

[Italian]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Intraoperative Care, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Time, Wound Healing	We evaluated the tolerance of a single dose of 800-1500 cGy, delivered with an electron beam from an IOERT-dedicated linear accelerator to the tumour bed in patients with breast cancer undergoing conservative treatment, instead of the traditional boost. We enrolled 27 patients (cT1-2, cN0). The first 6 received a dose of 800 cGy, 6 1000 cGy, 10 1200 cGy and 5 1500 cGy. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with a conventional schedule, 4000 cGy total dose, was performed after wound healing. The median gap between IOERT and EBRT was 8 weeks. Three patients with adverse prognostic factors undergoing chemotherapy, including doxorubicin or taxanes, received EBRT after completion of chemotherapy. One patient with a prosthesis implant had yielding of the surgical scar 8 months after IOERT (after 4 cycles of doxorubicin and 4 cycles of CMF complicated by frequent mastitis). Another patient with a large serum collection in the axilla manifested delayed scar formation. In the others no significant increase in healing time or surgery-related morbidity was observed. Another 4 patients developed mastitis. The cosmetic outcome was good in 26/27 patients. This treatment is well tolerated at all IOERT doses delivered. In the follow-up, to date, there have been no local relapses

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 51 NSCLC patients were treated with proton beams at the University of Tsukuba. There were 28 patients in Stage I, 9 in Stage II, 8 in Stage III, 1 in Stage IV, and 5 with recurrent disease. Thirty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 17 had adenocarcinoma, and 1 had large-cell carcinoma. Median fraction and total doses given were 3.0 Gy (range 2.0-6.0 Gy), and 76.0 Gy (range 49.0-93.0 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 29% for all patients, 70% for 9 Stage IA patients, and 16% for 19 Stage IB patients, respectively (IA vs. IB: p < 0.05). The 5-year in-field local control rate was higher in patients with Stage IA (89%) when compared with those with Stage IB (39%). Forty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute lung toxicity of Grade 1 or less; 3 had Grade 2, 1 had Grade 3, and none experienced Grade 4 or higher. Patients in the present series showed very little late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is a very safe and effective treatment for patients with NSCLC, especially for those with early stages. The relative merit of proton therapy in comparison with stereotactic photon radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy remains to be defined through future clinical trials

We present a case report that appears to contradict this doctrine. The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and was treated with surgical resection and postoperative proton-beam radiation therapy. Approximately 16 mo after completion of therapy, MRI demonstrated two new regions of enhancement, and an FDG-PET study was performed to further characterize these lesions. FDG-PET demonstrated an area of intense hypermetabolism, and wide surgical resection was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed reactive changes and areas of necrosis. There was no evidence of either recurrent or radiation-induced tumor

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation

These patients refuse to go in to surgery or have indications for surgery (183 patients--T(1-4)N(0-3)M(0-1)). This method consists of the combination of the traditional method of the whole breast and/or nodal photon irradiation with local highly concentrated proton irradiation in the dosage iso-equivalent to tumor (proton with energy from 130 to 180 MeV, with stop in the target in notice depth). We used the irradiation of the adenohypophysis with narrow proton beams energy 200 MeV. The aim of the first combination of the components is the selectively influence on the target and the channeling to the tumor and its subclinical substances the dosages sufficient for the total irradiation of tumor with sparing surrounding tissues and parts of body. The goal of irradiation of adenohypophysis with protons is the normalization of its hormonal activity and elimination of factors stimulating growth of tumor cells in case of dishormonal cancer. The suggested method didu't only improve the results of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, but also contributed to the reducing of the emotional stress. We received high results of the patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer of criteria: local control rate (96%), long remission (more then 40%) and 5-year actuarial survival rate (83%). The patients examined during 5 and 18 years. It made a good cosmetic effect and high quality life of the patients with breast cancer

At present there are approximately 20 active protocols, some specifying radio-oncological study questions, in which about 500 to 600 children annually are given radiotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Pediatric Radiation Oncology Working Group (APRO) of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) represents the organizational link between GPOH and DEGRO. Their activities range from phrasing guidelines of radio-oncological therapy, through writing a protocol for a prospective study on radiation-induced late effects (RISK--in co-operation with GPOH, 695 patients registered so far) and organizing meetings for information transfer, to implementing radio-oncology within the prospective studies of the GPOH by establishing study chairs for radio-oncology when radio-oncological questions are a primary focus and/or to function as a reference institution for quality assurance. These activities also include individual case consultations outside the study proper. Twice annually the members of the APRO meet for an update on current knowledge and future directions where a representative of the GPOH is invited to contribute special aspects of pediatric oncology. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, modern technology (intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, inclusion of imaging in treatment planning) will be part of disease management in pediatric oncology. A working group for modern radiotherapy technology was established to enhance this development. Prospective studies of the GPOH with primary or secondary radio-oncological questions require the implementation of corresponding tasks (documentation, monitoring, etc.) in order to meet future demands on clinical trials and to achieve the aims of the protocol. Consequently adequate financial support is indispensable

Xerostomia is a serious, permanent, and ubiquitous sequelae in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This study was designed to investigate the severity of xerostomia and its impact on the quality of life in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated by conventional radiation therapy in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, were surveyed by interview at the outpatient. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analysis of xerostomia and xerostomia-related problems. RESULTS: Of 136 patents, 73.5% of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. 82.4% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate speech; 92.6% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate chewing and swallowing; 91.2% of the patients changed their feeding pattern (can eat only mashed food); 61.3% of the patients had to wake up to drink water because of dry mouth; 75.0% of the patients had teeth deteriorated. CONCLUSION: 73.5% of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. Xerostomia has a significant impact on the patient's speech, deglutition, sleep, and increases the morbidity rate of the tooth

0	1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses

We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors.

Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been recognized as a clinicopathologic entity distinct from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapy, and prognosis of ESCC. METHODS: The medical records, from Jan. 1985 to Dec. 2005, of 53 patients with pathologically proved ESCC were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 39 were men and 14 were women, with the median age of 53 years (range, 27-76 years). Of the 53 cases of ESCC, 33 (62.3%) were detected in the esophagus, 5 in the cervix, 4 in the larynx, 3 in the pharynx, 2 in the upper sinus, 2 in the rectum and sublingual gland, 1 in the thyroid gland, 1 in the pleura, and 1 in the liver. Forty patients (75.5%) had limited disease (LD) and 13 (24.5%) had extensive disease (ED). Patients with ED mostly received platinum-based chemotherapy, for which the response rate was 69.2%. Patients with LD were treated with a variety of therapeutic modalities: 7 were treated with surgery plus radiochemotherapy, 3 with surgery plus radiotherapy, 18 with surgery plus chemotherapy, 6 with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, 4 with radiotherapy alone, and 2 with chemotherapy alone. The median survival time (MST) was 20 months for all patients, and the 1-and 3-year survival rates were 41.3% and 31.4%. MST for patients with ED and LD were 15 months and 26 months, respectively, and 1-and 3-year survival rates were 51.1% vs. 14.4%, and 42.5% vs. 0% (P=0.017 ). CONCLUSIONS: ESCC is identified in various sites, with the most common primary site being the esophagus. Multimodality therapy has become increasingly used for the majority of patients with LD-ESCC. Combination chemotherapy has been a major treatment for patients with ED-ESCC. Generally, the prognosis of LD-ESCC is significantly superior to ED-ESCC

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

Until radiation therapy gained wide acceptance in the 1980s, enucleation was the standard treatment for the tumor. Long-term results after proton beam irradiation are now available. METHODS: We developed risk score equations to estimate probabilities of the 4 principal treatment outcomes-local tumor recurrence, death from metastasis, retention of the treated eye, and vision loss-based on an analysis of 2069 patients treated with proton beam radiation for intraocular melanoma between July 10, 1975, and December 31, 1997. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 9.4 years. RESULTS: Tumor regrowth occurred in 60 patients, and 95% of tumors (95% confidence interval, 93%-96%) were controlled locally at 15 years. Risk scores were developed for the other 3 outcomes studied. Overall, the treated eye was retained by 84% of patients (95% confidence interval, 80%-87%) at 15 years. The probabilities for vision loss (visual acuity worse than 20/200) ranged from 100% to 20% at 10 years and for death from tumor metastases from 95% to 35% at 15 years, depending on the risk group. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose radiation treatment was highly effective in achieving local control of intraocular melanomas. In most cases, the eye was salvaged, and functional vision was retained in many patients. The mortality rate was high in an identifiable subset of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapies directed at microscopic liver metastases	
0	2200	The role of proton therapy in the treatment of large irradiation volumes: a comparative planning study of pancreatic and biliary tumors.[see comment]	Algorithms, Bile Duct Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Bile Duct Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Italy, Kidney, Liver, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Staging, Pancreatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Time, Universities, Vascular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Vascular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vena Cava,Inferior	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefit of proton therapy for abdominal tumors. Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues

METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma

Feasibility and initial results	Aged, Feasibility Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Mesothelioma/mo [Mortality], Mesothelioma/ra [Radiography], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Pleural Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pleural Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pleural Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiography,Thoracic, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Software, Survival, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complex-shaped malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) with challenging volumes are extremely difficult to treat by conventional radiotherapy due to tolerance doses of the surrounding normal tissue. In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT	
1	2094	Conformal proton beam therapy of prostate cancer--update on the Loma Linda University medical center experience	Actuarial Analysis, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: The ability to eradicate localized prostate cancer is dependent upon the radiation dose which can be delivered to the prostate. This dose is often limited by the tolerance of normal organs (rectum, bladder). Conformal beam therapy takes advantage of the unique depth dose characteristics of heavy charged particles (the Bragg Peak) to escalate the radiation dose delivered to the prostate while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. METHOD: 643 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons alone or a combination of protons and photons. All treatment was planned on a 3-D planning system and all received doses between 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE/day. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response to treatment. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates for the entire group are 89 and 79% respectively. A statistically significant difference in biochemical disease-free survival was seen between patients in the "early" (T1b-2b, PSA < 15) and "advanced" (T1b-2b, PSA > 15 or T2c-T4, PSA < 50) subgroups (89% vs. 68% at 4.5 years, p < 0.001). A PSA nadir of less than 0.51 ng/ml predicted for the highest chance of freedom from biochemical recurrence. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton beams therapy produced high rates of response and minimal toxicity. A phase III dose escalation trial is in progress to help define the optimum radiation dose for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation	
1	3156	Significance of initial "performance status" in patients receiving halfbody radiation	Female, Humans, Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Palliative Care/mt [Methods], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Survival, Time	The excellent palliative value of halfbody radiation is well documented. The optimum time to use this modality for palliation of symptoms is unclear. Our department treated 44 evaluable patients with upper and lower halfbody radiation. Stratification according to a modified Karnofsky performance scale revealed an 86% response with a notable increase in median duration of survival in those patients exhibiting an initial performance scale of -1. The optimum benefit from halfbody irradiation is derived when administered at the earliest indicated time

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients	
0	4624	Proton or stereotactic photon irradiation for posterior uveal melanoma? A planning intercomparison	Berlin, Eye Injuries/et [Etiology], Eye Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Fovea Centralis, Germany, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Methods, Optic Disk, Optic Nerve, Patients, Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Safety, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton and stereotactic radiotherapy with photons (SRT) are both used to treat choroidal melanomas in proximity to optic disk and fovea centralis, a situation where plaque therapy is prone to complications. A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated	
1	2172	Phacoemulsification following treatment of choroidal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Berlin, Brachytherapy, Cataract Extraction, Choroid Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Eye Enucleation, Germany, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Lens Implantation,Intraocular, Melanoma, Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Phacoemulsification, Postoperative Care, Postoperative Complications, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Retreatment, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risks, effects and results of phacoemulsification following treatment with different modalities of choroidal melanoma. METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery	
1	2193	Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with linear accelerator for uveal melanoma--preliminary Vienna results	Austria, Ciliary Body, Dose Fractionation, Eye, Fixation,Ocular, Follow-Up Studies, France, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Melanoma, Melanoma/pp [Physiopathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Safety, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Video Recording	PURPOSE: To study local tumor control and radiogenic side-effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and February 1998, 21 patients suffering from uveal melanomas have been treated with stereotactic 6 MeV LINAC (Saturne 43, General Electric, France) in conjunction with a stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB, Germany). Immobilization of the eye was ensured with an optical fixation system which was proven reliable. During radiotherapy, movements of the irradiated eye were controlled on a monitor and documented by video recording. All patients co-operated very well with the optical fixation system. In 1164 measurements, the median value of horizontal deviation of the diseased eye during treatment was 0.3 mm (range: 0 to 1.3 mm). Median vertical deviation was 0.2 mm (range: 0 to 1.2 mm). For all patients, mean tumor prominence before treatment was 6.0 +/- 2.2 mm. In 20 patients, the total dose of 70 Gy (at 80%) was delivered in 5 fractions within 10 days. In one patient with a ciliary body tumor, the total dose of 70 Gy was divided into 7 fractions for better sparing of the anterior eye segment. RESULTS: After a follow-up of at least 6 months, local tumor control was seen in all eyes. Mean tumor thickness reduction after 3, 6 and 9 months was 7%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Up to now, only mild subacute side-effects located in the anterior eye segment have been noticed. CONCLUSION: Optical fixation of the eye allows high precision stereotactic radiotherapy with small safety margins. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and 70 Gy total dose delivered in 5 fractions seems to be appropriate for local tumor control in uveal melanoma. Further long-term studies with extended number of patients will be necessary to conclude on the use of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma

Focussed accelerated helium ion beams derived from charged-particle cyclotrons are stereotactically directed into the brain to obliterate abnormal shunts. Treated patients demonstrate delayed changes in brain anatomy and function that occur months to years after radiosurgery. The underlying mechanisms of the brain's delayed reaction to charged-particle radiosurgery involve complex perturbations in cerebrovascular and metabolic function. This report describes the wide range of delayed reactions that may occur in the brain after radiosurgery, including hemodynamic changes, blood-brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema, metabolic suppression, and parenchymal necrosis. These delayed reactions to injury in the brain involve potential target cells that include cerebral endothelial cells, oligodendroglia and astrocytes	
1	638	Hypofractionated radiotherapy with carbon ion beams for prostate cancer	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Dose Fractionation, Humans, Incidence, Male, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Research, Survival Analysis	PURPOSE: Analysis of the results of hypofractionated conformal carbon ion radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer was performed, with special regard to normal tissue morbidity and biochemical relapse-free rate (bNED). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer	
1	1227	Proton beam therapy with high-dose irradiation for superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Esophageal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: With the aim of improving the results of treatment for esophageal carcinoma, we have investigated the efficacy and toxicity associated with the use of a 250-MeV proton beam for radical radiation therapy in esophageal carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas	
0	3199	Diagnosis of delayed cerebral radiation necrosis following proton beam therapy	Adult, Brain/ra [Radiography], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Brain/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Necrosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Risk, Risk Factors, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Veterans	A 27-year-old man developed delayed cerebral radiation necrosis following proton beam therapy to an arteriovenous malformation. Neuroimaging with technetium 99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid and positron emission tomographic scanning with fludeoxyglucose F 18 aided in his evaluation. Significant improvement of his neurologic deficits resulted from corticosteroid therapy. Clinical resolution was corroborated by serial computed tomographic scans demonstrating regression of the abnormality (a mass lesion). Various facets of radiation injury are discussed, including pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and therapy	
1	3226	[Stereotactically targeted radiotherapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations]. [German]	Adult, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	A report is given about radiotherapy in 41 patients suffering from cerebral vessel anomalies. A modified linear accelerator was used in a moving field technique with multiple pendulum planes to apply single doses between 8 and 28 Gy by means of stereotaxis into the angiographically determined target volume. The medium follow-up is 23 months. The latency of radiogenic effects is between one and two years. Radiological controls with an interval of more than 18 months after therapy are available in 17 out of 41 patients. Angiographic investigation showed complete obliterations of pathological vessels in six out of these patients and partial obliterations in six patients; five patients remained unchanged. There were no acute complications. Seven patients presented neurological deficiencies with a latency of 6 to 12 months, however, in all cases but one they regressed completely. Even taking into consideration the small number of patients and the short time of observation, a comparison with the results of other radiotherapeutical proceedings allows to draw the conclusion that the presented technique of stereotaxic convergent-beam irradiation represents a relatively simple, reliable and, in case of precise indication, efficient method for the therapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations

We described in this study the first case of petrousal bone apex chondroblastoma. METHODS: The tumor occurred in a 12-year-old girl and was revealed by left hypoacusis, vertigo, and walking instability. Computerized tomography scan depicted well-demarcated and osteolytic lesion of the left petrousal bone just before the internal acoustic meatus. The tumor was operated on by a subtemporal approach with a subtotal resection. Lesion recurred and was operated a second time by a combined approach subtemporal and translabyrinthine. This treatment was completed by radiotherapy. We used a combination of photon therapy and proton therapy. Outcome was good and free of recurrence 36 months after the second operation. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy can be particularly useful for skull base tumors frequently radioresistant and near very important structures. This case is the first one of a successful treatment by proton therapy for chondroblastoma recurrence	
0	595	Peripheral doses from pediatric IMRT	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	Peripheral dose (PD) data exist for conventional fields (> or = 10 cm) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery to standard adult-sized phantoms. Pediatric peripheral dose reports are limited to conventional therapy and are model based. Our goal was to ascertain whether data acquired from full phantom studies and/or pediatric models, with IMRT treatment times, could predict Organ at Risk (OAR) dose for pediatric IMRT. As monitor units (MUs) are greater for IMRT, it is expected IMRT PD will be higher; potentially compounded by decreased patient size (absorption). Baseline slab phantom peripheral dose measurements were conducted for very small field sizes (from 2 to 10 cm). Data were collected at distances ranging from 5 to 72 cm away from the field edges. Collimation was either with the collimating jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC) oriented either perpendicular or along the peripheral dose measurement plane. For the clinical tests, five patients with intracranial or base of skull lesions were chosen. IMRT and conventional three-dimensional (3D) plans for the same patient/target/dose (180 cGy), were optimized without limitation to the number of fields or wedge use. Six MV, 120-leaf MLC Varian axial beams were used. A phantom mimicking a 3-year-old was configured per Center for Disease Control data. Micro (0.125 cc) and cylindrical (0.6 cc) ionization chambers were appropriated for the thyroid, breast, ovaries, and testes. The PD was recorded by electrometers set to the 10(-10) scale. Each system set was uniquely calibrated. For the slab phantom studies, close peripheral points were found to have a higher dose for low energy and larger field size and when MLC was not deployed. For points more distant from the field edge, the PD was higher for high-energy beams. MLC orientation was found to be inconsequential for the small fields tested. The thyroid dose was lower for IMRT delivery than that predicted for conventional (ratio of IMRT/conventional ranged from 0.47-0.94) doses approximately [0.4-1.8 cGy]/[0.9-2.9 cGy]/fraction, respectively. Prior phantom reports are for fields 10 cm or greater, while pediatric central nervous system fields range from 4 to 7 cm, and effectively much smaller for IMRT (2-6 cm). Peripheral dose in close proximity (< 10 cm from the field edge) is dominated by internal scatter; therefore, field-size differences overwhelm phantom size affects and increased MU. Distant peripheral dose, dominated by head leakage, was higher than predicted, even when accounting for MUs (approximtely factor of 3) likely due to the pediatric phantom size. The ratio of the testes dose ranged from 3.3-5.3 for IMRT/conventional. PD to OAR for pediatric IMRT cannot be predicted from large-field full phantom studies. For regional OAR, doses are likely lower than predicted by existing "large field" data, while the distant PD is higher

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis

The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. METHODS: Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. RESULTS: The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research

This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas and 8 had diffuse choroidal hemangiomas (DCH) and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Of the patients, 19 were treated with photons with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy. A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All patients with DCH but 1 were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of all patients. Tumor thickness decreased in 95.4% and retinal detachment resolved in 92.9%. Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected. In all, 40.9% showed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, maximum Grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity. Retinopathy and radiation-induced optic neuropathy were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely. No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected.

There are several ways to treat prostate cancer by RT. As for external-beam RT (EBRT), a more sophisticated technique beyond 3-dimensional conformal RT called intensity modulated RT was developed and has been in use in many Japanese RT centers. It can raise the total radiation dose and is expected to increase the biochemical control rate. As for brachytherapy, a low-dose-rate seed implant using iodine-125 was initiated in 2003 and has become widespread throughout Japan in only a few years. High-dose-rate brachytherapy using iridium-19 2 has also been used in more advanced cases combined with EBRT. Brachytherapy offers an ideal RT dose concentration and can avoid rectal complications. As for particle therapy, we have carbon and proton in several institutions in Japan. Particles have the merit of good dose distributions and for carbons, relative biological effectiveness. Furthermore, some centers are considering the stereotactic hypofractionated RT due to the relatively low alfa-beta ratio of prostate cancer. Recent reports showed that after a certain period of followup, the biochemical control rate was similar either with external beam high-quality RT, brachytherapy, heavy ion RT and surgery. Therefore, the choice of treatment should depend on the adverse effects, quality of life, medical costs, and the lifestyle of the patient. The merits and demerits of each treatment modality were discussed. Longer follow-up is still necessary and informed consent is mandatory when choosing a treatment modality

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 1998, 142 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with breast conservative surgery and adjuvant RT. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a boost dose of 15 Gy delivered to the tumor bed either by iridium 192, or a combination of photons and electrons. Cosmetic evaluations were done on a 6-month basis, with a final evaluation at 36 months after RT. The evaluations were done using a panel of global and specific subjective scores, a digitized scoring system using the breast retraction assessment (BRA) measurement, and a patient's self-assessment evaluation. As cosmetic results were graded according to severity, the comparison of boost techniques was done using the ordinal logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. RESULTS: At 36 months of follow-up, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the global subjective cosmetic outcome (OR = 1.40; 95%CI = 0.69-2.85, p = 0.35). Good to excellent scores were observed in 65% of implant patients and 62% of photon/electron patients. At 24 months and beyond, telangiectasia was more severe in the implant group with an OR of 9.64 (95%CI = 4.05-22.92, p < 0.0001) at 36 months. The only variable associated with a worse global cosmetic outcome was the presence of concomitant chemotherapy (OR = 3.87; 95%CI = 1.74-8.62). The BRA value once adjusted for age, concomitant chemotherapy, and boost volume showed a positive association with the boost technique. The BRA value was significantly greater in the implant group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the patient's final self-assessment score between the two groups. Three variables were statistically associated with an adverse self-evaluation: an inferior quadrant tumor localization, postoperative hematoma, and concomitant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial showed that at 36 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in the overall global cosmetic scores between the implant boost group and the photon/electron boost group, telangiectasia was more severe and the BRA value was greater in the implant group

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

We sought to determine the value of proton MR spectroscopy in assessing brain tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child's treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: In children with brain tumors, MR spectroscopy of brain tissue remote from the tumor reveals treatment-related biochemical changes

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites	
0	1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

To establish heavy ion therapy for prostate cancer, three trials have been conducted. For 247 patients with T1b-T3 cancer, carbon ion beam was irradiated 20 times/5 weeks with or without endocrine therapy. Overall and cause-specific survivals were excellent and local control was achieved in all patients except one. Grade 3 late morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra was developed in 7 cases who received higher dose. Thus, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment. In conclusion, carbon ion therapy is expected to exert excellent effect in the treatment of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. [References: 19]

This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms.

This assumption was also supported by positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET). In contrast, proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) indicated radiation necrosis, which was confirmed histopathologically in surgical specimens.

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology

This last decade has seen a rapid proliferation in the development of the methodology which is certainly related in part to the simultaneous growth of high-resolution neuro-imaging techniques. By focusing the beams of 201 hemispherically arrayed cobalt 60 sources, the gamma-knife delivers a high dose of radiation to a small target. Another possibility proposed by several authors is the bragg peak cyclotron-generated irradiation with accelerated protons or helium ions. In Lille, since 1988, we have chosen to develop stereotactic radiosurgery, according to the system of Betti, by the association of Talairach's stereotactic methodology and external single-dose encephalic irradiation with high energy X-rays, delivered by means of a linear accelerator. The major indication for the use of this method is an arteriovenous malformation. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be proposed alone or in combination with surgery and embolisation. It has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment and an attractive alternative in carefully selected patients with intracranial tumours: slow-growing, well limited, deep-seated tumours, such as some gliomas, acoustic neurinomas, skull base meningiomas, pituitary adenomas. This treatment is also used to deliver a focal boost of radiation to previously administered fractionated radiotherapy in patients with small gliomas and solitary brain metastases

Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas

The lymphocyte count was reduced to approximately 40 per cent at termination of treatment and remained below the pre-treatment level during a follow-up period of 18 months. The relative spontaneous cytotoxicity for 51Cr-labelled K562 cells, derived from a human myeloid leukemia, increased at completion of irradiation and remained elevated during the entire observation period. The relative cytotoxicity against Chang cells, derived from human liver, also seemed to increase but not to the same extent. The increments were probably due to an increased proportion of spontaneously cytotoxic cells bearing Fc-receptors for IgG which were significantly elevated after treatment. It was concluded that the changes differ from those occurring after local irradiation for breast carcinoma.

A Komai stereotactic ring was used to locate the target coordinates. The patient was laid on the Linac treatment table and held in the head fixation system. Irradiation was given in five positions. The dose profile by film dosimetry and Rando phantom was satisfactory. Seventeen tumors in 14 patients were treated. Clinical or histological diagnoses were nine metastases, one benign and two malignant gliomas, one meningioma, and one craniopharyngioma. Tumor sizes were between 8 and 30 mm. Doses were between 12 and 30 Gy. Computed tomographic evaluation after 3 months of 12 tumors in 11 survivors showed one complete remission, three partial remission, six no change, and two partial deterioration. For progressive tumors, Linac radiosurgery results are excellent

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation	
1	2093	Chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull: a clinicopathologic study of 200 cases with emphasis on its distinction from chordoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Boston, Child, Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Radiation, Recurrence, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival, Survival Rate	Conventional chondrosarcoma (CSA) of the skull base is an uncommon neoplasm that can resemble chordoma, and indeed it is misdiagnosed frequently as such. This has important clinical implications, because when treated with similar aggressive treatment strategies, CSA has a much better prognosis than chordoma. In an effort to identify those morphologic and immunohistochemical features that help to identify conventional skull base CSA correctly and to understand its prognosis better, particularly compared with chordoma, when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, the authors performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 200 CSAs. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 79 years (mean, 39 years), 87 patients were male and 113 patients were female, and most presented with symptoms related to the central nervous system. Approximately 6% of the tumors arose in the sphenoethmoid complex, 28% originated in the clivus, and 66% developed in the temperooccipital junction. Histologically, 15 tumors (7.5%) were classified as hyaline CSA, 59 (29.5%) as myxoid CSA, and 126 (63%) as mixed hyaline and myxoid CSA. A total of 101 (50.5%) tumors were grade 1, 57 (28.5%) had areas of grades 1 and 2, and 42 (21%) were pure grade 2 neoplasms. The vast majority of patients originated from referring hospitals, and the diagnosis was changed prospectively at our institution to CSA from chordoma in 74 patients (37%). Of the tumors studied immunohistochemically, 96 of 97 (98.9%) stained for S-100 protein, 0 of 97 (0%) stained for keratin, and faint staining for epithelial membrane antigen was seen in 7 of 88 tumors (7.95%). All patients underwent high-dose postoperative fractionated precision conformal radiation therapy with a dose that ranged from 64.2 to 79.6 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents (median, 72.1 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents, given in 38 fractions. The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%. In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively. CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy	
1	4729	Results of surgical resection for progression of brain metastases previously treated by gamma knife radiosurgery	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cohort Studies, Disease Progression, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neurosurgical Procedures, Neurosurgical Procedures/ae [Adverse Effects], Patients, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Reoperation, Research, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Universities	OBJECTIVE: To determine treatment outcome after surgical resection for progressive brain metastases after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) and to explore the role of dynamic contrast agent-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton spectroscopic MRI studies (MRS/P) in predicting pathological findings. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 32 patients underwent surgical resection for suspected progression of brain metastases from a cohort of 245 patients with brain metastases treated with GKR. Postradiosurgery MRI surveillance was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after GKR. In some cases, additional MRI scanning with spectroscopy or perfusion (MRS/P) was used to aid differentiation of radiation change from tumor progression. The decision to perform neurosurgical resection was based on MRI or clinical evidence of lesion progression among patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more and absent or stable systemic disease. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (32 out of 245) of patients and 6% (38 out of 611) of lesions required surgical resection after GKR. The median time from GKR to surgical resection was 8.6 months (range, 1.7-27.1 mo). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival from time of GKR was 97, 78, and 47% for the resected patients and 65, 40, and 19% for the nonresected patients (P < 0.0001). The two-year survival rate of patients requiring two resections after GKR was 100% compared with 39% for patients undergoing one resection (P = 0.02). The median survival of resected patients was 27.2 months (range, 7.0-72.5 mo) from the diagnosis of brain metastases, 19.9 months (range, 5.0-60.7 mo) from GKR, and 8.9 months (range, 0.2-53.1 mo) from surgical resection. Tumor was found in 90% of resected specimens and necrosis alone in 10%. MRS/P studies were performed in 15 resected patients. Overall, MRS/P predicted tumor in 11 lesions, confirmed pathologically in nine lesions, and necrosis alone was found in two. The MRS/P predicted necrosis alone in three, whereas pathology revealed viable tumor in two and necrosis in one lesion. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of progressive brain metastases after GKR in selected patients leads to a meaningful improvement in survival rates. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MRS/P in the postradiosurgery surveillance of brain metastases	
0	675	Proton beam radiotherapy versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: A comparative study	Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Germany, Humans, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study was undertaken between proton and photon therapy in uveal melanoma to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. A fixed proton horizontal beam (OPTIS) and intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT), with multiple noncoplanar beam arrangements, was compared with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), using a static and a dynamic micromultileaf collimator and intensity-modulated RT (IMRS). METHOD AND MATERIALS: A planning CT scan was performed on a brain metastasis patient, with a 3-mm acquisition slice spacing and the patient looking at a luminous spot with the eyes in three different positions (neutral and 25 degrees right and left). Four different gross tumor volumes were defined for each treatment technique. These target scenarios represented different locations (involving vs. not involving the macula and temporal vs. nasal) and volumes (10 x 6 mm vs. 16 x 10 mm) to challenge the proton and photon treatment techniques. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 2 mm laterally and 3 mm craniocaudally for both modalities. A dose homogeneity of 95-99% of the planning target volume was used as the "goal" for all techniques. The dose constraint (maximum) for the organs at risk (OARs) for both the proton and the SRT photon plans was 27.5, 22.5, 20, and 9 CGE-Gy for the optic apparatus, retina, lacrimal gland, and lens, respectively. The dose to the planning target volume was 50 CGE-Gy in 10 CGE-Gy daily fractions. The plans for proton and photon therapy were computed using the Paul Scherrer Institute and BrainSCAN, version 5.2 (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) treatment planning systems, respectively. Tumor and OARs dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using the dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index (CI(95%)), and inhomogeneity coefficient. RESULTS: Target coverage of all simulated uveal melanomas was equally conformal with the photon and proton modalities. The median CI(95%) value was 1.74, 1.86, and 1.83 for the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively. With proton planning, the median CI(95%) was 1.88 for OPTIS and substantially improved with IMPT in some tumor cases (median CI(95%), 1.29). The tumor dose homogeneity in the proton plans was, however, always better than with SRT photon planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient 0.1 and 0.15 vs. 0.46, 0.41, and 0.23 for the OPTIS and IMPT vs. the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively). Compared with the photon plans, the use of protons did not lead to a substantial reduction in the homolateral OAR total integral dose in the low- to high-dose level, except for the lacrimal gland. The median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume with the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans was 33-30.8, 31.8-28, and 35.8-49 Gy, respectively, for the lacrimal gland, a critical organ. For protons, only the OPTIS plans were better, with a median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume using OPTIS and IMPT of 19.2 and 8.8 and 25.6 and 23.6 CGE, respectively. The contralateral OARs were completely spared with the proton plans, but the median dose delivered to these structures was 1.2 Gy (range, 0-6.3 Gy) with the SRT photon plans. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of SRT photon techniques, compared with protons, can result in similar levels of dose conformation. IMPT did not increase the degree of conformality for this small tumor. Tumor dose inhomogeneity was, however, always increased with photon planning. Except for the lacrimal gland, the use of protons, with or without intensity modulation, did not increase homolateral OAR dose sparing. The dose to all the contralateral OARs was, however, completely eliminated with proton planning

The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%.

CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management	
1	3650	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: local recurrence after proton beam therapy	Adult, Boston, Cobalt, Eye, Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty-three of 1006 (2.3%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986 received additional treatment for documented (15 patients) or suspected (eight patients) tumor growth in the irradiated eye. Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes

METHODS: The authors review the current status of advanced technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. RESULTS: Advances in radiotherapy have resulted in improved treatment for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses modifications in the intensity of the photon-beam from a linear accelerator across the irradiated fields to enhance dose conformation in three dimensions. For proton-beam radiation therapy, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are accelerated in cyclotrons or synchrotrons, extracted, and transported to treatment rooms where the proton beam undergoes a series of modifications that conform the dose in a particular patient to the tumor target. Brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy have generally been used to treat microscopic residual disease in patients with sarcomas. These technologies deliver dose to tumor cells with irradiation of limited volumes of normal tissue. Patients who may benefit from technically advanced radiotherapy include those with skull base and spine/paraspinal sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and retroperitoneal/extremity sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in radiation therapy technology, particularly IMRT, proton-beam or other charged-particle radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and intraoperative radiation therapy, have led to improved treatment for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

The tumor areas were irradiated by fast electrons or cobalt 60 with 50 to 55 Gy, the lymph nodes received doses of 45 to 55 Gy. Local tumor control was achieved in 27 out of 28 patients irradiated immediately after surgery (96%). In case of demonstrated lymph node invasion, local control was achieved in 14 out of 19 cases (74%). The median survival was 9.6 years for patients in stage T1/2, N0, M0 and 2.5 years for patients in stage T1-4, N+, M0. The first two years following to therapy were decisive for the prognosis. Among those of our patients who developed recurrences during this period, not one could be cured in the long run. Two years after the end of therapy, the survival probability of patients without lymph node metastases becomes comparable to the survival curve of normal male population of the same age. In the treatment of penile carcinoma, a gradual proceeding depending on the stage is recommended for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. In case of lymph node metastases, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy should be taken into consideration

The aim was to provide maximal local tumor control while minimizing complications such as cranial nerve injuries. METHODS: Thirty-one acoustic neuromas in 30 patients were treated with proton beam therapy from March 1991 to June 1999. The mean tumor volume was 4.3 cm(3). All patients underwent pretreatment neurological evaluation, contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and audiometric evaluation. Standard fractionated proton radiotherapy was used at daily doses of 1.8 to 2.0 cobalt Gray equivalent: patients with useful hearing before treatment (Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II) received 54.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 fractions; patients without useful hearing received 60.0 cobalt Gray equivalent in 30 to 33 fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 30 patients were assessable for tumor control and cranial nerve injury. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 98 months (mean, 34 mo), during which no patients demonstrated disease progression on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Eleven patients demonstrated radiographic regression. Of the 13 patients with pretreatment Gardner-Robertson Grade I or II hearing, 4 (31%) maintained useful hearing. No transient or permanent treatment-related trigeminal or facial nerve dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSION: Fractionated proton beam therapy provided excellent local control of acoustic neuromas when treatment was administered in moderate doses. No injuries to the Vth or VIIth cranial nerves were observed. A reduction in the tumor dose is being evaluated to increase the hearing preservation rate

We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments

All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma. Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation. The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with meningioma of the skull base or spine were irradiated with helium charged particle radiotherapy at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (UCLBL) during the period 1981-1992. Twenty-six patients were treated for intracranial and three for spinal tumors. Total doses of 53.0-80.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) with a mean of 63 GyE were delivered using the helium ion beam. RESULTS: Ten-year local control and survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method were 84% and 80% respectively. Doses of 60.0 GyE were delivered with a low rate of complications. The only failures were in massive, recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: High doses using helium charged particle radiotherapy can be safely and effectively delivered to large residual or unresectable meningioma near radiosensitive structures

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method	
0	1223	Stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and inverse treatment planning for advanced pleural mesothelioma. Feasibility and initial results	Aged, Feasibility Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Mesothelioma/mo [Mortality], Mesothelioma/ra [Radiography], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Pleural Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pleural Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pleural Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiography,Thoracic, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Software, Survival, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complex-shaped malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) with challenging volumes are extremely difficult to treat by conventional radiotherapy due to tolerance doses of the surrounding normal tissue. In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

Protocols were largely nonrandomized. Some results have been obtained: 1) results with mixed beam studies for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix have been equivocal compared with the photon controls. 2) some trends of local control have been observed in the trial of esophageal cancer, early cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung and malignant melanoma. 3) significant better results were observed in the pancoast type lung cancer and osteo sarcoma which was treated by the systemic multimodal treatment. It is concluded that neutrons are efficacious for certain specific tumor types owing to some biological effects, however the problem of inferior dose distribution was the weakness of neutron therapy at present.

Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHODS: MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a "spreading wavefront" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service

Three of these patients had refused to take corticosteroids and the other 11 had failed to respond to them, had experienced side effects, or had other contraindications to their use. After follow-up periods ranging from six months to three years, soft-tissue inflammation was reduced in 13 of the 14 patients. All but two patients showed a decrease in proptosis of 1 to 3 mm.

Basing on the measurement of the prostate in 3 directions in patients with different stages of disease (T1-2-24, T3-29 and T4-20), a conclusion was made that a prostate size was not enough to determine a stage of disease though a tendency to an increase in prostate size corresponded to the growing T index. However, stages T1-2 and T4 could be determined for sure within a certain range of prostate size values

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

0	2812	[Suppression of testicular testosterone production by irradiation of the testis in prostatic cancer]. [German]	Aged, Electrons, Humans, Male, Neoplasms,Hormone-Dependent/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Testis, Testosterone/bl [Blood]	Irradiation of the tests of 11 patients with carcinoma of the prostate in the age from 68 to 78 years with 20 Gy (5 X 2 Gy per week) decreased the plasma testosterone levels to an average of 70,3% of the initial values. After operative orchidectomy, however, a decrease of the plasma testosterone level to only 5% the values before operation was observed. Therefore, the operative orchidectomy cannot be replaced by the irradiation of the testes. Higher irradiation doses may cause skin injuries and there is the possibility of being a real carcinogen noxe for the irradiation region too

Individual proton spectra from the 3-D array of spectra encompassing the lesion showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation necrosis, recurrent or residual tumor, or normal brain. The 1H-MRS imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or recurrent tumor and contrast-enhancing radiation-induced necrosis. Regions of abnormally high choline (Cho) levels, consistent with viable tumor, were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 gliomas. Changes in the serial 1H-MRS imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following treatment. These changes included the significant reduction in Cho levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to necrotic tissue. For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical progression, an increase in Cho levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or necrotic. Several patients showed regional variations in response to brachytherapy as evaluated by 1H-MRS imaging. This study demonstrates the potential of noninvasive 3-D 1H-MRS imaging to discriminate between the formation of contrast-enhancing radiation necrosis and residual or recurrent tumor following brachytherapy. This modality may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to brachytherapy by detecting the presence of abnormnal metabolite levels in nonenhancing regions of solid tumor

DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

No patient demonstrated tumor enlargement, and most lesions followed for more than five months have demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Heavy charged particle irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity associated with it in either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

A high alpha 1-antitrypsin level and a normal alpha 2-macroglobulin level were found in all the breast cancer patients. An increase in both blood serum inhibitors was detected in hypophyseal adenoma. The dependence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin content on a subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spread was revealed in the course of 2 years following "hypophysectomy" in the patients with disseminated breast cancer. In the hypophyseal adenoma patients the activity of both inhibitors returned to normal 1 year after treatment and remained within normal during 3 years of follow-up. It was regarded as a positive therapeutic effect. The above findings make it possible to propose the determination of the activity af alpha 1-antitrypsin in breast cancer and alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in hypophyseal adenoma as an additional test for the evaluation of the results of proton "hypophysectomy"	
1	601	The potential of proton beam radiation therapy in gastrointestinal cancer	Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Incidence, Knowledge, Models,Biological, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sweden, Uncertainty	A group of Swedish oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. In gastrointestinal cancers, it is assessed that at least 345 patients, mainly non-resectable rectal cancers, oesophageal and liver cancers, are eligible. Great uncertainties do however exist both in the number of patients with gastrointestinal cancers suitable for radiation therapy, and in the proportion of those where proton beams may give sufficiently better results

Twenty-one of the 28 patients (75%) achieved at least a partial local response. There were 9 patients (32%) who achieved a complete response and 12 patients (43%) who achieved a partial response. The responses were 9/11 for squamous cell carcinoma, 5/10 for adenocarcinoma, 5/5 for large cell carcinoma, and 2/2 for small cell carcinoma patients. Treatment was very well tolerated and in fact, no acute radiation related complications were observed during the 10-12 week treatment duration. Radiation induced fibrosis of various degrees has occurred but it has been mostly asymptomatic and similar to what is normally seen using conventional continuous schedules. In this group of very advanced lung cancer patients, failures have mostly resulted from metastatic progression; only one patient progressed locally in the irradiated field without evidence of metastatic disease. A preliminary analysis indicates that this treatment yields results that are similar to those achieved with conventional fractionation regimens and should be explored further

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients	
0	1215	Near simultaneous computed tomography image-guided stereotactic spinal radiotherapy: an emerging paradigm for achieving true stereotaxy	Equipment Design, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Immobilization, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Respiration, Rotation, Spinal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stereotaxic Techniques, Supine Position, Texas, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Vacuum	PURPOSE: To report treatment setup data from an emerging technique using near-simultaneous computed tomography (CT) image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of spinal and paraspinal tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A targeting system that integrates a CT-on-rails scanner with a linear accelerator (LINAC) was evaluated in the lead-in portion of a Phase I/II protocol for treating patients with paraspinal metastases. Patients were immobilized in supine position by a moldable body cushion vacuum wrapped with a plastic fixation sheet. Planning CT and immediately repeated CT were performed on the LINAC/CT-on-rails unit to assess respiratory-related vertebral body motion. Coplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using 7-9 beams was used to deliver 30 Gy in five fractions to the target volume, while limiting the spinal cord dose to <10 Gy. Pretreatment CT scans were fused with the planning CT scans to determine the correct target isocenter by accounting for any translational and roll (axial) rotational discrepancies from the planning CT. (Corrections caused by yaw and pitch rotations have not yet been implemented.) The reproducibility of the treatment isocenter as compared with the planned isocenter was measured with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), portal film imaging, and immediate post-treatment verification CT scans. Phantom measurements were taken for dose verification for each IMRT plan. RESULTS: Based on a total of 36 CT scans (3 for planning, 3 for respiration study, 15 pretreatment, and 15 post-treatment) from 3 patients, no respiration-associated vertebral body motion was seen. A comparison of the corrected daily anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) digital portal images with the planning AP and LAT DRRs confirmed that the isocenter setup accuracy for the 15 treatments was within 1 mm of the planning isocenter. The results from the immediate post-treatment CT scans reconfirmed the findings from the portal images and verified the absence of spinal movement during the treatment. The ion-chamber measurement for the high-dose region was within 2% of the planning dose for three patient treatment plans. Film dose measurement in an IMRT quality assurance phantom demonstrated good agreement from 90% to 30% isodose lines between the planned and measured results. CONCLUSION: Preliminary experience suggests that the near-simultaneous CT image-guided verification technique can be used as a new platform technology for extracranial applications of stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery to spinal and paraspinal tumors	
0	285	Clinical feasibility of using an EPID in CINE mode for image-guided verification of stereotactic body radiotherapy	Dose Fractionation, Feasibility Studies, Gold, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Movement, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Prostheses and Implants, Radiotherapy, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Stereotaxic Techniques/st [Standards], Technology,Radiologic/is [Instrumentation], Technology,Radiologic/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: To introduce a novel method for monitoring tumor location during stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) while the treatment beam is on by using a conventional electronic portal imaging device (EPID). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1989 through July 2000, 225 patients with HCC underwent their first course of proton beam therapy at the University of Tsukuba. Of them, 27 with 68 lesions who had undergone two or more courses were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Median interval between the first and second course was 24.5 months (range 3.3-79.8 months). Median total dose of 72 Gy in 16 fractions and 66 Gy in 16 fractions were given for the first course and the rest of the courses, respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate and median survival period from the beginning of the first course for the 27 patients were 55.6% and 62.2 months, respectively. Five-year local control rate for the 68 lesions was 87.8%. Of the patients, 1 with Child-Pugh class B and another with class C before the last course suffered from acute hepatic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated proton beam therapy for HCC is safe when the patient has a target in the peripheral region of the liver and liver function is Child-Pugh class A

0	1266	Clinical dosimetry with MOSFET dosimeters to determine the dose along the field junction in a split beam technique	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Calibration, Humans, Lead, Netherlands, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Quality Control, Radiation Dosage, Radiometry/is [Instrumentation]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report on the accuracy of metal oxide-silicon semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors to measure dose distributions in the region of a field junction in a split beam technique, compared to ionisation chamber and photographic film. We present a study on five patients receiving loco-regional treatment for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose variation at the junction was measured with the patient dose verification system model TN-RD-50 (MOSFET system). Phantom measurements were performed to investigate the MOSFET accuracy in a half-field matching method and the influence of factors related to the accelerator. The aim of the patient measurements was to determine the effect of patient related factors on the dose at the junction over a period of 10 irradiation fractions. RESULTS: The MOSFET detector overestimates the dose in the junction area, therefore a correction factor was determined to correct the MOSFET results. Phantom measurements showed overdosages as well as underdosages, depending on the matching field direction (X or Y). Patient measurements showed dose values that deviated up to 133%+/-3% (2 S.D.). The average values of 10 irradiation sessions showed a continuous, almost linear, variation of dose value across the junction. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Significant dose deviations in the junction area average out over repeated treatments; (2) one individual measurement in the junction area should not lead to any action; (3) a linac QA procedure to check the dose at the junction line should simulate the clinical situation sufficiently; and (4) MOSFET dosimeters overestimate dose values in the penumbra region

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer received accelerated photon and proton radiation, 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions/5.5 weeks, to the primary disease, involved lymph nodes, and potential areas of subclinical spread. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial control for local disease was 88%, and for neck node disease, 96%; yielding a 84% locoregional control rate at 5 years. Four patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 84%. The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival rate was 81%; at 5 years, it was 65%. All patients completed the prescribed treatment; though aggressive nutritional and anesthetic support was necessary. Late Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Protons used as a concomitant boost with photons effectively delivered an accelerated time-dose schedule to the cancer with a more tolerable schedule to surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary results reveal increased locoregional control without increased toxicity. Future studies must evaluate the optimum time-dose schedule

[French]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Prevalence, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Reproduction, Retrospective Studies	To evaluate irradiation effects on choroidal melanomas, histopathologic findings of 18 eyes whose primary treatment was enucleation were compared to 15 eyes enucleated after proton beam irradiation. Irradiated tumors showed more likely necrosis (p = 0.01) had balloon cells (p = 0.01), and inflammatory infiltrate (p = 0.05). In the irradiated group, the prevalence of tumor blood vessel damage was higher (p = 0.0002) and mitotic figures were fewer (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that proton beam irradiation damages tumor cells and alters the tumor's capacity for cellular reproduction. It damages blood vessels leading to tumor necrosis. It induces an inflammatory response of unknown effects. Radiosensitivity of choroidal melanomas cannot be assessed using conventional histologic methods. However, tumor necrosis, mitotic activity and rate of balloon cells can help to establish tumoral sensitivity to irradiation

No patient demonstrated tumor enlargement, and most lesions followed for more than five months have demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Heavy charged particle irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity associated with it in either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury

Two phase I/II clinical studies on the carbon beam radiation treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were carried out in our institution from October 1996 to February 1999. The dose-limiting toxicity was found to be radiation pneumonia. In the first protocol, 47 patients received 18 fractions of increasing doses from 59.4 GyE by 10% over 6 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was found to be 95.4 GyE, while the complete tumor control dose was 85.6 GyE. In the second protocol, 34 patients received 9 fractions of in creasing doses from 68.4 GyE by 5% over 3 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was 79.2 GyE, and the complete tumor control dose was > 68.9 GyE. The 4-year survival rate estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 56% for patients receiving the first protocol. Because a higher local control rate was achieved in the second protocol, the 5-year survival rate is estimated to be higher and similar to that achieved after surgery. Another phase II clinical study in patients with stage INSCLC is ongoing. Heavy-particle radiotherapy is a new modality for the treatment of lung cancer which holds promise for the 21st century.

The melanomas measured 7 to 15 mm at the tumor base and 2 t0 5 mm thick. First, photocoagulation using the green argon laser was aimed at closing the choroidal vascular supply of the tumor. In a second stage, tumor tissue was destroyed using the red krypton laser for confluent burns of long duration. Such treatment was supplemented by cryotherapy in peripherally located tumors or whenever photocoagulation alone did not result in tumor regression. Photocoagulation alone was used in ten eyes and combined wih cryotherapy in seven. After an average follow-up of 42 months, marked tumor regression was achieved in 12 eyes and some tumor regression in two. Tow eyes ultimately required proton beam irradiation, and one eye was enucleated. No metastasis occurred during follow-up

DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and December 2001, 74 patients were treated for chordomas and chondrosarcomas with carbon ion RT at the "Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung" (GSI). Seven patients reirradiated with reduced carbon ion doses after conventional RT were excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 evaluable patients (44 chordomas and 23 chondrosarcomas) who received a full course of carbon ion therapy. Tumor-conform application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with active energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included intensity modulation and biological plan optimization. A median dose of 60 GyE was applied to the target volume within 20 consecutive days at a dose of 3.0 GyE per fraction. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-46 months). At 3 years, actuarial local control was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 87% for chordomas, respectively. Partial tumor remission was observed in 14/44 (31%) chordoma patients and in 4/23 (17%) chondrosarcoma patients. At 3 years, actuarial overall survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 89% for chordomas, respectively. No severe side effects > CTC degrees III have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the clinical efficiency and safety of scanning beam delivery of carbon ion beams in patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. The observation of tumor regressions at a dose level of 60 GyE may indicate that the biological effectiveness of carbon ions in chordomas and chondrosarcomas is higher than initially estimated

Patients with locally advanced cancer frequently are included in clinical trials that examine treatment for patients at high risk for relapse based on presenting prostate-specific antigen, high Gleason score, or advanced clinical stage. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that men with localized prostate cancer benefit from high-dose radiation therapy delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or proton beam therapy. Most importantly, neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy have significantly improved outcomes in men with locally advanced or high-risk prostate cancer. Although questions remain regarding the optimal timing and duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy, a combination of long-term androgen deprivation started before radiation therapy and continued for 2 years represents a North American standard of care for this patient population.

In all cases the diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory data, as well as radiographic images. Ten patients with false-negative CT scans had MRI confirming the presence of microadenomas less than 5 mm in size. The majority of patients (n = 51) were operated via transsphenoidal approach, transcranial route was utilized in 2 cases. Among the pathological findings, corticotropinomas were revealed in 49 cases, 4 patients were considered to have hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary without well demarcated adenoma. All patients were divided into 2 groups based on the history of previous treatment. Group 1 included 37 primary patients who had not been treated before admission. Group 2 included 16 patients treated surgically (e.g. neurosurgical operations, bilateral/unilateral adrenalectomy), or with irradiation therapy, including proton beam irradiation prior to admission. We came to conclusion that the following principles were essential in the management of Cushing's disease. 1. Properly interpreted clinical signs and symptoms along with biochemical data and radiographic imaging (including MRI) are extremely helpful in the preoperative evaluation of such patients. Our approach helped us reveal corticotropinomas with 98% accuracy. 2. Microsurgical removal was proved to be effective in up to 83% of patients, which was demonstrated by clinical and biochemical remission. 3. It should be emphasized that the results of treatment were significantly better in the first group versus the second one. In group 1, remission was reached in 91.1% of patients as compared to 62.5% in Group 2. 4. In primary patients, the trauma associated with surgical procedure is less and tumors demonstrate a less aggressive biological behavior

In published series it has been demonstrated that the external boost can be replaced by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) where irradiation at a single dose from 10 up to 15 Gy was safely delivered directly to the tumor bed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, we initiated a dose escalation study to investigate the feasibility of applying single doses of IORT from 10 Gy up to 22 Gy. A portable IORT equipment with different electron energies was used. From July to December 1999, a total of 65 patients with T1-2 (max. 2.5 cm) No-1 breast cancer, median age 58 years (range 33-80 years) was treated. Ten patients received 10 Gy, eight patients were treated with an IORT of 15 Gy, eight received 17 Gy, six had 19 Gy, and 33 were treated with 21-22 Gy. Patients with 10 and 15 Gy received an additional EBRT of 44 and 40 Gy, respectively. In all other patients IORT was the sole radiation treatment. RESULTS: No acute side effects or intermediate untoward effects after a follow-up from three to nine months related to IORT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Since the applicator can be safely placed under the control of the surgeon and radiotherapist IORT has the potential of accurately treating the tumor bed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis. With IORT single doses of 22 Gy being equivalent to a 60 Gy EBRT can safely be delivered. Even so the average time of operation was prolonged by around 20 minutes IORT application ultimately improves the quality of life of the patients in shortening overall treatment. Long-term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate whether large single doses of IORT might have the potential of sufficient local tumor control without major side effects. As a future perspective a randomized trial comparing EBRT with IORT as sole treatment will be performed

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity	
0	361	Prostate and lymph node proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging with external array coils at 3 T to detect recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy	Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Biopsy, Choline/me [Metabolism], Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Informed Consent, Lymph Node Excision, Lymphatic Metastasis/pa [Pathology], Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/mt [Methods], Male, Neoplasm Staging, Netherlands, Prostatic Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, Water	In a patient suspected of having recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy, we demonstrate the feasibility of noninvasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (1H-MRS) imaging of the prostate and a lymph node at 3 T using a matrix of external surface coils. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. With 1H-MRS imaging, high choline with low citrate signal was observed in the prostate, and in the lymph node a signal of choline-containing compounds was identified. The tissue level of the compounds in the enlarged lymph node was estimated to be 8.1 mmol/kg water. Subsequent histopathological analysis of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and computed tomography-guided biopsy of the lymph node confirmed the presence of prostate cancer in both

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect	
0	4492	Macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation. 10-year follow-up observation with histopathologic correlation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/pa [Pathology], Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Risk, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Although patients with choroidal melanoma within 3 mm of both the optic nerve and fovea are at higher risk for visual loss after proton beam irradiation, half of the patients in this study with visual acuity better than 20/200 before treatment maintained this level of vision for at least 2 years. Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation

Technical considerations and results	Aged, Ascites/et [Etiology], Ascites/pc [Prevention & Control], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence/pc [Prevention & Control], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To present technical considerations and results of proton irradiation in a single fraction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with uncontrollable ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation	
0	936	Time course of serum cytokines in patients receiving proton or combined photon/proton beam radiation for resectable but medically inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer	Adenocarcinoma/bl [Blood], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Biological Markers, Biological Markers/bl [Blood], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/bl [Blood], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/bl [Blood], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Collagen Type III/bl [Blood], Female, Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/bl [Blood], Fibrosis, Humans, Incidence, Interleukins/bl [Blood], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Pneumonitis/bl [Blood], Radiotherapy, Research, Time, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/an [Analysis]	PURPOSE: We prospectively measured the levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and procollagen III peptide (P III P) in serum from non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with photons combined with protons or protons alone. These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome	
0	1029	Quantification of volumetric and geometric changes occurring during fractionated radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer using an integrated CT/linear accelerator system	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/dt [Drug Therapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Head and Neck Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Middle Aged, Parotid Gland/pa [Pathology], Parotid Gland/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Pilot Projects, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Texas, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Weight Loss	PURPOSE: Many patients receiving fractionated radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer have marked anatomic changes during their course of treatment, including shrinking of the primary tumor or nodal masses, resolving postoperative changes/edema, and changes in overall body habitus/weight loss. We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan

A combined CP/CPMG multi-echo, multislice sequence was used to measure T1 and T2 in each pixel with an uncertainty not exceeding 10%. In a prospective clinical study, 12 patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors were investigated. For each ROI in the calculated T1 and T2 parameter images, texture parameters originating from the grey level distribution, the gradient distribution, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the grey level runlength histogram were used for classification and discrimination between tissues. All regions corresponding to the normal brain tissue (white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid) were successfully discriminated from each other as well as from the pathological tissue parts (edema and tumor). The classification of 10 edematous and 8 tumorous tissue regions yielded only one misclassification. Together with additional rules, these discrimination rules formed the knowledge base of an expert system for segmentation of the brain images. In cases of tumors without Gd-DTPA contrast medium uptake or in cases of Gd-DTPA contraindication, segmentated images can help solve nontrivial diagnostical problems such as delineating the target volume in radiation therapy

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients

Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

1	2026	Respiratory gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy	Carbon, Diaphragm, Fluoroscopy, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Light, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Motion, Movement, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	PURPOSE: In order to reduce the treatment margin of the moving target due to breathing, we developed a gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The motion of a patient due to respiration is detected by the motion of the body surface around the chest wall. A respiratory sensor was developed using an infrared light spot and a position-sensitive detector. A timing signal to request a beam is generated in response to the respiration waveform, and a carbon beam is extracted from the synchrotron using a RF-knockout method. CT images for treatment planning are taken in synchronization with the respiratory motion. For patient positioning, digitized fluoroscopic images superimposed with the respiration waveform were used. The relation between the respiratory sensor signal and the organ motion was examined using digitized video images from fluoroscopy. The performance of our gated system was demonstrated by using the moving phantom, and dose profiles were measured in the direction of phantom motion. RESULTS: The timing of gate-on is set at the end of the expiratory phase, because the motion of the diaphragm is slower and more reproducible than during the inspiratory phase. The signal of the respiratory sensor shows a phase difference of 120 milliseconds between lower and upper locations on the chest wall. The motion of diaphragm is delayed by 200 milliseconds from the respiration waveform at the lower location. The beam extraction system worked according to the beam on/off logic for gating, and the gated CT scanner performed well. The lateral penumbra size of the dose profile along the moving axis was distinguishably decreased by the gated irradiation. The ratio of the nongated to gated lateral fall-off was 4.3, 3.5, and 2. 0 under the stroke of 40.0, 29.0, and 13.0 mm respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed a total treatment system of gated irradiation for heavy-ion radiotherapy. We found that with this system the target margin along the body axis could be decreased to 5-10 mm although the target moved twice or three times. Over 150 patients with lung or liver cancer had already been treated by this gated irradiation system by the end of July 1999

[French]	Cataract/et [Etiology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye Enucleation, Glaucoma,Neovascular/di [Diagnosis], Glaucoma,Neovascular/su [Surgery], Glaucoma,Neovascular/et [Etiology], Humans, Intraocular Pressure, Lead, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Ocular Hypertension/et [Etiology], Pain, Pressure, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Vision	A 52-year-old-male patient was treated for a posterior choroid melanoma of the right eye. When it was diagnosed, it measured 6mm in thickness and 11.9mm for the largest diameter and had a typical mushroom shape. General investigations found no metastatic disease. It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment. Neovascular glaucoma is a major complication that very often leads to enucleation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions. RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an alpha/beta value of 3.7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated. CONCLUSION: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas	
0	1880	Intraocular melanoma spread to regional lymph nodes: report of two cases	Adult, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Humans, Lymph Node Excision, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Lymph Nodes/su [Surgery], Lymphatic Metastasis, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Neck, Research, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: To report two cases of regional lymphatic spread of primary uveal melanoma. METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics	
1	556	Accelerated partial-breast irradiation using proton beams: initial clinical experience	Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/px [Psychology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Breast/pa [Pathology], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Esthetics, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Massachusetts, Mastectomy,Segmental, Middle Aged, Patient Satisfaction, Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Telangiectasis/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: We present our initial clinical experience with proton, three-dimensional, conformal, external beam, partial-breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance	
1	3550	Proton therapy for pediatric cranial tumors: preliminary report on treatment and disease-related morbidities	Adolescent, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/co [Complications], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Medical Records, Methods, Morbidity, Physical Examination, Pituitary Neoplasms/co [Complications], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Seizures/et [Etiology], Universities	PURPOSE: Accelerated protons were used in an attempt to limit treatment-related morbidity in children with tumors in or near the developing brain, by reducing the integral dose to adjacent normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children treated with protons at Loma Linda University Medical Center between August 1991 and December 1994 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight children, aged 1 to 18 years, were identified as at risk for brain injury from treatment. Medical records, physical examinations, and correspondence with patients, their parents, and referring physicians were analyzed. The investigators tabulated post-treatment changes in pre-treatment signs and symptoms and made judgments as to whether improvement, no change, or worsening related to disease or treatment had supervened. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with clinical findings and radiographic impressions were tabulated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 7 to 49 months (median 25 months). Four instances of treatment-related morbidity were identified. Forty-one instances of site-specific, disease-related morbidity were identified: 15 improved or resolved and 26 remained unchanged after treatment. Four patients had radiographic evidence of local failure. Three of these patients, including two with high-grade glioma, have died. CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related morbidity associated with proton therapy is low. Tumor progression remains a problem when treating certain histologies such as high-grade glioma. Escalating the dose delivered to target volumes may benefit children with tumors associated with poor rates of local control. Long-term follow-up, including neurocognitive testing, is in progress to assess integral-dose effects on cognitive, behavioral and developmental outcomes in children with cranial tumors	
1	380	Survival after primary enucleation for choroidal melanoma: changes induced by the introduction of conservative therapies	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Eye Enucleation/mo [Mortality], Female, Humans, Knowledge, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: Most uveal melanomas are currently treated by eye-preserving radiotherapies. However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling	
0	2360	Base of skull and cervical spine chordomas in children treated by high-dose irradiation	Adolescent, Adult, Boston, Cervical Vertebrae, Child, Child,Preschool, Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Fibrosis, Humans, Incidence, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Morbidity, Necrosis, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Temporal Lobe	PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of children with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas treated by high dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity	
0	2833	Sympathetic ophthalmia complicating helium ion irradiation of a choroidal melanoma	Aged, California, Californium, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Fundus Oculi, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Inflammation, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Ophthalmia,Sympathetic/et [Etiology], Ophthalmia,Sympathetic/pa [Pathology], Radiation Injuries/co [Complications], Tantalum, Universities, Vision	Sympathetic ophthalmia was diagnosed 49 months after helium ion irradiation of a left choroidal melanoma. The patient maintained good vision until 18 months after therapy, when she developed neovascular glaucoma. This complication required multiple therapeutic procedures, including topical anti-inflammatory and antiglaucomatous drops, 360 degrees peripheral panretinal cryoblation, and a single 180 degrees application of inferior cyclocryotherapy over a 2 1/2-year period. Four weeks after the cyclocryotherapy, inflammation was noted in both eyes, and, one month later, enucleation of the left sympathogenic eye was performed. Serial histopathologic sections showed a full-thickness, fibrovascular, scleral scar and tantalum marker ring suture without uveal incarceration. Penetrating surgical trauma, a uveal melanoma, and multiple nonpenetrating treatments resulted in the development of sympathetic ophthalmia	
1	3899	The influence of computer tomography on treatment strategies and follow-up in tumors of the nasopharynx and the paranasal sinuses. A retrospective study on 104 patients	Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Methods, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Retreatment, Retrospective Studies, Skull, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	BACKGROUND: The high value of computer tomography (CT) for detailed imaging of nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinus tumors is known. Less known is the influence of such diagnostic findings on decisions of the therapist. An analysis of this influence might help to compare the value of CT and MRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 104 treated patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx (n = 54) and the paranasal sinuses (n = 50). The study analyzed the influence of CT on primary tumor diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment decision, therapy planning, detection and time of recurrences and retreatment of relapses. RESULTS: Tumors of the nasopharynx: The value of CT for tumor staging was 76% but there was no influence on treatment decision. Radiotherapy planning was influenced in 37% of cases. CT for follow-up was done in 22% of cases. Most relapses occurred within the first 2 years. Paranasal sinus tumors: There was no influence of CT on primary diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor staging was influenced by CT in 94%, treatment decision in 44% and radiotherapy planning in 60%. CT control immediately after therapy was of value in 40%. Most relapses were found within 3 years but some in the 4th and 5th year. Some patients survived 3 to 9 years after retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In tumors of the nasopharynx there is less influence of CT on therapy strategies than diagnostic radiologists might think. No CT is needed for treatment decision since radiotherapy is the only choice of treatment. CT influenced radiotherapy planning however, in about 1/3 of our cases answering sufficiently the 2 main questions: tumor spread into the anterior half of the facial skull or involvement of the base of skull. The retreatment of recurrences detected by CT showed poor results. Late recurrences seem to have better prognosis. We recommend therefore routinely 1 basic CT 6 months after primary treatment followed by 1 CT yearly from the 3rd to 5th year. MRT might offer more diagnostic details than CT. However, at present therapy is not influenced much by this. Since CT is cheaper and faster, MRT could be discussed as additional procedure when CT presents equivocal findings and this fact could be decisive for therapy planning. Paranasal sinus tumors: The influence of CT on tumor-staging and treatment decision is high and convincing. CT helps also at radiotherapy planning and control of tumor response after therapy. CT has high value in detecting recurrences. Retreatment could control disease in some of our patients for 3 to 9 years. Better results could be achieved possibly with earlier diagnosis of recurrence. We propose therefore a basic-CT 6 months after first treatment and 1 CT routinely from the 2nd to 5th year. From the therapist's point of view we recommend CT as first imaging procedure in sinonasal tumors. MRT, more time- and cost consuming, should be applied when CT is equivocal and treatment decision could be influenced	
1	2921	Cataract extraction after proton beam irradiation for malignant melanoma of the eye.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Cataract Extraction, Cataract/pp [Physiopathology], Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Postoperative Complications, Risk, Risk Factors, Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	We evaluated visual outcome and risk of metastases in patients who underwent cataract extraction after protonbeam irradiation of a uveal melanoma. A total of 84 patients underwent cataract extraction between 2 months and 11 years after irradiation. One year after cataract extraction, approximately half of the patients had visual acuity of 20/100 or better, and approximately one third had an acuity of 20/40 or better. Larger tumor size was highly correlated with poor visual outcome 1 year after extraction. Six patients underwent enucleation after cataract removal, five due to blind, painful eyes and one due to continued growth of a previously undiagnosed ring melanoma. The rate of metastases was not higher among patients who underwent cataract extraction (adjusted rate ratio, 0.83). Results suggest that cataract extraction offers improvement of vision in selected eyes previously irradiated for a uveal melanoma, without adding to the risk of metastases among patients undergoing the procedure

[German]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroidal Neovascularization/di [Diagnosis], Choroidal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Color, Color Perception/re [Radiation Effects], Contrast Sensitivity/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Macular Degeneration, Macular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis], Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotope Teletherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy Dosage, Retrospective Studies, Syndrome, Time, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	AIM: The effect of low dose fractionated percutaneous teletherapy to visual acuity and the changes in subfoveolar neovascular membranes in age-related macular degeneration were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 126 eyes of 118 patients (age 55-89 years; mean 74 ys.) were treated. Best distal and near visual acuity was assessed prior to (= initial visual acuity [IVA]) and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after teletherapy. Fluorescein angiography was performed prior to and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after radiation therapy. For analysis patients were divided into different groups by IVA and membrane size. Maximal duration of observation was 36 months. Teletherapy was done by a 9-MeV photon linear accelerator through a lateral port in half-beam technique with a single dose of 2 Gy up to a total dose of 20 Gy within 12 days. RESULTS: No severe negative side effects have been observed. Eight patients reported of epiphora and four patients complained of transient sicca syndrome. Visual acuity decreased more than one line in the group IVA 0.05-0.2. The group IVA 0.3-0.5 remained unchanged for 1 year. We found a tendency for increased visual acuity in group IVA > or = 0.6 for 18 months. After that time both groups showed decreased visual acuity, but all these patients reported of reduced metamorphopsia and increased color and contrast perception. CONCLUSIONS: There is an influence of low dose fractionated percutaneous teletherapy on visual acuity, subfoveal neovascular membranes and metamorphopsia. IVA and duration of anamnesis play an important role. There seems to be no persistent effect; possibly increased dosage will bring a benefit	
1	1424	Effect of heavy-ion radiotherapy on pulmonary function in stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pp [Physiopathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Heavy Ions, Humans, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/pp [Physiopathology], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Respiratory Function Tests, Retrospective Studies	STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of heavy-ion radiotherapy on pulmonary function in patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function	
0	149	Pathological changes in surgically resected angiographically occult vascular malformations after radiation	Cerebral Angiography, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pa [Pathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Research, Retreatment, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the pathological changes associated with radiation treatment (stereotactic radiosurgery or conventional irradiation) of angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe, brain stem, thalamus, or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment. The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient. Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high. Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution. One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin. The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a helium-ion particle beam. The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents. The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous malformations. RESULTS: One irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult. This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of helium-ion radiosurgery. Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately. Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations, six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels, fibrinoid necrosis, and ferrugination. However, the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls. All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels; none were completely thrombosed. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years (mean 3.5 yr) after radiation delivery. It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients. However, recurrent bleeding from AOVMs may relate to poor radiation response in some patients	
0	2124	Four-dimensional treatment planning and fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy for moving tumor	Computer Systems, Feasibility Studies, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Humans, Japan, Movement, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: To achieve precise three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy for mobile tumors, a new radiotherapy system and its treatment planning system were developed and used for clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors	
0	3335	Stereotactic radiosurgery using a linear accelerator	Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Film Dosimetry, Head, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques, Survivors	A basic and clinical study of radiosurgery using the linear accelerator (Linac) system for unremovable deep-seated brain tumors is reported. A Komai stereotactic ring was used to locate the target coordinates. The patient was laid on the Linac treatment table and held in the head fixation system. Irradiation was given in five positions. The dose profile by film dosimetry and Rando phantom was satisfactory. Seventeen tumors in 14 patients were treated. Clinical or histological diagnoses were nine metastases, one benign and two malignant gliomas, one meningioma, and one craniopharyngioma. Tumor sizes were between 8 and 30 mm. Doses were between 12 and 30 Gy. Computed tomographic evaluation after 3 months of 12 tumors in 11 survivors showed one complete remission, three partial remission, six no change, and two partial deterioration. For progressive tumors, Linac radiosurgery results are excellent	
1	2538	Long term visual outcome of radiated uveal melanomas in eyes eligible for randomisation to enucleation versus brachytherapy	Adult, Aged, Brachytherapy, California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Ions, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Mortality, Optic Nerve, Radiation,Ionizing, Radioisotopes, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Vision, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	AIMS: To determine the long term visual outcome of patients who were eligible for randomisation to enucleation versus brachytherapy in a US collaborative ocular melanoma study (COMS) but were treated with either helium ion or 125I radioactive plaque therapy. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 426 ciliochoroidal melanomas that met COMS inclusion criteria for randomisation to enucleation versus radioactive plaque but were treated with either helium ions or 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: At 3 years 36.0% of eyes had 6/12 or better visual acuity. The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision

[French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them	
1	3728	Radiation therapy for arteriovenous malformations: a review.[see comment]. [Review] [65 refs]	Boston, Brain, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Massachusetts, Mortality, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Recurrence, Research	There have been numerous case reports and series of patients treated with partial brain irradiation, linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and Bragg peak therapy for inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These cases are summarized and compared. There is convincing evidence that radiation therapy does have a role in obliterating carefully chosen inoperable lesions. The changes that occur in vessel walls after radiation are reviewed. Data about x-ray and gamma radiation are mostly historical and difficult to evaluate because of the techniques of partial brain irradiation. There is a lack of data about the volume of AVM treated and the minimum dose delivered to the AVM nidus. For gamma knife, heavy particle, and linear accelerator therapy, more complete data are available. The incidence of hemorrhage during the first 2 years after treatment, when radiation-induced vascular changes are proposed to occur, is approximately 2.6% per year for gamma knife therapy, 2% per year for proton beam therapy, 2.3% per year for helium beam therapy, and 2.3% per year for linear accelerator therapy. These rates are similar to the recurrence rate for hemorrhage of 2.2 to 3% per year expected based on the natural history of untreated AVMs. If AVM obliteration after therapy is not achieved, the incidence of recurrent hemorrhage remains between 2% per year after treatment with gamma knife therapy. The incidence of hemorrhage for all patients treated was reported as 0.15% per year in one study and 20% over 8 years in a follow-up study using proton beam therapy. Mortality from hemorrhage after treatment was 0.6% after gamma knife therapy, 2.3% after helium beam therapy, and 2 to 5% after proton beam therapy. These figures for mortality are all lower than the 11% observed for the natural history of untreated AVMs. Permanent neurological deficits experienced as a complication of radiation occurred in 2 to 3% of patients treated with gamma knife therapy, 4% of patients treated with helium beam therapy, 1.7% of patients treated with proton beam therapy, and 3% of patients treated with stereotactic linear accelerator therapy. Proton beam therapy has been used for both small and large lesions. The majority of lesions in patients treated with gamma knife, helium beam, and linear accelerator therapy have been small (usually less than 3.0 cm average diameter) lesions. In these patients with small inoperable lesions treated with accurately directed fields of isocentric radiation, the greatest incidence of AVM obliteration has been observed on follow-up angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 65]

METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma

Patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, schwannoma, and lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the brain were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after treatment with conventional photon and/or proton radiation; samples from healthy volunteers served as controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantitate the cytokines. Before irradiation, most patients had greater amounts of one or more of the cytokines compared with the mean obtained for control plasma. This was especially striking in patients with chondrosarcoma; the mean values for TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, bFGF, and EGF were 1458, 1289, 332, and 92% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. After irradiation, bFGF and total TGF-beta 1 decreased in the majority of tested subjects. In contrast, IL-1 beta was detected only in pediatric patients (all with astrocytoma) and its levels after radiation were 33 to 67% higher than at pretreatment. EGF was found in four patients; post-treatment values were 125 to 608% higher in three of the individuals. These data show that cytokines are present at elevated concentrations in the blood circulation of patients with certain types of brain tumors and that changes in their levels can be detected after radiotherapy. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether these findings contribute to morbidity or therapeutic outcome

Between September 1988 and December 1997 a total of 973 patients (26,916 fields) had been treated on the 66 MeV p+Be isocentric neutron therapy system. Patients are currently being treated according to several protocols, including tumors of the head and neck, salivary gland and breast and soft tissue sarcomas, uterine sarcomas and paranasal sinuses. A multiblade post-collimator trimmer has recently being installed. This device provides improved neutron beam shaping capability. Between September 1993 and December 1997 a total of 243 patients (4008 fields) had been treated (mainly intracranial stereotactic irradiations) on the fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton therapy facility. The facility incorporates an innovative automatic patient positioning system. Two new fixed beam lines for proton therapy are presently being designed (horizontal and 30 degrees to the vertical) for an existing unused treatment vault. Spot scanning systems will be developed for both beam lines

Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned	
1	2395	The Clatterbridge high-energy neutron facility: dosimetry intercomparisons	Belgium, Calibration, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fast Neutrons, Humans, Manikins, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Universities, Washington	Dosimetry intercomparisons have been performed between the Clatterbridge high-energy neutron facility and the following institutions, all employing beams with similar neutron energies: Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium; University of Washington, Seattle, USA; MD Anderson Hospital, Houston, USA; and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, USA. The purpose of the intercomparison was to provide a basis for the exchange of dose-response data and to facilitate the involvement of Clatterbridge in collaborative clinical trials. Tissue-equivalent ionization chambers were used by the participants in each intercomparison to compare measurements of total (neutron plus gamma) absorbed dose in the host institution's neutron beam, following calibration of the chambers in a reference photon beam. The effects of differences in exposure standards, chamber responses in the neutron beams and protocol-dependent dosimetry factors were all investigated. It was concluded that the overall difference in the measurement of absorbed dose relative to that determined by the Clatterbridge group was less than 2%

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1994 and February 2002, 48 patients with histologically confirmed malignant gliomas (16 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 32 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical study. The treatment involved the application of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks of XRT, followed by CRT at 8 fractions/2 weeks. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) were administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) concurrently in weeks 1, 4, or 5 of XRT. The carbon ion dose was increased from 16.8 to 24.8 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 10% incremental steps (16.8, 18.4, 20.0, 22.4, and 24.8 GyE, respectively). RESULTS: There was no Grade 3 or higher acute reaction in the brain. The late reactions included four cases of Grade 2 brain morbidity and four cases of Grade 2 brain reaction among 48 cases. The median survival time (MST) of AA patients was 35 months and that of GBM patients 17 months (p = 0.0035). The median progression-free survival and MST of GBM showed 4 and 7 months for the low-dose group, 7 and 19 months for the middle-dose group, and 14 and 26 months for the high-dose group. CONCLUSION: The results of combined therapy using XRT, ACNU chemotherapy, and CRT showed the potential efficacy of CRT for malignant gliomas in terms of the improved survival rate in those patients who received higher carbon doses

We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor; perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact. All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Another patient had progressive enhancement and low relative cerebral blood volume and flow; biopsy showed necrosis and inflammation. One patient had progressive enhancement and high choline levels (proved anaplastic astrocytoma). In another, T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis); enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up). CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor

N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR AMS. since 1983 using the synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. A "piercing" method with a proton beam of 12 mm in diameter (in one case 10 mm) was employed. Nine patients had unilateral anastomoses with the blood supply from branches of the internal and/or external carotid arteries, and one patient had a bilateral anastomosis. Irradiation was given in 2 fractions, in 2-3 days, the maximum total dose was 50-60 Gy. Regression of ophthalmological symptoms was noted 2-3 months after irradiation. Convalescence was noted in 8 patients, a follow-up period in 2 patients was insufficient. Of 7 patients examined by angiography complete thrombosis of the anastomosis was noted in 4, considerable reduction of the blood flow was noted in 3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

Hence, an improved clinical benefit is to be expected predominantly in large, hypoxic and slowly growing tumors. Since a short course of radiotherapy is required for clinical reasons, it prompted the authors to initiate a randomly controlled trial on locally advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 1999, 27 patients with locally advanced breast cancer were irradiated with photons (60 Gy, 30 fractions; 8 MV, (60)Co) or neutrons (18 Gy, twelve fractions; 66 MeV(p-->Be)). The mean tumor diameters were 699 +/- 399 ml for the photon group and 1,097 +/- 831 ml in the neutron group. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 21.5 months tumor involution was evaluated in 22 patients. Partial and complete remissions were registered in 6/10 patients of the photon group and 5/12 patients of the neutron group. Late grade 3-4 morbidity according to RTOG definition was scored in 5/10 patients in the photon group and in 6/12 patients in the neutron group. With regard to tumor control and late radiation morbidity no differences between the two treatment arms were observed. CONCLUSION: The underlying data indicate that no benefit is to be expected from neutron therapy in breast cancer

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc	
0	4220	Clinical value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for differentiating recurrent or residual brain tumor from delayed cerebral necrosis	Adolescent, Biopsy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Diagnostic Imaging, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm,Residual, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity	PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral necrosis (DN) is a significant risk for brain tumor patients treated with high-dose irradiation. Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

PBT has a half-century history, and more than 35,000 patients have been reported as having had treatments with proton beams worldwide. The historic change to this therapy occurred in the 1990s, when the Loma Linda University Medical Center began clinical activity as the first hospital in the world to utilize a medically dedicated proton therapy facility. Since then, similar hospital-based medically dedicated facilities have been constructed. Results from around the world have shown the therapeutic superiority of PBT over alternative treatment options for ocular melanoma, skull base sarcoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer. PBT is expected to achieve further advancement both clinically and technologically. [References: 15]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1976 and 1992, 167 men with stages T3 to 4 prostate cancer were treated on protocol with 50.4 Gy. photons at 1.8 Gy. per fraction using a 4-field box arrangement, followed by a conformal perineal proton boost of 27 Gy. (cobalt Gy. equivalent) in 11 fractions. The chart was reviewed and 39 of the 42 surviving patients were interviewed. Median followup was 13.1 years (range 7 to 23). Normal tissue morbidity was recorded using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and the late effects normal tissue scale. RESULTS: The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater genitourinary morbidity was 59% at 15 years. However, these grade 2 or greater problems persisted to the time of the interview in only 7 of 39 cases. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater hematuria was 21% at 5 years and 47% at 15. For grade 3 or greater hematuria the risk was 3% and 8% at 5 and 15 years, respectively. No patient required cystectomy but 1 required diversion for morbidity. Urethral stricture and urinary incontinence with pads needed developed in 4 and 3 men, respectively. This particular morbidity was strongly associated with previous or subsequent prostate surgery. The actuarial incidence of grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal morbidity was 13% at 5 and 15 years, while grade 1 rectal bleeding occurred in another 41%. CONCLUSIONS: High dose conformal radiation to the prostate is followed by a high rate of low grade rectal bleeding but a low rate of grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal morbidity. This rate is stable and does not increase beyond 5 years. Genitourinary morbidity continues to develop well into the second decade after treatment, although high grade morbidity is uncommon. These findings do not suggest that the modern trend toward high dose prostate treatment with conformal techniques will result in a high incidence of serious and permanent late sequelae but it appears that hematuria will be common

Results of 5 1/2-year study	Adult, Aged, Computers, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Neoplasm Metastasis, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Proton beam irradiation was used in the treatment of 76 uveal melanomas from July 1975 to December 1980. Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas	
0	2124	Four-dimensional treatment planning and fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy for moving tumor	Computer Systems, Feasibility Studies, Fluoroscopy/mt [Methods], Gold, Humans, Japan, Movement, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostheses and Implants, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: To achieve precise three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy for mobile tumors, a new radiotherapy system and its treatment planning system were developed and used for clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision	
1	950	Dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy for locally advanced head-and-neck cancer.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Dose Fractionation, Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Time	PURPOSE: To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer in a Phase I/II dose escalation clinical trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

It turned out to be a sensitive indicator of the infiltration of the bladder wall. Prior radiotherapy however let to changes which could be falsly interpreted as indicators of malignant infiltration. In order to enhance the accuracy of cytologic evaluation of the urinary sediment in this clinical setting it is essential that the cytologist must be informed about prior radiation therapy

The dilemma of whether to treat by primary irradiation or by conservative surgery is not yet solved. In this study, 67 patients were treated between 1967 and 1987 for anterior commissure carcinoma of the larynx. Radiation was used with 47 patients and conservation surgery with 20 patients. Initial lesion control was achieved with 72% of the patients treated by primary irradiation. Conservation surgery, when used as a primary treatment modality, achieved local control in 90% of the patients. The new techniques of reconstruction of the larynx enhance the surgeon's ability, strengthen his conviction to proceed to enlarged partial laryngectomies, and thus improve the oncologic control of the anterior commissure carcinoma as well

Until radiation therapy gained wide acceptance in the 1980s, enucleation was the standard treatment for the tumor. Long-term results after proton beam irradiation are now available. METHODS: We developed risk score equations to estimate probabilities of the 4 principal treatment outcomes-local tumor recurrence, death from metastasis, retention of the treated eye, and vision loss-based on an analysis of 2069 patients treated with proton beam radiation for intraocular melanoma between July 10, 1975, and December 31, 1997. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 9.4 years. RESULTS: Tumor regrowth occurred in 60 patients, and 95% of tumors (95% confidence interval, 93%-96%) were controlled locally at 15 years. Risk scores were developed for the other 3 outcomes studied. Overall, the treated eye was retained by 84% of patients (95% confidence interval, 80%-87%) at 15 years. The probabilities for vision loss (visual acuity worse than 20/200) ranged from 100% to 20% at 10 years and for death from tumor metastases from 95% to 35% at 15 years, depending on the risk group. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose radiation treatment was highly effective in achieving local control of intraocular melanomas. In most cases, the eye was salvaged, and functional vision was retained in many patients. The mortality rate was high in an identifiable subset of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapies directed at microscopic liver metastases

[French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

Diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases and review of the literature	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Bone, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects

Eight patients (seven males and one female) were suffering from over-irradiation syndrome as a result of treatments from a malfunctioning linear electron accelerator. The mean accidental estimated dose was 136 Gy delivered to the "open-neck" (seven cases) and to the thoracic wall (one case), during a mean of 5.4 sessions (range 1-9 sessions). Paresthesia and weakness in the upper extremities were the earliest symptoms (87.5 %), with evolution to paralysis in all patients. No patient is alive (mean survival time 64 days). In all cases MRI was negative for neurologic lesions in the acute phase ( < 90 days from irradiation; Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system). Late signs of radiation myelitis manifested as high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images in three patients, and as Gd-DTPA enhancement of T1-weighted images in one case. Autopsies performed on four patients who died in acute phase showed morphologic alterations in white matter: edema in 75 %, and necrosis and glial reaction as well as obliterative vasculitis in all cases. In cases of over-irradiation, MRI may be normal in acute phase even if the patients have severe neurologic deficit, as positive MRI findings appear only in delayed radiation myelitis

METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 2000, 90 patients (median age, 51.3 yr; range, 10-85 yr; male/female ratio, 3:2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. Sixty-four patients had a chordoma, and 26 had a chondrosarcoma. The proton component was delivered by the 201-MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay. The median total dose delivered to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 cobalt Gray equivalents (range, 22-70 cobalt Gray equivalents). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 3-74 mo), treatment of 25 tumors failed locally. The 3-year local control rates were 69.2% (+/-6.0%) and 91.6% (+/-8.4%) for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, a small tumor volume excluded from the 95% isodose line (P = 0.032; relative risk [RR], 0.098; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.81) and a controlled tumor (P = 0.049; RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.99) were independent favorable prognostic factors for overall survival. On multivariate analysis, a high minimum dose (P = 0.02; RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.6), a high tumor control probability (P = 0.02; RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.5), a high dose delivered to 95% of the GTV (P = 0.03; RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.15-10.2), a high GTV encompassed by the 90% isodose line (P = 0.01; RR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.29-8.44), and a small GTV excluded from the 90% isodose line (P = 0.036; RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9) were independent favorable prognostic factors for local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the cranial base and cervical spine treated by surgical resection and then by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose uniformity within the GTV. Special attention must be paid to minimize underdosed areas because of the close proximity of critical structures and to redefine and possibly escalate dose constraints to tumor targets in future studies in view of the low toxicity observed to date

The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now

However, the preferred assessment following radiation therapy is local control. PROCEDURE: A review of large group experiences over the past several decades was undertaken to assess the optimal radiation dose and volume for patients with localized, osseous Ewing sarcoma. New approaches and techniques to improve local control were also investigated. RESULTS: With multidisciplinary therapy, 5-year overall local control rates range from 58 to 93%. Following definitive irradiation, they are 53-86%. Recommended radiation therapy doses are 55.8-60.0 Gy. In the postoperative setting, gross disease requires 55.8 Gy; microscopic disease requires 45 Gy. Altered fractionation schemes have not improved local control. The appropriate irradiated volume is an involved field to the pretreatment tumor volume plus 2.0-2.5 cm margin, followed by a boost to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume with margin. Good radiation quality control with central review improves local control. Use of an involved radiation field requires accuracy in defining tumor volume. Techniques to improve local control include risk-adapted multidisciplinary therapy, intraoperative boost radiation, and high radiation doses as delivered by 3-dimensional conformal radiation. Intensity modulated and proton beam radiotherapy may offer an advantage at special sites. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative uses of radiation in the multidisciplinary setting will continue to provide excellent local control, improved function, and quality of life for young patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone.

DESIGN: Noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a series of 63 patients (76 eyes) with choroidal metastases treated with proton beam therapy between December 1989 and September 2000. METHODS: Patients were treated with 2 fractions of 14 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) (CGE = proton Gy x relative biological effectiveness 1.1), each using a nonoperative "light-field" technique. Ophthalmologic follow-up was available for 46 patients (55 eyes), with a mean follow-up time of 10 months. The medical record or the Social Security Death Index was used to obtain survival status, which was available in 94% of cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor regression, recurrence, treatment-associated complications, and visual acuity were evaluated by ophthalmologic examination and ultrasonography. Eye retention and length of survival also were assessed. RESULTS: At the time of ocular diagnosis, 49 patients reported a history of a primary cancer. Median survival time after ocular diagnosis was 16 months through May 2003. Most choroidal metastases were dome shaped (62%) and located at the posterior pole (95%). Mean tumor height was approximately 3.5 mm, and serous retinal detachment was seen in 63% of cases. Eighty-four percent of treated tumors regressed completely within 5 months of treatment, and none of these recurred. Retinal detachment resolved in 82% of patients within 3.8 months after treatment, and visual acuity was preserved or improved in 47% of the patients. Complications occurred in 56% of cases and included madarosis, keratitis, dry eye syndrome, cataract, neovascular glaucoma, chorioretinal atrophy, radiation papillopathy, and radiation maculopathy. None of the treated eyes required enucleation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation is a useful therapeutic approach for choroidal metastases; it allows retention of the globe, achieves a high probability of local tumor control, and helps to avoid pain and visual loss. Although complications occur in most cases, many of these are minor and are not associated with a change in function. This modality is accurate and efficient, because it only entails 2 treatment fractions and does not require surgery for tumor localization

We havefound it necessary to 1) obtain an accurate three-dimensional determination of the treatment volume including the density of all tissues in the beam path; 2) construct an adequate bolus to compensate for tissue heterogeneities; 3) use much more precise and accurate immobilization and patient positioning devices than used in photon irradiation; 4) treat with both protons and photons so as to keep the skin dose within an acceptable level. IN TISSUES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT INHOMOGENETIES DUE TO BONE AND AIR SPACES WE HAVE DELIVEREDA WELL-DEFINED DOSE TO INVOLVED TISSUES WHILE SPARING DISTAL SENSITIVE STRUCTURES. However, in those regions where there is much "fine structure" of tissue density, it has been difficult to compensate satisfactorily for the inhomogeneties	
0	4432	Alopecia associated with unexpected leakage from electron cone	Alopecia/et [Etiology], Electrons, Equipment Failure, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Universities	Excessive irradiation due to unexpected leakage was found on a patient receiving electron beam therapy. The cause of this leakage was analyzed and the amount of leakage was measured for different electron beam energies. The highest leakage occurred with a 6 x 6 cm cone using a 12 MeV electron beam. The leakage dose measured along the side of the cone could be as great as 40%. Until the cones are modified or redesigned, it is advised that all patient setups be carefully reviewed to assure that no significant patient areas are in the side scatter region

Since July 1983, 57 patients with surgically inaccessible AOVMs of the brain were treated using helium ion (47 patients) or linear accelerator (10 patients) radiosurgery. This study retrospectively evaluates the response of these AOVMs to treatment. METHODS: All patients presented with previous hemorrhage. The mean patient age was 35.6 years (range, 13-71 yr). The mean AOVM volume was 2.25 cm3 (range, 0.080-15.2 cm3), treated with a mean of 18.0 Gy equivalent (physical dose x relative biological effectiveness, which is 1.3 for helium ion Bragg peak) (range, 7.0-40 Gy equivalent). The Drake scale scores before treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (26 patients), and poor (6 patients). The mean follow-up period was 7.5 years (range, 9 mo-13.8 yr). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (32%) bled symptomatically (20 hemorrhages) after radiosurgery. Sixteen hemorrhages occurred within 36 months after radiosurgery (9.4% annual bleed rate; 16 hemorrhages/171 patient yr); 4 hemorrhages occurred more than 36 months after treatment (1.6% annual bleed rate; 4 hemorrhages/257 patient yr) (P < 0.001). Complications included symptomatic radiation edema (four patients, 7%), necrosis (one patient, 2%), and increased seizure frequency (one patient, 2%). Eight patients underwent surgical resection of their AOVMs 8 to 59 months after radiosurgery because of subsequent hemorrhage. The Drake scale scores after treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (24 patients), poor (3 patients), and dead (5 patients, 3 of whom died as a result of causes unrelated to the AOVMs or radiosurgery). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery may be useful for AOVMs located in surgically inaccessible regions of the brain. A significant decrease in bleed rate exists more than 3 years after treatment compared with the bleed rate within 3 years of treatment. Because current neuroradiological techniques are not able to image obliterative response in these slow-flow vascular lesions, longer term clinical follow-up is required

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation	
0	4164	Stereotactic percutaneous single dose irradiation of brain metastases with a linear accelerator	Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Female, Hospitalization, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Stereotaxic Techniques, Time	The effectivity of stereotactic percutaneous single dose irradiations in the treatment of solitary brain metastases has been assessed in a series of 12 consecutive patients. Only radioresistant deeply localized metastases have been treated. Photon-irradiation was carried out with the convergent beam technique using stereotactic localization methods, in a linear accelerator facility. In 11 of the 12 patients no side effects occurred. The first 7 patients, who could be observed 3 months or longer, have been studied in detail. In each of these cases single dose irradiation with 20-30 Gy yielded arrest of tumor growth. In one case a marked decrease in contrast enhancement and in four cases shrinkage of the metastasis as well as a marked decrease of the edema occurred. In every patient a marked, sometimes dramatic improvement of the clinical condition was achieved, beginning a few days after irradiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a valuable tool in the treatment of inoperable, radioresistant brain metastases, the major advantage being high efficacy and smoothness of the procedure, as well as extremely short hospitalization times (2-3 days)

Functional imaging of tumor metabolism can help with this task, but the choice of tracer is still controversial. This prospective study following up irradiated low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) was, to our knowledge, the first receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis that intraindividually evaluated the diagnostic performance of the SPECT tracers 3-[(123)I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT) and (99m)Tc(I)-hexakis(2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile) (MIBI) and the PET tracer (18)F-FDG. METHODS: We examined 17 patients, initially with histologically proven LGA and treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, who presented with new gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhancing lesions (n = 26) on MRI. At that time, MRI could not differentiate between progressive tumor and nonprogressive tumor. This MRI examination was closely followed by (18)F-FDG PET and by (99m)Tc-MIBI and (123)I-IMT SPECT. Lesions were classified as progressive tumor (n = 17) or nonprogressive tumor (n = 9) on the basis of prospective follow-up (through clinical examination, MRI, and proton MR spectroscopy) for 26.6 +/- 6.6 mo after PET or SPECT. RESULTS: (123)I-IMT yielded the best ROC characteristics and was the most accurate for classification, with an area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.991. The A(z) of (18)F-FDG (0.947) was not significantly lower than that of (123)I-IMT. The difference in the A(z) of (99m)Tc-MIBI (0.713) from the A(z) of the other tracers used in our study was highly significant (P </= 0.01). (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of low accuracy and, especially, of poor sensitivity even at modest specificity values. CONCLUSION: (123)I-IMT SPECT imaging of amino acid transport accurately detects tumor progression in patients with irradiated LGA. In contrast to (123)I-IMT, (18)F-FDG PET was slightly less accurate for classification, and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of limited value. Imaging of amino acid transport with (123)I-IMT is a valuable additional tool for the follow-up of LGA, allowing early, noninvasive differentiation of lesions with ambiguous morphology after irradiation

Patients with cervix or esophageal cancer were treated with 10 MV X-rays produced at a LINAC accelerator, or high-energy carbon ions produced at the HIMAC accelerator at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba. Blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the radiation treatment. Chromosomes were prematurely condensed by incubation in calyculin A. Aberrations in chromosomes 2 and 4 were scored after fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole-chromosome probes. Pre-treatment samples were exposed in vitro to X-rays, individual dose-response curves for the induction of chromosomal aberrations were determined, and used as calibration curves to calculate the effective whole-body dose absorbed during the treatment. This calculated dose, based on the calibration curve relative to the induction of reciprocal exchanges, has a sharp increase after the first few fractions of the treatment, then saturates at high doses. Although carbon ions are 2-3 times more effective than X-rays in tumor sterilization, the effective dose was similar to that of X-ray treatment. However, the frequency of complex-type chromosomal exchanges was much higher for patients treated with carbon ions than X-ray

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease	
1	2152	Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Brain Stem, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Sex Factors, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Time	PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume

METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5% and 77.5% for Group A and 72.2% and 24.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5%/53% and 86.6%/75.8% for Group A and 69.2%/23% and 77.9%/77.9% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma	
1	924	Influence of patient age on biochemical freedom from disease in patients undergoing conformal proton radiotherapy of organ-confined prostate cancer	Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Life Tables, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Survival, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVES: To examine a large, single-institution series of patients to test the perception among clinicians that radiotherapy is preferred for "older" patients and surgery should be indicated for "younger" men. Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma	
1	4684	Monte Carlo calculations for absolute dosimetry to determine machine outputs for proton therapy fields	Algorithms, Boston, Calibration, Head, Humans, Massachusetts, Methods, Monte Carlo Method, Patients, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation,Ionizing, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Reading, Research, Uncertainty	The prescribed dose in radiation therapy has to be converted into machine monitor units for patient treatment. This is done routinely for each spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) field either by calibration measurements, by using analytical algorithms or by relying on empirical data. At the Northeast Proton Therapy Center, a monitor unit corresponds to a fixed amount of charge collected in a segmented transmission ionization chamber inside the treatment head. The goal of this work was to use a detailed Monte Carlo model of the treatment head to calculate the dose delivered to the patient as a function of ionization chamber reading, i.e. to yield absolute dose in patients in terms of machine monitor units. The results show excellent agreement with measurements. For 50 SOBP fields considered in this study, the mean absolute difference between the experimental and the calculated value is 1.5%, where approximately 50% of the fields agree within 1%. This is within the uncertainties of the data. The Monte Carlo method has advantages over analytical algorithms because it takes into account scattered and secondary radiation, does not rely on empirical parameters, and provides a tool to study the influence of parts of the treatment head on the ionization chamber reading.

Since that time, over 1000 patients have completed treatments and the facility currently treats more than 45 patients per day. With a typical intensity of 3 x 10(10) protons per pulse and 27 pulses per minute, dose rates of 90-100 cGy/min are easily achieved on a 20-cm diameter field. In most cases, patient treatment times are 2 min, much less than the patient alignment time required before each treatment. Nevertheless, there is considerable medical interest in increasing field sizes up to 40-cm diameter while keeping dose rates high and treatment times low. In this article, beam measurements relevant to intensity studies are presented and possible accelerator modifications for upgrades are proposed. It is shown that nearly all intensity losses can be ascribed to the large momentum spread of the injected beam and occur at or near the injection energy of 2 MeV. The agreement between calculations and measurements appears quite good. In addition, optimum beam characteristics for a new injector are discussed based upon the momentum acceptance and space charge limits of the Loma Linda synchrotron	
1	3253	Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy for arteriovenous malformations of the brain	Adolescent, Brain, Cerebral Angiography, Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Child, Child,Preschool, Craniotomy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Headache/et [Etiology], Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Methods, Protons, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Risk, Seizures/et [Etiology]	Patients with arteriovenous malformations of the brain, who are subject to disabling or fatal recurrent hemorrhage, seizures, severe headache, and progressive neurologic deficits, may be considered unsuitable for conventional therapies (craniotomy with excision or embolization), usually because of the location, size, or operative risk of the lesion. We have treated such patients with stereotactic Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy and report the follow-up of 74 of the first 75, 2 to 16 years after treatment. Proton-beam therapy is intended to induce subendothelial deposition of collagen and hyaline substance, which narrows the lumens of small vessels and thickens the walls of the malformation during the first 12 to 24 months after the procedure. Two deaths from hemorrhage occurred in the first 12 months after treatment, but no lethal or disabling hemorrhages occurred after this interval. Seizures, headaches, and progressive neurologic deficits were in most cases arrested or improved. Bragg-peak proton-beam therapy appears to be a useful technique for treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations, especially those that are unsuitable for treatment by other methods

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons	
1	743	Proton beam therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective review of 162 patients	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Palliative Care, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: We present results of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with proton beam therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed 162 patients having 192 HCCs treated from November 1985 to July 1998 by proton beam therapy with or without transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. The patients in the present series were considered unsuitable for surgery for various reasons, including hepatic dysfunction, multiple tumors, recurrence after surgical resection, and concomitant illnesses. The median total dose of proton irradiation was 72 Gy in 16 fractions over 29 days. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for all of the 162 patients was 23.5% at 5 years. The local control rate at 5 years was 86.9% for all 192 tumors among the 162 patients. The degree of impairment of hepatic functions attributable to coexisting liver cirrhosis and the number of tumors in the liver significantly affected patient survival. For 50 patients having least impaired hepatic functions and a solitary tumor, the survival rate at 5 years was 53.5%. The patients had very few acute reactions to treatments and a few late sequelae during and after the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC is effective, safe, well tolerable, and repeatable. It is the useful treatment mode for either cure or palliation for patients with HCC irrespective of tumor size, tumor location in the liver, insufficient feeding of the tumor with arteries, presence of vascular invasion, impaired hepatic functions, and coexisting intercurrent diseases	
0	4666	A case of hepatocellular carcinoma initially treated by carbon ions, followed by protons for marginal recurrence with portal thrombus	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Liver Function Tests, Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Portal Vein, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Thrombosis/rt [Radiotherapy], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), initially treated by carbon ions, then subsequently by protons for marginal recurrence. A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival

1	3871	Estimates of radiogenic cancer risks	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Air, Alpha Particles, Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Incidence, Infant,Newborn, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Mortality, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Skin, Time, Washington	A methodology recently developed by the U.S. EPA for estimating the carcinogenic risks from ionizing radiation is described. For most cancer sites, the risk model is one in which age-specific, relative risk coefficients are obtained by taking a geometric mean of the coefficients derived from the atomic bomb survivor data using two different methods for transporting risks from the Japanese to the U.S. population. The risk models are applied to estimate organ-specific risks per unit dose for a stationary population with mortality rates governed by 1980 U.S. vital statistics. With the exception of breast cancer, low-LET radiogenic cancer risk estimates are reduced by a factor of 2 at low doses and dose rates compared to acute high dose exposure conditions. For low dose (or dose rate) conditions, the risk of inducing a premature cancer death from uniform, whole body, low-LET irradiation is calculated to be 5.1 x 10(-2) Gy-1. Neglecting nonfatal skin cancers, the corresponding incidence risk is 7.6 x 10(-2) Gy-1. High-LET (alpha particle) risks are presumed to increase linearly with dose and to be independent of dose rate. High-LET risks are estimated to be 20 times the low-LET risks estimated under low dose rate conditions, except for leukemia and breast cancer where RBEs of 1 and 10 are adopted, respectively

Sometimes it is not possible either clinically or histologically to differentiate between a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and benign lymphoid hyperplasia. A series of 24 patients is reported. Nineteen were classified as having malignant NHL and 5 benign hyperplasia; 1 of these 5 later developed metastases, however. All patients had systemic work-up: 18 had Stage I, 1 had Stage II, and 5 had Stage IV disease. All patients received local radiation therapy with doses of 2400 to 2750 rad in 2-3 weeks for lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva, and between 3000 and 3750 rad in 3-4 weeks for retrobulbar lesions. The lens was shielded in all patients except in 2 who had NHL of the vitreous body. A method of shielding the lens with a lead block mounted on a "low vac lens" is described, and the dose distribution within the eye and orbit is presented. The dose to the ocular lens is reduced to about 10% of the tumor dose with this technique. Patients who were treated with doses higher than 3000 rad experienced conjunctivitis and skin erythema that resolved completely. No other effects of radiation on normal structures of the ocular adnexa were observed in the 20 patients who are alive and without signs of tumor 10-46 months with a median follow-up time of 22 months

We present a case report that appears to contradict this doctrine. The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and was treated with surgical resection and postoperative proton-beam radiation therapy. Approximately 16 mo after completion of therapy, MRI demonstrated two new regions of enhancement, and an FDG-PET study was performed to further characterize these lesions. FDG-PET demonstrated an area of intense hypermetabolism, and wide surgical resection was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed reactive changes and areas of necrosis. There was no evidence of either recurrent or radiation-induced tumor

A local control rate of 91.5% (43/47) was achieved, and 70% of the patients are alive. 28 patients were irradiated with gross tumour present at the time of neutron therapy (recurrence, incomplete resection, inoperable): a local control was achieved in 5/28 cases (18%), and 68% of the patients are alive. A complication rate of 16% was recorded which was directly related to the treatment volume

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases

Choroidal biopsy confirmed that the clinical diagnosis and conventional radiotherapy to one eye resulted in rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, cataract, and vitreous hemorrhage. We were able to destroy the tumors in the other eye by photocoagulation and proton beam irradiation without any adverse effects. The patient is in good health 1 1/2 years after therapy and he has 6/6 (20/20) vision in the eye that was treated

In our department, between January 1995 to January 2001, we treated eleven patients with mycosis fungoides by total body skin electron irradiation to evaluate its influence. According to our knowledge, our department is the only center in Turkey capable of applying total skin electron beam therapy. Total skin electron beam therapy was applied by using the "translational technique". Daily doses (4 Gray) were given in a total of seven fractions according to the conventional fractionation scheme. There were 6 patients with stage I disease, 3 patients with stage II and 2 patients with stage IV disease. Except stage IV patients, we obtained good cutaneous results. According to our observation, in early stage mycosis fungoides total body skin electron irradiation can provide good cutaneous response, but for stage IV only moderate pallation can be obtained

The data were collected in 1984-1985 by the Patterns of Care Study Survey of Palliative Care conducted in 49 institutions selected to provide valid national averages for the practice patterns reported. Data were collected from 784 patient records selected from five "strata" of practice. Demographic data and process data were tabulated and national averages were calculated from the data. Four metastatic sites were selected, weight bearing bones (401), non-weight bearing bones (102), brain metastasis (224), and lung-mediastinum (57). The median patient age was 63 years, equally divided by sex. In 52% of patients this was the first metastasis. Common Karnofsky performance scores ranged from 40 to 80%. Lung, breast, and prostate were the most common primaries. Two-thirds of the patients were treated by linear accelerators, one-third by cobalt. The median number of fractions was 10, median dose 3000 cGy, median fraction size 300 cGy, and median treatment duration 15 days. The goal of treatment was relief of pain (98%) and return of function (30%) for weight bearing bones, for brain metastasis it was preservation of function (68%), pain relief (33%), and relief of compression (25%). All sites showed TDF values that ranged from 33-85, and a TDF of approximately 65 was most common for weight bearing bones and brain metastasis with no consistent pattern of TDF selection for the other sites. Compliance by strata of practice with work-up criteria was excellent with isolated poor compliance seen in several strata

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects	
0	4328	Monitoring brain tumor response to therapy using MRI segmentation	Adult, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Contrast Media, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Fuzzy Logic, Glioblastoma/pa [Pathology], Glioblastoma/th [Therapy], Humans, Image Enhancement/mt [Methods], Image Processing,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Male, Meningioma/pa [Pathology], Meningioma/th [Therapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Observer Variation, Pattern Recognition,Automated, Reproducibility of Results, Research, Universities	The performance evaluation of a semi-supervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM) clustering method for monitoring brain tumor volume changes during the course of routine clinical radiation-therapeutic and chemo-therapeutic regimens is presented. The tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density, and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing method	
1	2598	Linear accelerator radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: current status	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cerebral Angiography, Child, Female, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/di [Diagnosis], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Complications, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Risk, Time	228 patients affected by cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 100 months (mean 42 months). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 47% of treated patients at one year and 80% at 2 years. 17 haemorrhages were observed after treatment and 6 patients died from them. No bleeding took place after complete angiographic obliteration. 11 patients suffered for radionecrosis. In 6 patients complete recovery was obtained with corticoid medication. The aim of this study is to present our results and to evaluate the effect of irradiation on the risk of bleeding after radiosurgery. Patients were considered at risk in the time lapse after irradiation and before angiographic obliteration or other definitive treatment or death. Patients were followed from the date of radiosurgery and the number of haemorrhages were recorded every six months. In our series the bleeding risk in patients harbouring incompletely obliterated AVMs decreases from 8% in the first year after radiosurgery to 0% starting from the 24th month of the follow-up

1	132	Treatment of brain tumors in children is associated with abnormal MR spectroscopic ratios in brain tissue remote from the tumor site.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Humans, Lactic Acid/me [Metabolism], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Radiotherapy, Research	PURPOSE: Children who have brain tumors are at risk for a variety of treatment-related sequelae, including neuropsychological and cognitive impairment, neurologic deficits, and neuroendocrinologic disturbances. We sought to determine the value of proton MR spectroscopy in assessing brain tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child's treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: In children with brain tumors, MR spectroscopy of brain tissue remote from the tumor reveals treatment-related biochemical changes

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

This conjunctival melanoma arose from primary acquired melanosis with atypia at the temporal corneoscleral limbus. The patient was treated using a combination of surgical excision with physical treatment by ocular proton therapy. Progression remained under control 11 months after treatment: no local tumour recurrence or metastasis was observed. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia must be regarded as a premalignant melanocytic lesion. Based on this case report, the authors focus on primary acquired melanosis and its risk of transformation to a conjunctival malignant melanoma

Technical considerations and results	Aged, Ascites/et [Etiology], Ascites/pc [Prevention & Control], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence/pc [Prevention & Control], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To present technical considerations and results of proton irradiation in a single fraction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with uncontrollable ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

As of 9/92 a total of 28 patients suffering from peripheral (n = 20) or centrally (n = 8) located soft tissue sarcomas had been were treated. Thirteen patients revealed a primary and 15 patients a recurrent tumor. Tumor resection with negative margins was performed in 20 patients, positive margins remained in 5 patients, and gross macroscopic residual disease in 3 patients. Combined intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy was applied in 22 patients, using IORT doses of 10-20 Gy and an external beam dose of 26-50 Gy. Three patients were irradiated intraoperatively twice with a time interval of 24 h. After a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 20 patients are disease free. Two patients died 4 and 5 months after the end of therapy with rapidly progressive distant metastases. An infield failure within the external beam target volume was seen in 1 patient and local failure at the field margin of the external field in 3 patients. So far, there have been no IORT infield failures. Follow-up is performed with magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 patients a second operation was necessary because of a severe wound infection, including one patient suffering from osteomyelitis of a neighboring bone. Mild sensory neuropathy occurred in 1 patient 7 months after treatment. Overall only mild and reversible postoperative and posttherapeutic complications were seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	
1	2516	15 years experience with helium ion radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Survival, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To review the long-term experience of helium ion therapy as a therapeutic alternative to enucleation for uveal melanoma, particularly with respect to survival, local control, and morbidity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)

METHODS: Between 1993 and 2001, 42 patients with meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery at our institution. A mean radiation dose of 14 Gy was delivered to the tumor margin. The median tumor volume was 8.2 cm3 (mean, 8.4 cm3). Median follow-up was 36 months (mean, 38 mo). RESULTS: Control of tumor growth was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. There was no mortality or permanent extraocular motor or pituitary dysfunction. Treatment-related complications included new trigeminal neuropathy in 4.7% and a new visual field defect in 2.8%. Two patients required shunt placement after developing hydrocephalus. One patient with symptomatic temporal lobe edema underwent partial excision of the tumor. Improvement of existing cranial neuropathies was noted in 29% of affected trigeminal nerves, in 22% of oculomotor nerves, and in 13% of Cranial Nerves IV and VI. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that linear accelerator radiosurgery can achieve a high control rate of meningiomas involving the cavernous sinus with no mortality and a low incidence of morbidity	
1	1870	Dose measurements compared with Monte Carlo simulations of narrow 6 MV multileaf collimator shaped photon beams	Belgium, Biophysics, Computer Simulation, Diamond, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiometry/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Universities	Small fields where electronic equilibrium is not achieved are becoming increasingly important in clinical practice. These complex situations give rise to problems and inaccuracies in both dosimetry and analytical/empirical dose calculation, and therefore require other than conventional methods. A natural diamond detector and a Markus parallel plate ionization chamber have been selected for clinical dosimetry in 6 MV photon beams. Results of simulations using the Monte Carlo system BEAM/EGS4 to model the beam geometry have been compared with dose measurements. A modification of the existing component module for multileaf collimators (MLCs) allowed the modeling of a linear accelerator SL 25 (Elekta Oncology Systems) equipped with a MLC with curved leaf-ends. A mechanical measurement method with spacer plates and a light-field edge detection technique are described as methods to obtain geometrical data of collimator openings for application in the Monte Carlo system. Generally a good agreement is found between measurements and calculations of depth dose distributions and deviations are typically less than 1%. Calculated lateral dose profiles slightly exceed measured dose distributions near the higher level of the penumbras for a 10x2 cm2 field, but agree well with the measurements for all other cases. The simulations are also able to predict variations of output factors and ratios of output factors as a function of field width and field-offset. The Monte Carlo results demonstrate that qualitative changes in energy spectra are too small to explain these variations and that especially geometrical factors affect the output factors and depth dose curves and profiles

We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors. However, simultaneous individual anesthetic challenges require pediatric anesthesiologists highly experienced with the pediatric airway, clinical alertness and closed monitoring

However, acute and chronic neurotoxicity has been described following HDMTX therapy, and the long-term intellectual outcome in children treated in this way is inadequately documented. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain is a noninvasive, quantitative way of assessing aspects of cerebral metabolism, which has not previously been applied to the study of children undergoing central nervous system directed therapy. PROCEDURE: To evaluate the potential role of (1)H-MRS in the investigation of related neurotoxicity, 11 children who had received HDMTX (cumulative dose 6-96 g/m(2)) underwent localised (1)H-MRS, magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropsychological assessments were performed on the children who had more than 1 year of follow-up time since last methotrexate treatment. Control (1)H-MRS studies on 11 adult and 6 young volunteers were undertaken. Eight patients had spectra of adequate quality. Comparisons between (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios and normal controls were made. RESULTS: Patients had a low choline/water ratio compared to controls (P < 0.01). No differences between patient and control NAA/water, Cr/water, Naa/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios were seen. Overall, 3 patients had abnormal white matter changes on MRI. The mean IQ of the patients (104.1) was in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that choline depletion in the brains of these patients may reflect subclinical disturbances of myelin metabolism as a result of methotrexate therapy and may represent a possible avenue of treatment in patients with clinical chronic methotrexate-related neurotoxicity.

We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT

DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

METHODS: Patients with invasive bladder cancer, stage T2-3N0M0, were included in the study. Intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed with three injections of methotrexate and cisplatin at 3-week intervals. Simultaneously, the patients underwent X-ray irradiation (40 Gy) of the small pelvic space. Where a post-treatment transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy showed no residual tumor, the tumor site was irradiated by a 30 Gy proton beam and the bladder was preserved. Where tumors remained, radical cystectomy was performed. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1996, 42 patients were treated according to this protocol. Post-treatment TUR biopsy and urine cytology showed no residual tumors in 39 of 42 cases (93%). The bladder was preserved in accordance with the study protocol in 36 cases. A median follow-up of 38 months showed 3-year non-recurrence in 72% of bladder-preserved patients and the rate of bladder preservation was 84%. The nine recurrences included eight cases of superficial bladder recurrence. One cancer death occurred among the bladder-preservation patients, giving 3-year survival and cause-specific survival rates of 84% and 100%, respectively. Although bladder function decreased slightly in compliance, bladder capacity was retained in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is useful for bladder preservation in T2-3 locally invasive bladder cancer. Information from more cases and the results of more long-term observations are needed, as is an evaluation of appropriate subject selection and factors associated with quality of life issues, particularly regarding bladder function	
0	1527	Radiation-induced liver injury showing low intensity on T2-weighted images noted in Budd-Chiari syndrome	Acute Disease, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Budd-Chiari Syndrome/pa [Pathology], Budd-Chiari Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Chronic Disease, Female, Fibrosis, Humans, Iron, Japan, Liver, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Syndrome	PURPOSE: Although it is documented that radiation can cause density or intensity changes on computed tomography or MR imaging in the irradiated hepatic parenchyma, few researchers have reported or understood the MR presentation of changes in hepatic parenchyma following radiotherapy in the patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome. The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis	
0	391	Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units	Dose Fractionation, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Supine Position	Interplay between organ (breathing) motion and leaf motion has been shown in the literature to have a small dosimetric impact for clinical conditions (over a 30 fraction treatment). However, previous studies did not consider the case of treatment beams made up of many few-monitor-unit (MU) segments, where the segment delivery time (1-2 s) is of the order of the breathing period (3-5 s). In this study we assess if breathing compromises the radiotherapy treatment with IMRT segments of low number of MUs. We assess (i) how delivered dose varies, from patient to patient, with the number of MU per segment, (ii) if this delivered dose is identical to the average dose calculated without motion over the path of the motion, and (iii) the impact of the daily variation of the delivered dose as a function of MU per segment. The organ motion was studied along two orthogonal directions, representing the left-right and cranial-caudal directions of organ movement for a patient setup in the supine position. Breathing motion was modeled as sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x), based on functions used in the literature to represent organ motion. Measurements were performed with an ionization chamber and films. For a systematic study of motion effects, a MATLAB simulation was written to model organ movement and dose delivery. In the case of a single beam made up of one single segment, the dose delivered to point in a moving target over 30 fractions can vary up to 20% and 10% for segments of 10 MU and 20 MU, respectively. This dose error occurs because the tumor spends most of the time near the edges of the radiation beam. In the case of a single beam made of multiple segments with low MU, we observed 2.4%, 3.3%, and 4.3% differences, respectively, for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion, between delivered dose and motion-averaged dose for points in the penumbra region of the beam and over 30 fractions. In approximately 5-10% of the cases, differences between the motion-averaged dose and the delivered 30-fraction dose could reach 6%, 8% and 10-12%, respectively for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion. To analyze a clinical IMRT beam, two patient plans were randomly selected. For one of the patients, the beams showed a likelihood of up to 25.6% that the delivered dose would deviate from the motion-averaged dose by more than 1%. For the second patient, there was a likelihood of up to 62.8% of delivering a dose that differs by more than 1% from the motion-averaged dose and a likelihood of up to approximately 30% for a 2% dose error. For the entire five-beam IMRT plan, statistical averaging over the beams reduces the overall dose error between the delivered dose and the motion-averaged dose. For both patients there was a likelihood of up to 7.0% and 33.9% that the dose error was greater than 1%, respectively. For one of the patients, there was a 12.6% likelihood of a 2% dose error. Daily intrafraction variation of the delivered dose of more than 10% is non-negligible and can potentially lead to biological effects. We observed [for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x)] that below 10-15 MU leads to large daily variations of the order of 15-35%. Therefore, for small MU segments, non-negligible biological effects can be incurred. We conclude that for most clinical cases the effects may be small because of the use of many beams, it is desirable to avoid low-MU segments when treating moving targets. In addition, dose averaging may not work well for hypo-fractionation, where fewer fractions are used. For hypo-fractionation, PDF modeling of the tumor motion in IMRT optimization may not be adequate

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome	
0	4304	Preliminary results in heavy charged particle irradiation of bone sarcoma	Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/tu [Therapeutic Use], Bone Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Bone Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, California, Californium, Helium, Humans, Ions, Neon, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Research, Sarcoma, Sarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Sarcoma/mo [Mortality], Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time, Treatment Failure, Universities	Between 1979 and 1989, 17 patients with unfavorable bone sarcoma were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particle irradiation (helium and/or neon ions) at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

The study of tumors attributable to high LET irradiation would greatly augment our insights into the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Chronic low-dose-rate internal exposure to alpha-radiation from thorium dioxide deposits following intravascular administration of the radiographic contrast agent Thorotrast is known to markedly increase the risk of cancer development, especially that of hepatic angiosarcomas and cholangiocarcinomas. Although the mechanism is hypothesized to be via cellular damage, DNA being a major target, wrought by the high LET alpha-particles, the specific genes and the actual sequence of events involved in the process of transforming a normal cell into a malignant one are largely unknown. To shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of cancer development during a lifetime exposure to alpha-radiation, we analyzed the most commonly affected tumor suppressor gene in humans, p53, in 20 Thorotrast recipients who developed cancer, mostly of hepatic bile duct and blood vessel origin. Of the 20 cases, 19 were found to harbor p53 point mutations. Moreover, the accompanying non-tumor tissues from these patients also had p53 mutations, albeit at lower frequency. The distribution pattern of the point mutations was significantly different between the non-tumor and tumor tissues, with most mutations in malignant tissues located in the highly conserved domains of the p53 gene. Our results support the idea that p53 mutations are important in the genesis of Thorotrast-induced tumors but that these point mutations are a secondary outcome of genomic instability induced by the irradiation. Additionally, non-tumor cells harboring p53 mutations may gain some survival advantage in situ but mutations in the domains responsible for the formation of structural elements critical in binding DNA may be necessary for a cell to reach full malignancy

These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

Clinical presentation is related to local invasion. Lesion of the body of the clivus can extend ventrally or dorsally and cause cranial nerve palsies, brain stem compression or hydrocephalus. Pathologically, they form soft, grey masses that are histologically benign but locally invasive and destructive. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging clearly depict the lesion. CT better demonstrates bone destruction and intralesional calcifications. In our case, MR was performed first and showed all the classical signs of skull base chordoma. CT provided complementary information about bone destruction which are also usual in this type of lesion. Major differential diagnoses of the chordoma in the clivus are the other central skull base masses. Biopsy and histology make the diagnosis. Usually treatment consists in surgery and radiotherapy but more recently proton beam therapy is used and seems to yield better results

Chordomas are uncommon primary malignant tumors of bone that typically occur in the axial skeleton including the sacrum, vertebrae, and skull base. The base of skull tumors usually are not amenable to complete surgical resection, and most require postoperative radiotherapy. The natural history of skull base chordoma is typified by slow locally invasive tumor progression and eventual death, although few parameters are known that allow stratification of patients into prognostic groups. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with skull base chordomas treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital by proton beam irradiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up information were reviewed in an attempt to identify clinical and pathologic parameters that predicted outcome. RESULTS. Female sex, tumor necrosis in preradiation treatment biopsy, and tumor volume in excess of 70 ml were each independent predictors of shortened overall survival after radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. CONCLUSIONS. Stratification of patients with skull base chordoma into poor and good outcome groups can be performed using the three parameters identified in our study. In addition, the striking difference in survival between the sexes suggests that further investigations of these tumors should include determination of their hormonal receptors status and consideration of hormonal manipulation in their management

PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: In 41 patients irradiated for unilateral breast cancer the regular scoring by CTC was done during radiotherapy. In parallel, a total of 4,920 spectrophotometric measurements to determine the skin color were performed at baseline, at the beginning of radiotherapy, and at 20, 40 and 60 Gy. The nonirradiated contralateral breast was used for control measurements. RESULTS: As expected, the skin color (especially red) depended on the radiation dose applied to the skin. The objective spectrophotometric measurements were found to correlate well with the subjective CTC scores. CONCLUSION: For classification of acute radiation toxicity there seems to be no need to replace the common CTC scoring by technical methods

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma

1	559	Combined proton beam radiotherapy and transpupillary thermotherapy for large uveal melanomas: a randomized study of 151 patients.[see comment]	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Female, Humans, Hyperthermia,Induced, Informed Consent, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/th [Therapy], Middle Aged, Pupil, Radioisotope Teletherapy, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Retinal Detachment/pc [Prevention & Control], Treatment Outcome, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/th [Therapy]	INTRODUCTION: Exudation from the tumour scar and glaucoma can be major problems after proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma and can sometimes lead to secondary enucleation. We conducted a randomized study to determine whether systematic transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) after proton beam radiotherapy could have a beneficial effect. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between February 1999 and April 2003, all the patients treated by proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas >/=7 mm thick or >/=15 mm in diameter were included in this study after giving their informed consent. One half of the patients received proton beam radiotherapy alone (60 Gy in 4 fractions) and the other half received the same dose of proton beam radiotherapy followed by TTT at 1, 6 and 12 months. All the information concerning the initial tumour parameters, treatments and follow-up was recorded and a statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We randomized 151 patients. The median follow-up was 38 months. The 2 groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender and tumour characteristics. The patients treated with TTT showed a greater reduction of tumour thickness (p = 0.06), less retinal detachment at the latest follow-up (p = 0.14) and a lower secondary enucleation rate (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The present study is the first randomized analysis to demonstrate a significant decrease in the secondary enucleation rate in patients treated with TTT after proton beam radiotherapy. Further studies should be performed to determine whether TTT could be beneficial to smaller tumours and to define its optimal dose. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel

In four cases in which detailed microscopic examinations were performed, radiation induced tumour necrosis was evident but in all four cases viable tumour cells were also observed. No abnormalities that could be attributed to radiation were observed in brain tissue free from tumour. The therapeutic results were comparable to the results achieved by other modern therapies. The results support the view that the RBE of high-energy protons is similar to that for 60Co radiation. It is suggested that a larger radiation dose, delivered by a homogeneous, well-defined proton field could possibly result in an improved therapeutic result without undue risk of injury to normal brain tissue	
1	2972	Radiation maculopathy after proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Color, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Photography, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Research, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Retinal Vessels/re [Radiation Effects], Vision, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: Radiation maculopathy is a microangiopathy of the retina, which is often observed after irradiation of the eye. To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes

Three of these patients had refused to take corticosteroids and the other 11 had failed to respond to them, had experienced side effects, or had other contraindications to their use. After follow-up periods ranging from six months to three years, soft-tissue inflammation was reduced in 13 of the 14 patients. All but two patients showed a decrease in proptosis of 1 to 3 mm. Myopathy showed the least improvement. Although we noted transient eyelid erythema, there were no permanent sequelae and none of the patients has had a recurrence of the inflammation

[French]	Aged, Ciliary Body, Efficiency, Female, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Protons, Recurrence, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	A malignant ciliary body melanoma was treated by proton-beam irradiation. Ring-shaped recurrence with extraocular extension appeared thirty-six months later and required enucleation. Histologic study revealed a predominant epithelioid cell type tumor, flattened in previously treated area. Proton-beam irradiation efficiency depends on clinical evaluation, which remains questioned in ciliary body locations where circumferential extension could be misevaluated	
1	2974	Neurovisual outcome following proton radiation therapy	Adult, Boston, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Color, Eye, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Optic Chiasm, Optic Chiasm/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	From February 1981 to January 1984, 20 patients with a tumor of the upper clivus received proton irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended	
0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children

To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

Longterm follow-up after conventional high voltage radiation in 17 patients and proton therapy in 13 patients confirmed a similar reduction of GH levels in both groups. After 4.5 years a decrease of about 80% was achieved. After "conventional radiation" GH was normal in 8 (47%) and near normal in 6 (35%) while proton therapy resulted in normalization in 5 and improvement in 5 (38%). The slightly better results of "conventional radiation" must be attributed to lower pretreatment levels of GH. Side effects as additional pituitary deficits and oculomotor palsies were more often seen after proton treatment. Since the results of both radiation methods are similar and proton therapy has a tendency to more serious side effects we recommend "conventional radiation" as secondary treatment of acromegaly

Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

On the basis on the results, a phase II study using a regimen of four fractions during 1 week was performed. The purpose of the present study was to determine the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2003, 79 patients with 80 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA NSCLC and 60.0 GyE for stage IB NSCLC in four fractions during 1 week, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.8 years. Sixty-two (78.5%) of these patients were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The data were statistically processed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years or until death, with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months, ranging from 2.5 to 72.2 months. The local control rate for all patients was 90% (T1: 98%, T2: 80%). The patients' 5-year lung cancer-specific survival rate was 68% (IA: 87%, IB: 42%). The overall survival was 45% (IA: 62%, IB: 25%). Half of the deaths were attributable to intercurrent diseases. No toxic reactions in the lung greater than grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion beam radiotherapy with a regimen of four fractions during 1 week has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies	
1	3600	Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors: reduction of the supratentorial target volume	Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Eye, Humans, Methods, Morbidity, Neuroectodermal Tumors,Primitive/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Recurrence, Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: One of the components of radiotherapy (RT) in medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors is the prophylactic irradiation of the whole brain (WBI). With the aim of reducing late neuropsychologic morbidity a CT-scan-based dosimetric study was undertaken in which treatment was confined mainly or exclusively to supratentorial sites considered at high risk for disease recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comparative dosimetric study is presented in which a three field (two laterals and one posterior) proton plan (spot scanning method) is compared with a two-field conventional WBI 6 MV x-ray plan, to a 6-field "hand-made" 6 MV x-ray plan, and to a computer-optimized 9-field "inverse" 15 MV x-ray plan. For favorable patients, 30 Gy were delivered to the ventricles and main cisterns, the subfrontal and subtemporal regions, and the posterior fossa. For the unfavorable patients, 10 Gy WBI preceeded a boost to 30 Gy to the same treatment volume chosen for favorable patients. The dose distribution was evaluated with dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the targets as well as the dose to the nontarget brain and optical structures. In addition, the risks of radiation-related late neuropsychologic effects after WBI were collected from the literature and used to predict normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) for an intelligence quotient deficit after treatment with photon or proton beams. RESULTS: Proton beams succeeded better in reducing the dose to the brain hemispheres and eye than any of the photon plans. A 25.1% risk of an IQ score <90 was predicted after 30 Gy WBI. Almost a 10% drop in the predicted risk was observed when using proton beams in both favorable and unfavorable patients. However, predicted NTCPs for both optimized photon plans ("hand made" and "inverse") were only slightly higher (0.3-2.5%) than those of proton beams. An age-modifying factor was introduced in the predictive NTCP model to assess for IQ differences in relation with age at irradiation. Children with ages between age 4 to 8 benefitted most from the dose reduction in this exercise (similar NTCP predictions for both proton and "inverse" plans). CONCLUSION: Modulated proton beams may help to significantly reduce the irradiation of normal brain while optimally treating the supratentorial subsites at higher risk for relapse. A decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons and both optimized proton plans compared to WBI	
0	354	On the cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. [Review] [18 refs]	Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cost-Benefit Analysis, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Germany, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm,Residual, Physics, Radiation Oncology, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ec [Economics], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	AIM: The cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiotherapy (RT) for patients with skull base chordoma is analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary treatment costs and costs for recurrent tumors are estimated. The costs for treatment of recurrent tumors were estimated using a sample of 10 patients presenting with recurrent chordoma at the base of skull at DKFZ. Using various scenarios for the local control rate and reimbursements of Carbon ion therapy the cost-effectiveness of ion therapy for these tumors is analyzed. RESULTS: If local control rate for skull base chordoma achieved with carbon ion therapy exceeds 70.3%, the overall treatment costs for carbon RT are lower than for conventional RTI. The cost-effectiveness ratio for carbon RT is 2539 Euro per 1% increase in survival, or 7692 Euro per additional life year. CONCLUSION: Current results support the thesis that Carbon ion RT, although more expensive, is at least as cost-effective as advanced photon therapies for these patients. Ion RT, however, offers substantial benefits for the patients such as improved control rates and less severe side effects. [References: 18]	
1	3511	[Results of treatment of Itsenko-Cushing disease using proton irradiation of the hypophysis]. [Russian]	Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Aged, Cushing Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Pituitary Irradiation, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The application of protons (heavy charged particles) for irradiation of the pituitary body has some essential advantages over other types of teletherapy: insignificant destruction of surrounding tissues, a possibility of a single therapeutic session as well as the absence of post-radiation effects. Proton beam therapy was given to 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease aged 15 to 40. Mild cases were treated by proton beam irradiation only while severe cases were managed using proton beam therapy combined with unilateral adrenalectomy or oral administration of ortho-para-DDD. Catamnesis duration varied from 3 to 5 years. In most cases the exposure dose was 80-90 Gy (50-110 Gy). The procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. A dynamic multipolar converting method with 15-20 entrance poles in the left temporal area was employed (with the beam energy of 200 MeV). Stabilization of the course of disease and some clinical improvement were observed in most of the patients 3-4 months after proton beam therapy. In 6-36 months after irradiation 90% of the patients showed normal biochemical indices and the absence of any clinical signs of the disease. Three-five years after treatment, 94% of the patients were in steady remission. A 24-hour ACTH and cortisol normalization pattern was observed in all the patients in parallel with an increase in GH and gonadotropin secretion and a decrease in the prolactin level. Sex function renewal appeared to be the first clinical sign of remission. Young patients aged 15 to 20 with a short duration of disease reached remission faster than patients of the other age groups. Thus the results of proton beam therapy of 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease after a follow-up of 3-5 years showed a high efficacy of this type of treatment. The method can be used alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy as well as with oral administration of ortho-para-DDD	
0	722	Comparative treatment planning on localized prostate carcinoma conformal photon- versus proton-based radiotherapy	Femur/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To assess the potential benefit of proton-beam therapy in comparison to 3-D conformal photon therapy and photon- based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma for various stages of disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation	
1	3650	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: local recurrence after proton beam therapy	Adult, Boston, Cobalt, Eye, Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty-three of 1006 (2.3%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986 received additional treatment for documented (15 patients) or suspected (eight patients) tumor growth in the irradiated eye. Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

[Review] [85 refs]	Canada, Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/th [Therapy], Chemoembolization,Therapeutic, Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Ontario, Pain, Palliative Care, Patients, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Societies, Survival, Universities	Technologic advances have provided the means to deliver tumoricidal doses of radiation therapy (RT) to patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) while avoiding critical normal tissues, providing the opportunity to use RT for curative intent treatment of HCC. For the current report, the expanded role of external beam RT in the setting of HCC from palliation to cure was reviewed. A systematic literature search was undertaken using the MEDLINE data base and secondary references to identify peer-reviewed, English-language articles that reported clinical outcomes after external beam RT alone or in combination with other treatments for HCC. Abstracts from the 2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, American Gastrointestinal Association, and Society of Surgical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium also were included in the search. More than 60 articles reporting on clinical outcomes among patients who received RT for HCC have been published since 1990, including 20 articles that described unique sets of at least 15 patients. RT was used for palliation, to improve local control, and with curative intent in a wide spectrum of patients who most often were unsuitable for surgery and other treatments. Pain reduction following RT was noted in approximately 75% of patients with bone metastases from HCC who received RT. For patients with liver-confined disease treated with conformal RT, proton beam RT, and/or image guided RT with or without transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), local control response rates ranged from 40% to 90%, and the median survival ranges from 10 months to 25 months. For patients with HCC who had portal vein thrombus, the median survival after RT to treat the thrombus and/or the hepatic tumor with or without TACE ranged from 5.3 months to 9.7 months. Although outcomes after high-dose conformal RT for liver-confined HCC were excellent, the potential survival benefit of RT should be tested in randomized controlled trials that require international collaboration. 2006 American Cancer Society [References: 85]

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94%. One patient (2.2%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg

In the former case, aneurysm and large AVM in the left visual tuber were causes of 4 hemorrhages. In the latter, AVM of subcortical nodes and internal capsule were responsible for single hemorrhage. The patients underwent intraoperative embolization of the anterior ciliary artery followed by its clipping. This allowed the authors to exclude aneurysm and to achieve obliteration of the bulk of AVM. Operation were performed under intraoperative guidance of motor and speech functions. Residual AVM were exposed to proton beam radiation. The outcomes of treatment were good. After 4 months of surgery, the male had no neurological disorders; in the female motor and speech disorders were associated with prior hemorrhage. [References: 10]

METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 32 patients underwent surgical resection for suspected progression of brain metastases from a cohort of 245 patients with brain metastases treated with GKR. Postradiosurgery MRI surveillance was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after GKR. In some cases, additional MRI scanning with spectroscopy or perfusion (MRS/P) was used to aid differentiation of radiation change from tumor progression. The decision to perform neurosurgical resection was based on MRI or clinical evidence of lesion progression among patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more and absent or stable systemic disease. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (32 out of 245) of patients and 6% (38 out of 611) of lesions required surgical resection after GKR. The median time from GKR to surgical resection was 8.6 months (range, 1.7-27.1 mo). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival from time of GKR was 97, 78, and 47% for the resected patients and 65, 40, and 19% for the nonresected patients (P < 0.0001). The two-year survival rate of patients requiring two resections after GKR was 100% compared with 39% for patients undergoing one resection (P = 0.02). The median survival of resected patients was 27.2 months (range, 7.0-72.5 mo) from the diagnosis of brain metastases, 19.9 months (range, 5.0-60.7 mo) from GKR, and 8.9 months (range, 0.2-53.1 mo) from surgical resection. Tumor was found in 90% of resected specimens and necrosis alone in 10%. MRS/P studies were performed in 15 resected patients. Overall, MRS/P predicted tumor in 11 lesions, confirmed pathologically in nine lesions, and necrosis alone was found in two. The MRS/P predicted necrosis alone in three, whereas pathology revealed viable tumor in two and necrosis in one lesion. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of progressive brain metastases after GKR in selected patients leads to a meaningful improvement in survival rates. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MRS/P in the postradiosurgery surveillance of brain metastases

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66%) of these were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the data were statistically processed by using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 5 years or until death with a median follow-up time of 59.2 months (range, 6.0-83.0 months). The local control rate for all patients was 94.7%. The patients' 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 75.7% (IA: 89.4; IB: 55.1), and overall survival 50.0% (IA: 55.2; IB: 42.9). No toxic reactions in the lung greater than Grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion radiotherapy, a new treatment modality with superior benefits in terms of quality of life and activity of daily living, has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for Stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

Conventional MR imaging, however, cannot always depict treatment-induced transient WM abnormalities. We investigated the ability of diffusion-tensor (DT) MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy to detect the treatment-induced transient changes within normal-appearing WM. METHODS: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed in 8 patients treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for brain tumors (17 examinations) and 11 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, fractional anisotropy (FA) value, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio were obtained from 27 hemispheres with normal-appearing WM in the patients. We divided the datasets of isotropic ADC, FA, and NAA/Cr, on the basis of the time period after completion of radiation therapy, into 4 groups: group 1 (0-2 months; n = 10), group 2 (3-5 months; n = 5), group 3 (6-9 months; n = 7), and group 4 (10-12 months; n = 5). We compared averages of mean isotropic ADC, mean FA, and NAA/Cr of each patient group with those of the control group by using a t test. RESULTS: In the group 2, averages of mean FA and NAA/Cr decreased and average of mean isotopic ADC increased in comparison with those of the control group (P = .004, .04, and .0085, respectively). There were no significant differences in the averages between the control group and patient groups 1, 3, and 4. CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy can provide quantitative indices that may reflect treatment-induced transient derangement of normal-appearing WM

The use of protons resulted in homogeneous irradiation of a preset target volume without injuring the adjacent organs and tissues. Proton beam irradiation of the uterus was combined with gamma-beam therapy of the zones of regional metastatic spreading. Postradiation reactions were unobserved in the adjacent bladder and rectum in patients receiving combined therapy and irradiation alone. The clinical efficacy of proton beam irradiation was confirmed by the treatment of 160 patients

Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method	
1	4447	Regression patterns of uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation	Adult, Aged, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/co [Complications], Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Research, Retinal Detachment/co [Complications], Uveal Neoplasms/co [Complications], Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Forty-four uveal melanomas were evaluated for patterns of tumor regression after proton beam irradiation. All tumors were followed for a minimum of ten months after treatment. Seven lesions completely disappeared, 33 have decreased in size, and 4 remained unchanged. Associated signs of tumor regression were: resolution of the secondary serous retinal detachments, central apical yellow discoloration of the tumor, destruction of the tumor's vasculature, and elimination of fluorescein leakage. This study demonstrated that regression after proton beam irradiation is a relatively slow process, and the effects of radiation could be observed in some cases more than a year after treatment

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

We have developed a dynamic intravenous coronary angiography (IVCAG) system using synchrotron radiation (SR) and have used it clinically. Four patients suspected of having angina pectoris underwent IVCAG. An SR beam was reflected asymmetrically with a silicon crystal to produce a wide (150 mm x 80 mm) and monochromatic (37 keV) X-ray beam, with an energy level to achieve high sensitivity to the contrast agent. Following an intravenous injection of contrast agent, irradiation was applied for 4 ms periods at 33 ms intervals for dynamic IVCAG at 30 images s-1. Images were acquired with an image intensifier and recorded with a digital fluorography system. The dynamic images permitted clear visualization of the coronary arteries and permitted evaluation of coronary anatomy. Two patients exhibited no stenotic lesions, one patient had a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and the remaining patient had a 25% stenosis at the site of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The total irradiation doses used for IVCAG were less than those for conventional angiography. Dynamic IVCAG can be readily used for the evaluation of coronary arteries

The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings continue to support radiosurgery as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors that results in low rates of morbidity

Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses

The local control rate, cause-specific and overall survival rates of 146 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC were 82.0%, 59.0% and 59.0%, respectively. Radiation pneumonia was not serious and infrequent (2.1%). In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate of 50 patients was 100% without radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 74.0% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beams, excellent local control as in stage I NSCLC has been demonstrated, providing hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS : Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p < 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

This total is made of 20 men and 17 women aged between 19 and 81 years with a mean age of 54.7 years. Tumors were localized in the bulbar conjunctival in 27 cases, in the palpebral conjunctival in 2 cases and were diffuse in 8 cases. Cornea was infiltrated in 19 cases. In 21 cases, the first treatment was made in our service and 16 cases were recurrences following a treatment made elsewhere. The mortality rate to 5 years was 20%. In a multivariant analysis using the COX Model, the height of the tumor was the only significant parameter (p = 0.035) for life expectancy. Recurrence of the tumor (p = 0.060) and presence of a PAM (p = 0.652) were not significant parameters. Benefits of cryocoagulation and indications for a proton beam irradiation are discussed	
1	4203	Use of 42 MeV betatron bremsstrahlung irradiation in the therapy combined with radium in carcinoma of the cervix	Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Cobalt, Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radium, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The article deals with the therapy of cancer of the cervix with external 42 MeV betatron bremsstrahlung irradiation in combination with intracavitary applicated radium. The described irradiation technique using special shielding blocks extends the dose distribution till to the region of paraaortic nodes in an extended field. The extended irradiation field is used on the basis of lymphographic examination. In the region of pelvis minor, sufficiently uniform dose distribution is attained with lethal tumor effect. The dose variability with betatron or cobalt external irradiation was also studied

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation	
1	1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

We studied these changes in the temporal lobe in six patients, following radiosurgery on the amygdala and hippocampus. (1)H MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T with short and long echo times (TE=10 and 135 ms) were used together with standard MR imaging sequences (T1-, T2-weighted). The treatment was performed by Leksell Gamma Knife with a dose of 50 Gy to the center and a 50% isodose to the margin of the target, represented by the mean volume of approximately 7.5 ml. Magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy examinations were performed at least once per year for 3 years. The most significant changes in spectra were observed approximately 1 year after the irradiation when edema in irradiated area was observed and strong signal of lipids was identified. Later, edema and lipid signals disappeared and follow-up was characterized by a decrease of NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations in the ipsilateral region of the brain to the irradiation (LCModel calculation from voxel of interest 3.8-4.5 ml positioned into the centrum of target volume). The concentration of NAA, Cr, and Cho after radiosurgery was significantly different from control values ( p<0.05) and also from concentrations in the contralateral part of the brain ( p<0.05). In the contralateral part, the concentration of NAA was significantly increased ( p<0.05) (NAA: before treatment 8.81, after treatment 11.33 mM). No radiotoxic changes were observed in the contralateral part of the brain or behind the area of target volume. The MR spectroscopy findings precluded MRI observation and MRS results completed data about the development of radiotoxic changes in the target volume	
0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results
