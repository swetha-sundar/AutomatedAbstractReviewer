Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

[Chinese]	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/ae [Adverse Effects], Female, Head, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Quality of Life, Questionnaires, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Water, Xerostomia/et [Etiology]	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: There is few report on the xerostomia of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. Xerostomia is a serious, permanent, and ubiquitous sequelae in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This study was designed to investigate the severity of xerostomia and its impact on the quality of life in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated by conventional radiation therapy in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, were surveyed by interview at the outpatient. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analysis of xerostomia and xerostomia-related problems. RESULTS: Of 136 patents, 73.5% of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. 82.4% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate speech; 92.6% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate chewing and swallowing; 91.2% of the patients changed their feeding pattern (can eat only mashed food); 61.3% of the patients had to wake up to drink water because of dry mouth; 75.0% of the patients had teeth deteriorated. CONCLUSION: 73.5% of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. Xerostomia has a significant impact on the patient's speech, deglutition, sleep, and increases the morbidity rate of the tooth	
0	4083	Proton radiation as boost therapy for localized prostatic carcinoma	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Methods, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectum, Research, X-Rays	A 160-MeV proton beam has been modified to irradiate patients with localized tumors by using convention treatment schedules. This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. RESULTS: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

0	2200	The role of proton therapy in the treatment of large irradiation volumes: a comparative planning study of pancreatic and biliary tumors.[see comment]	Algorithms, Bile Duct Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Bile Duct Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Italy, Kidney, Liver, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Staging, Pancreatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Time, Universities, Vascular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Vascular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vena Cava,Inferior	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefit of proton therapy for abdominal tumors. Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues	
0	4712	Use of peripheral dose data from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation fields to estimate out-of-field organ dose in patients treated employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy	Head, Humans, India, Indium, Jaw, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Phantoms,Imaging, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Scattering,Radiation, Time, Water, Whole-Body Counting, X-Rays	Peripheral doses (PD) from uniform dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) fields were measured for 6 MV x-rays on a Varian linear accelerator using a 0.6 cc ionization chamber inserted at 5 cm depth into a 35 x 35 x 105 cm3 plastic water phantom. PD measurements were also carried out under identical conditions for seven patients treated for head and neck and cervical cancer employing sliding window intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The measured PD from these patient-specific intensity-modulated beams (IMBs) were compared with the corresponding data from uniform DMLC fields having similar jaws setting. The measured PD per monitor unit (PD/MU) decreases almost exponentially with out-of-field distance for all uniform DMLC and static fields. For the same strip field width of 1.2 cm, uniform DMLC fields with a larger size of 14 x 22 cm2 deliver an average of 3.51 (SD = 0.51) times higher PD/MU at all out-of-field distances compared to 6 x 6 cm2. Similar to uniform DMLC fields, PD/MU measured from different patient-specific IMBs was found to decrease almost exponentially with out-of-field distance and increase with increase in field dimension. PD per MU from uniform DMLC fields and patient-specific IMBs having similar jaws setting shows good agreement (+/-7%) except at the most proximal distance, where a variation of more than 10% (maximum 15%) was observed. Our study shows that PD data generated from uniform DMLC fields can be used as baseline data to estimate out-of-field critical organ or whole-body dose in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT if an appropriate correction factor for field dimension is applied. The whole-body dose information can be used to estimate the possible increase in risk of fatal secondary malignancy in patients treated employing sliding window IMRT

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

The cause of this leakage was analyzed and the amount of leakage was measured for different electron beam energies. The highest leakage occurred with a 6 x 6 cm cone using a 12 MeV electron beam. The leakage dose measured along the side of the cone could be as great as 40%. Until the cones are modified or redesigned, it is advised that all patient setups be carefully reviewed to assure that no significant patient areas are in the side scatter region

Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects

The optimum time to use this modality for palliation of symptoms is unclear. Our department treated 44 evaluable patients with upper and lower halfbody radiation. Stratification according to a modified Karnofsky performance scale revealed an 86% response with a notable increase in median duration of survival in those patients exhibiting an initial performance scale of -1. The optimum benefit from halfbody irradiation is derived when administered at the earliest indicated time

The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis. Charged particle radiotherapy can safely deliver high tumor doses to paraspinal tumors with good local control

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HCC for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy. Four patients had renal failure, 2 patients had severe heart disease, 9 patients had severe cirrhosis, 1 patient had aplastic anemia, 1 patient had a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm before treatment, and 4 patients had bleeding tendency or unresectable tumors. Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to iodine, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the tumors ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm). No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for tumor treatments. RESULTS: All but 1 of the irradiated tumors were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years. Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant metastases in the lungs. Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and all recurrent tumors were controlled. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively. Grade > or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with HCC. The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with HCC who had limited treatment options. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society	
1	3619	Is machine energy (4-8 MV) associated with outcome for stage I-II breast cancer patients?	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Methods, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Necrosis, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Pneumonitis, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Risk, Skin, Survivors, Time, Treatment Failure, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between machine energy (4-8 MV) and treatment outcome in patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1968 and 1985, 1624 patients were treated for clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer. The study population was limited to 1380 patients who underwent complete gross excision and received greater than or equal to 60 Gy to the tumor bed. Of these, 1125 were treated on a 4 MV, 153 on a 6 MV, and 102 on an 8 MV linear accelerator. Patients were selected for treatment on the 8 MV machine based on chest wall separations greater than 24 cm. Of patients treated on the 8 MV, netting was used for 42% and bolus was used for 26%. The median dose with bolus was 14 Gy in seven fractions (range: 2-34.2 Gy). Patients treated on the 8 MV accelerator were older, had a higher percentage of clinical T2 tumors, a higher percentage of pathologically positive nodes, and a lower incidence of extensive intraductal component (EIC). Median follow-up times were 130, 153, and 102 months, respectively, for survivors treated on the 4, 6, and 8 MV machines. RESULTS: We analyzed the site and 5-year crude incidence of first failure by machine energy and found the pattern of first failure site (local, nodal, or distant) to be virtually identical for each energy group. Of the local failures, 12 were in the skin of the treated breast, and these failures were evenly distributed by machine energy. We performed a multivariate analysis to adjust for factors known to predict for treatment failure. When adjusted for these other variables, machine energy was not associated with an increased (or decreased) risk of recurrence (RR for 8 MV vs. 4 MV = 0.94, p = 0.7; RR for 6 MV vs. 4 MV = 1.0, p = 0.9). We also analyzed the nature and incidence of treatment complications (rib fracture, radiation pneumonitis, soft tissue necrosis, and brachial plexopathy) and found no significant differences among the three treatment groups when stratified by treatment technique (tangents only vs. three-field). There was also no significant difference in cosmetic outcome at 5 years among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that machine energy over the range of 4 to 8 MV does not significantly affect treatment outcome. Specifically, it was feasible to treat patients with large chest wall separations using an 8 MV machine without an increase in skin recurrences and with the improved dose homogeneity afforded by 8 MV machines as compared with those of lower energies

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer

The results showed that when we employed Gray equivalent as the indication of therapeutic dose, the effects could be explained with simple additive way in the treatment plan. This fact provides important information about the combined therapy of carbon-beam and X-ray	
1	1443	[Quality control of intensity modulated treatments in radiotherapy]. [French]	France, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Quality Control, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Time	Since January 2001, radiotherapy treatments with modulated intensity beams (IMRT) have started at the Centre Oscar-Lambret. This paper presents the tests and measurements made before the clinical implementation as well the quality control performed before each routine treatment. We use the treatment planning system Helax-TMS (MDS-Nordion) and the Primus accelerator (Siemens) linked to the Lantis network with Primeview and Simtec modules (Siemens) allowing to deliver intensity modulated beams with Step-and-Shoot technique. A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a "classical" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique. The next step is the real time dosimetry with a portal imager

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1994 and February 2002, 48 patients with histologically confirmed malignant gliomas (16 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 32 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical study. The treatment involved the application of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks of XRT, followed by CRT at 8 fractions/2 weeks. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) were administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) concurrently in weeks 1, 4, or 5 of XRT. The carbon ion dose was increased from 16.8 to 24.8 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 10% incremental steps (16.8, 18.4, 20.0, 22.4, and 24.8 GyE, respectively). RESULTS: There was no Grade 3 or higher acute reaction in the brain. The late reactions included four cases of Grade 2 brain morbidity and four cases of Grade 2 brain reaction among 48 cases. The median survival time (MST) of AA patients was 35 months and that of GBM patients 17 months (p = 0.0035). The median progression-free survival and MST of GBM showed 4 and 7 months for the low-dose group, 7 and 19 months for the middle-dose group, and 14 and 26 months for the high-dose group. CONCLUSION: The results of combined therapy using XRT, ACNU chemotherapy, and CRT showed the potential efficacy of CRT for malignant gliomas in terms of the improved survival rate in those patients who received higher carbon doses

[Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Biological Markers, Biological Markers/an [Analysis], Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choline/an [Analysis], Female, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/me [Metabolism], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Japan, Lipids, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Time, Treatment Outcome	The evaluation of the response to radiation therapy in brain tumor patients is a major and an important issue. Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages

A number of potentially useful modalities are under study including combinations of debulking surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, hypoxic cell sensitizers and radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and multiple daily fractionation of photon irradiation. Radiotherapy with pions, helium and heavier charged particles have several advantageous characteristics for accomplishing this goal. At the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) we have been studying the use of radiotherapy with helium and heavier charged particles which have several advantageous characteristics for delivery of cancerocidal therapy to deep seated tumors. These include greater localization of the radiation dose to the target volume as well as potentially greater tumor cell-killing potency relative to normal cell damage: A significant lessening of the radiation protective effect of hypoxia on tumor cells may be expected when radiation exposures are made with ions heavier than atomic number 10. Heavy ions also depress enzymatic repair mechanisms, decrease variations in radiosensitivity during the cell division cycle, cause greater than expected delay in cell division and decrease the protective effects of neighbouring cells in organized systems. A potential clinical advantage may result from irradiation with heavy ions in the atomic number range of 10-15 if a significant difference in the above parameters can be found between normal tissues and tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas and 8 had diffuse choroidal hemangiomas (DCH) and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Of the patients, 19 were treated with photons with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy. A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All patients with DCH but 1 were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of all patients. Tumor thickness decreased in 95.4% and retinal detachment resolved in 92.9%. Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected. In all, 40.9% showed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, maximum Grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity. Retinopathy and radiation-induced optic neuropathy were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely. No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected. Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects should be part of the follow-up procedures

Fourteen patients were treated with surgery alone: eight patients with primary tumors in the sacrococcygeal region were treated with radical surgery and four are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) with follow-up of 8 to 20 years. Recurrent tumors in six patients were treated with surgery alone resulting in long palliation (3-25 years). The actuarial survival rate at 5 years for all patients treated with surgery was 76%. Radiation therapy was used in patients after either a biopsy (15), partial excision (17), or before radical excision in 2 patients. To achieve a worthwhile level of palliation, doses greater than 4000 cGy were required. High-dose levels (greater than 6500 cGy) were achieved in nine cases by a combination of photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The results to date of this approach for lesions of the base of skull and cervical vertebral body are encouraging: high local control and low morbidity. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of all patients treated with radiation was 50%

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

The coordinates of specific target landmarks, i.e., bone, calcium deposition or catheters, on baseline CT scans were compared with those measured on control scans. Since the PLATO-SRS system yields 3 coordinates for each target, the final error is calculated by the evaluation of the shift of the different coordinates. The mean error reported for the first material (ORFIT) was 5 mm (13/23 patients). This margin of error is too high and was considered unacceptable; a second material was then tested. The latter, which is not recyclable and softens at higher temperatures, exhibited a mean error of 2.5 mm (10/23 patients), which allows daily repositioning of greater reliability. Treatment was repeated in 4/20 arcs in all, which number depended mainly on fraction size. Correct lesion location and patient positioning were allowed by laser landmarks on the mask made directly on the treatment couch. The laser too was checked before each treatment session, i.e., preferentially at the end of an ordinary working day

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Harvard Medical School, Boston. PATIENTS: From 1991 to 2002, 23 patients with newly diagnosed adenoid cystic carcinoma with skull base extension were treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy. There was tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus in 61% of patients (14), nasopharynx in 61% (14), clivus in 48% (11), and cavernous sinus in 74% (17). The extent of surgery was biopsy alone in 48% (11), partial resection in 39% (9), and gross total resection with positive margins in 13% (3). The median total dose to the primary site was 75.9 cobalt-gray equivalent. The median follow-up of all surviving patients was 64 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Locoregional control and disease-free survival and overall survival rates. RESULTS: Tumors recurred locally in 2 patients at 33 and 68 months, respectively. No patients developed neck recurrence. Eight patients had distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence. The local control rate at 5 years was 93%. The rate of freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years was 62%. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 5 years were 56% and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant adverse factors predictive for overall survival were change in vision at presentation (P = .02) and involvement of sphenoid sinus and clivus (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose conformal proton beam radiation therapy results in a very encouraging local control rate in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the skull base. Changes in vision at presentation and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus and clivus are important prognostic factors

METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed

CASE: A 28 year old white male sought help because of a conjunctival swelling. A biopsy made elsewhere had revealed a capillary haemangioma of the conjunctiva. Recently striking alterations of the skin led to the suspicion of a Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunohistochemical and dermatological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a Kaposi's sarcoma and viral testing of serum revealed an HIV-infection. Besides intensive antiviral therapy, our patient underwent local irradiation of the right eye, the nose and of the left shoulder with an external beam. CONCLUSIONS: Kaposi's sarcoma is the most frequent Aids-associated malignant tumor. In about 30% of all patients with Aids, a Kaposi's sarcoma is diagnosed. The angiomatous character may lead to the histopathological diagnosis of a haemangioma.Human herpes virus 8 is known to be the transforming element

The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. METHODS: Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. RESULTS: The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research

METHODS: Among 249 patients with proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma, the authors identified 59 patients who had visual-field testing performed before treatment and at least 18 months after treatment. The visual fields, color fundus photographs, and charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of radiation papillopathy and visual-field loss after treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 59 patients reviewed (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of radiation papillopathy. Progressive visual-field loss, defined as enlargement of absolute scotoma of greater than [corrected] or equal to 30 degrees as compared with the pretreatment visual field, was noted in 67% of patients with radiation papillopathy and 73% of patients without papillopathy. In both groups, visual-field loss correlated with the area of the retina predicted to be exposed to irradiation in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive visual-field loss is common after proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma. However, the scotoma usually correlates with the area of the retina exposed to irradiation. The development of radiation papillopathy does not appear to be associated with additional visual-field defects in most cases

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

Despite surgical exploration and an extensive diagnostic workup including radiological, nuclear medicine, and computer-assisted tomographic studies, many patients proved to have occult liver metastases manifested within 9 months post treatment. In addition, local and regional control of the primary neoplasm (approximately 20%) has been difficult to obtain even with doses of 6000 equivalent rad in 7 1/2 weeks. Gastric and biliary obstruction have required surgical bypass procedures since irradiation has not been successful in relieving obstructive symptoms. Evidence of gastrointestinal injury has been present in postradiation therapy in approximately 10% of patients, a figure which might be higher if more patients had a longer survival (average 10 months). Some patients require pancreatic enzyme supplementation because of pancreatic deficiency either secondary to tumor or treatment. Further improvement in local control and survival requires better diagnostic methods for evaluation of local and metastatic spread, improved therapy for local and regional disease, as well as therapy directed at occult liver metastases that are frequently present

A Komai stereotactic ring was used to locate the target coordinates. The patient was laid on the Linac treatment table and held in the head fixation system. Irradiation was given in five positions. The dose profile by film dosimetry and Rando phantom was satisfactory. Seventeen tumors in 14 patients were treated. Clinical or histological diagnoses were nine metastases, one benign and two malignant gliomas, one meningioma, and one craniopharyngioma. Tumor sizes were between 8 and 30 mm. Doses were between 12 and 30 Gy. Computed tomographic evaluation after 3 months of 12 tumors in 11 survivors showed one complete remission, three partial remission, six no change, and two partial deterioration. For progressive tumors, Linac radiosurgery results are excellent

METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5% and 77.5% for Group A and 72.2% and 24.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5%/53% and 86.6%/75.8% for Group A and 69.2%/23% and 77.9%/77.9% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1989 and December 1993, 120 consecutive patients underwent linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery, and univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median survival time was 32 weeks. Progressive brain metastases, both local and regional, caused 25 of 104 deaths. Patients with two metastases (n = 30) or a solitary metastasis (n = 70) had equivalent actuarial survival times (P = .07; median, 37 weeks; maximum, 211+ weeks). Patients treated to three or more metastases (n = 20) had significantly shorter survival times (P < .002; median, 14 weeks; maximum, 63 weeks). Prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival included a pretreatment Karnofsky performance status > or = 70% and fewer than three metastases. Delayed radiation necrosis at the treated site developed in 20 patients and correlated with prior or concurrent delivery of whole-brain irradiation and the logarithm of the tumor volume. CONCLUSION: Survival duration is equivalent for patients with one or two brain metastases and is similar to that reported for patients with a solitary metastasis managed by surgical resection and whole-brain irradiation. Survival after radiosurgery for three or more metastases was similar to that reported for whole-brain irradiation

A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients	
0	6	Proton beam therapy for posterior pole circumscribed choroidal haemangioma	Adult, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hemangioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology]	BACKGROUND: Macular and juxtapapillary circumscribed choroidal haemangiomas (CCH) have always posed a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and December 2002, 152 patients were treated at GSI with carbon ion RT. Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions. RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control was 81% for chordomas, 100% for chondrosarcomas, and 62% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas	
1	1164	[Heavy charged particles radiotherapy--mainly carbon ion beams]. [Review] [12 refs] [Japanese]	Carbon, Dose Fractionation, Fast Neutrons, Female, Heavy Ions, Helium, Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Neon, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, X-Rays	Carbon ion beams have superior dose distribution allowing selective irradiation to the tumor while minimizing irradiation to the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions produce an increased density of local energy deposition with high-energy transfer (LET) components, resulting in radiobiological advantages. Stimulated by the favorable results in fast neutrons, helium ions, and neon ions, a clinical trial of carbon ion therapy was begun at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in 1994. Carbon ions were generated by a medically dedicated accelerator (HIMAC, Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan), which was the world's first heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. In general, patients were selected for treatment when their tumors could not be expected to respond favorably to conventional forms of therapy. A total of 1601 patients were registered in this clinical trial so far. The normal tissue reactions were acceptable, and there were no carbon related deaths. Carbon ion radiotherapy seemed to be a clinically feasible curative treatment modality, and appears to offer improved results not only over conventional X-rays but also even over surgery in some selected carcinomas.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 16 primary and 11 recurrent sacral chordoma patients treated from November 1982 to November 2002 by proton/photon radiation therapy alone (6 patients) or combined with surgery (21 patients) have been analyzed for local control, survival, and treatment-related morbidity. The outcome analysis is based on follow-up information as of 2005. RESULTS: Outcome results show a large difference in local failure rate between patients treated for primary and recurrent chordomas. Local control results by surgery and radiation were 12/14 vs. 1/7 for primary and recurrent lesions. For margin-positive patients, local control results were 10 of 11 and 0 of 5 in the primary and recurrent groups, respectively; the mean follow-up on these locally controlled patients was 8.8 years (4 at 10.3, 12.8, 17, and 21 years). Radiation alone was used in 6 patients, 4 of whom received > or =73.0 Gy (E); local control was observed in 3 of these 4 patients for 2.9, 4.9, and 7.6 years. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a high local control rate for surgical and radiation treatment of primary (12 of 14) as distinct from recurrent (1 of 7) sacral chordomas. Three of 4 chordomas treated by > or =73.0 Gy (E) of radiation alone had local control; 1 is at 91 months. This indicates that high-dose proton/photon therapy offers an effective treatment option

On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

A combined CP/CPMG multi-echo, multislice sequence was used to measure T1 and T2 in each pixel with an uncertainty not exceeding 10%. In a prospective clinical study, 12 patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors were investigated. For each ROI in the calculated T1 and T2 parameter images, texture parameters originating from the grey level distribution, the gradient distribution, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the grey level runlength histogram were used for classification and discrimination between tissues. All regions corresponding to the normal brain tissue (white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid) were successfully discriminated from each other as well as from the pathological tissue parts (edema and tumor). The classification of 10 edematous and 8 tumorous tissue regions yielded only one misclassification. Together with additional rules, these discrimination rules formed the knowledge base of an expert system for segmentation of the brain images. In cases of tumors without Gd-DTPA contrast medium uptake or in cases of Gd-DTPA contraindication, segmentated images can help solve nontrivial diagnostical problems such as delineating the target volume in radiation therapy

Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality

METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five radiosurgery patient cases were selected to cover a range of treatment-planning situations from small spherical volumes to large irregular volumes. A target volume consisting of contours drawn on CT transverse slices was prepared for each case. Plans were developed using the three treatment modalities for each case, with the objective of encompassing the target as closely as possible with a prescription isodose line and minimizing dose to normal tissue, within the constraints of current clinical practice. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the target and for normal tissue, and these histograms were used to calculate NTCP and TCP values for each plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in NTCP and TCP values were found to depend on treatment modality, size, shape, and location of the target, the amount of effort devoted to treatment planning, and the complexity of the plan

A retrospective study	Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intestinal Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Intestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Male, Morbidity, Norway/ep [Epidemiology], Particle Accelerators, Questionnaires, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Urologic Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Urologic Diseases/et [Etiology]	48 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer were asked by a mailed questionnaire concerning post-radiotherapy functional status, urological and intestinal complaints. All patients had received curative pelvic irradiation (greater than or equal to 1750 reu) nine to 133 months prior to the investigation. Eleven patients had recurrent or persistent disease and four (36%) of these patients had severe hematuria. The urinary morbidity of the 37 patients without evidence of disease varied between 24 and 38%, but only 3 to 8% of these patients experienced severe disturbances. Four patients (9%) had to undergo bowl resection due to severe radiation damage in the intestines. In conclusion, slight morbidity after curative radiation treatment is to be expected in about 30% of patients surviving more than six months. Severe complications may be expected in 10% of the patients. Serious complaints from the urologic tract, especially hematuria, indicate recurrent or persistent disease rather than a late radiation effect

We report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery in nine patients with ten glomus tumors. All patients were treated either with frame based LINAC or Cyberknife with doses ranging from 1600 cGy to 2500 cGy. Three patients received no previous therapy and one patient received additional external beam radiation for concomitant treatment of carotid body tumors. Patients were then followed for post treatment side effects in addition to change in tumor size by MRI evaluation. The median clinical follow-up time was 26 months (mean 54 months), median radiographic follow-up was 21.5 months (mean 46 months), with a range from 3 to 126 months. The results from our center demonstrated nine of ten tumors to be stable in size by MRI exam, and one tumor which regressed in size. Nine patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one patient experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. Our results continue to support radiosurgery as a suitable form of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors as evidenced by results from this four and a half year follow-up

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84% and 77%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS

Over 100 patients were treated using this system, which is fitted to a Clinac 600C linac. Both cranial and extracranial lesions have been treated using this modality. Immobilization is achieved either with the Talon system for cranial sites or an Aquaplast cast. Target volumes up to 500 cm3 have been treated. Multiple lesions (up to 3) were treated in one setup. The range of dose/fractionation schemes used was 15 Gy/1 fx (radiosurgical treatment) - 80 Gy/40 fx. Dose validation studies were carried out using film and ion chamber dosimetry in a specially designed phantom. Optimal dose distributions were attainable using inverse treatment planning for IMRT delivery. These were found to encompass the target volumes accurately using dose validation phantom studies. Immobilization methods used were accurate to within 1 mm, as evidenced by daily portal films. IMRT using the Peacock system offers the advantage of delivery of conformal therapy to high doses safely and accurately. This provides the opportunity for dose escalation studies, retreatment of previously treated tumors, as well as treating multiple targets in one setup. The system may be fitted to a conventional linac without major modifications

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation

METHODS: Examination of 140 patients following vitreo-retinal surgery ( n=31), brachytherapy ( n=76), proton beam radiation ( n=33) and controls ( n=54) using a questionnaire together with a clinical examination of the anterior segment, tear break-up time and a Schirmer test. RESULTS: Of the treated patients 63% complained of dry eye symptoms versus 40% of the controls ( p=0.004). The tear break-up time was decreased in treated patients ( p<0.001, medians: 15 vs. 20 s). No significant difference was seen on the Schirmer test ( p=0.825; medians: 12 vs. 12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye symptoms are a common postoperative complication following vitreo-retinal surgery and ocular tumour therapy

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

[Review] [121 refs]	Animals, Boron, Boron Compounds/an [Analysis], Boron Compounds/ch [Chemistry], Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Clinical Protocols, Energy Transfer, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Massachusetts, Neutrons, Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiobiology, Survival, Time	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the preferential targeting of tumor cells with (10)B and subsequent activation with thermal neutrons to produce a highly localized radiation. In theory, it is possible to selectively irradiate a tumor and the associated infiltrating tumor cells with large single doses of high-LET radiation while sparing the adjacent normal tissues. The mixture of high- and low-LET dose components created in tissue during neutron irradiation complicates the radiobiology of BNCT. Much of the complexity has been unravelled through a combination of preclinical experimentation and clinical dose escalation experience. Over 350 patients have been treated in a number of different facilities worldwide. The accumulated clinical experience has demonstrated that BNCT can be delivered safely but is still defining the limits of normal brain tolerance. Several independent BNCT clinical protocols have demonstrated that BNCT can produce median survivals in patients with glioblastoma that appear to be equivalent to conventional photon therapy. This review describes the individual components and methodologies required for effect BNCT: the boron delivery agents; the analytical techniques; the neutron beams; the dosimetry and radiation biology measurements; and how these components have been integrated into a series of clinical studies. The single greatest weakness of BNCT at the present time is non-uniform delivery of boron into all tumor cells. Future improvements in BNCT effectiveness will come from improved boron delivery agents, improved boron administration protocols, or through combination of BNCT with other modalities.

These include: 130 patients treated for definitive radiation therapy of choroidal melanoma; 17 patients treated for tumors of the base of skull, cervical spine and cranium, which abut structures of the central nervous system (CNS); 23 patients treated for sarcomas of soft tissue and bone; 65 patients treated for carcinoma of the prostate; 14 patients treated for carcinoma of the rectum and anus; and 23 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the oral cavity and oro-pharynx. Data on causes of failure and morbidity of treatment are presented. Overall the results are judged to be extremely encouraging. In particular, the treatment of the choroidal melanomas and sarcomas abutting CNS structures have clear clinical value, and the treatment of prostatic tumors and tumors of the head and neck are thought to be promising

Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice, but the potential spinal cord injury may limit the extent of resection. We report the long-term results of treatment of six patients diagnosed with giant cell tumor of the spine treated with radiotherapy and review the literature regarding therapy. Between 1971 and 1995, six patients with GCTS were treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy. The surgery consisted of either biopsy or subtotal resection of tumor. The involved vertebrae were then irradiated with doses ranging from 3000 to 5400 cGy. The mean follow-up was 13 years, and three of six patients had follow-up of 17 or more years. Five of six patients are alive with no evidence of disease. One is alive with disease, although it is not clinically apparent. No patient was lost to follow-up. We conclude that radiotherapy is useful in the management of GCTS and that conservative surgery with local radiotherapy is a reasonable treatment alternative for tumors that cannot be completely excised or in which surgery would result in significant functional morbidity. Although there is no clear dose response, review of the literature suggests that doses ranging from 3500 to 4500 cGy are safe and effective in controlling giant cell tumor. [References: 24]

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients	
0	71	Ultrasonographic follow-up of primary choroidal malignant melanoma after proton beam irradiation therapy	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Image Enhancement, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Middle Aged, Mitosis, Protons, Reproducibility of Results, Treatment Outcome, Video Recording, Visual Acuity	The aim of this study is to evaluate the ultrasonographic aspects of primary choroidal malignant melanoma (PCMM) after proton beam irradiation therapy and the reliability of its ultrasonographic follow-up in a series of 10 patients. All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy

A Komai stereotactic ring was used to locate the target coordinates. The patient was laid on the Linac treatment table and held in the head fixation system. Irradiation was given in five positions. The dose profile by film dosimetry and Rando phantom was satisfactory. Seventeen tumors in 14 patients were treated. Clinical or histological diagnoses were nine metastases, one benign and two malignant gliomas, one meningioma, and one craniopharyngioma. Tumor sizes were between 8 and 30 mm. Doses were between 12 and 30 Gy. Computed tomographic evaluation after 3 months of 12 tumors in 11 survivors showed one complete remission, three partial remission, six no change, and two partial deterioration. For progressive tumors, Linac radiosurgery results are excellent

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

This report details our experience with proton treatment of these tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-seven patients with pituitary adenomas treated with protons, who had at least 6 months of follow-up, were included in this analysis. Forty-two patients underwent a prior surgical resection; 5 were treated with primary radiation. Approximately half the tumors were functional. The median dose was 54 cobalt-gray equivalent. RESULTS: Tumor stabilization occurred in all 41 patients available for follow-up imaging; 10 patients had no residual tumor, and 3 had greater than 50% reduction in tumor size. Seventeen patients with functional adenomas had normalized or decreased hormone levels; progression occurred in 3 patients. Six patients have died; 2 deaths were attributed to functional progression. Complications included temporal lobe necrosis in 1 patient, new significant visual deficits in 3 patients, and incident hypopituitarism in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: Fractionated conformal proton-beam irradiation achieved effective radiologic, endocrinological, and symptomatic control of pituitary adenomas. Significant morbidity was uncommon, with the exception of postradiation hypopituitarism, which we attribute in part to concomitant risk factors for hypopituitarism present in our patient population	
1	4678	Phase II feasibility study of high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer using proton boost therapy: first clinical trial of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer in Japan	Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Feasibility Studies, Gastrointestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Humans, Japan, Male, Male Urogenital Diseases/et [Etiology], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Patients, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Proctitis/et [Etiology], Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Safety, Seminal Vesicles, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome, Urination Disorders/et [Etiology]	OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer using proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy. METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan

The greatest challenge of this project is to realize treatment of a moving target by scanning irradiation. For this purpose, we decided to combine the rescanning technique and the gated irradiation method. To determine how to avoid hot and/or cold spots by the relatively large number of rescannings within an acceptable irradiation time, we have studied the scanning strategy, scanning magnets and their control, and beam intensity dynamic control. We have designed a raster scanning system and carried out a simulation of irradiating moving targets. The result shows the possibility of practical realization of moving target irradiation with pencil beam scanning. We describe the present status of our design study of the raster scanning system for the HIMAC new treatment facility

Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year

METHODS: Examination of 140 patients following vitreo-retinal surgery ( n=31), brachytherapy ( n=76), proton beam radiation ( n=33) and controls ( n=54) using a questionnaire together with a clinical examination of the anterior segment, tear break-up time and a Schirmer test. RESULTS: Of the treated patients 63% complained of dry eye symptoms versus 40% of the controls ( p=0.004). The tear break-up time was decreased in treated patients ( p<0.001, medians: 15 vs. 20 s). No significant difference was seen on the Schirmer test ( p=0.825; medians: 12 vs. 12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye symptoms are a common postoperative complication following vitreo-retinal surgery and ocular tumour therapy

Three of these patients had refused to take corticosteroids and the other 11 had failed to respond to them, had experienced side effects, or had other contraindications to their use. After follow-up periods ranging from six months to three years, soft-tissue inflammation was reduced in 13 of the 14 patients. All but two patients showed a decrease in proptosis of 1 to 3 mm. Myopathy showed the least improvement. Although we noted transient eyelid erythema, there were no permanent sequelae and none of the patients has had a recurrence of the inflammation

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Amifostine was given as daily intravenous application (500 mg) 10 to 15 minutes prior to radiotherapy in 20 patients. The results were compared with another collective of patients which was similar. RESULTS: According to the WHO score mucositis became manifest in 10 patients (Grade I) and 4 patients (Grade II) in the amifostine group vs 9 patients (Grade II), 6 patients (Grade III) and 1 patient (Grade IV) in the control group. Xerostomia has been seen in 15 patients (Grade I) and 5 patients (Grade II) after administration of amifostine. Without the drug 2 patients suffered from xerostomia (Grade I), 8 patients (Grade II) and 8 patients (Grade III), respectively. Administering amifostine had been feasible and non problematic. Only a small rate of toxic side effects like nausea (11%) or emesis (4%) was documented. CONCLUSIONS: Amifostine is an effective radioprotector decreasing acute and late side effects in patients with head and neck tumors	
1	3162	Linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases:the influence of number of lesions on survival	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Karnofsky Performance Status, Life Tables, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Predictive Value of Tests, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Risk, Survival, Survival Analysis, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities	PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the number of brain metastases on survival after stereotaxic radiosurgery and factors that affect the risk of delayed radiation necrosis after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1989 and December 1993, 120 consecutive patients underwent linear accelerator-based stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery, and univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median survival time was 32 weeks. Progressive brain metastases, both local and regional, caused 25 of 104 deaths. Patients with two metastases (n = 30) or a solitary metastasis (n = 70) had equivalent actuarial survival times (P = .07; median, 37 weeks; maximum, 211+ weeks). Patients treated to three or more metastases (n = 20) had significantly shorter survival times (P < .002; median, 14 weeks; maximum, 63 weeks). Prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival included a pretreatment Karnofsky performance status > or = 70% and fewer than three metastases. Delayed radiation necrosis at the treated site developed in 20 patients and correlated with prior or concurrent delivery of whole-brain irradiation and the logarithm of the tumor volume. CONCLUSION: Survival duration is equivalent for patients with one or two brain metastases and is similar to that reported for patients with a solitary metastasis managed by surgical resection and whole-brain irradiation. Survival after radiosurgery for three or more metastases was similar to that reported for whole-brain irradiation

All tumors were followed for a minimum of ten months after treatment. Seven lesions completely disappeared, 33 have decreased in size, and 4 remained unchanged. Associated signs of tumor regression were: resolution of the secondary serous retinal detachments, central apical yellow discoloration of the tumor, destruction of the tumor's vasculature, and elimination of fluorescein leakage. This study demonstrated that regression after proton beam irradiation is a relatively slow process, and the effects of radiation could be observed in some cases more than a year after treatment

The results of clinical trials with fast neutrons have shown that carcinoma of the salivary gland and the prostate and Pancoast tumor of the lung were indications for fast neutron therapy, and that the patients suffering from osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma had indications for fast neutrons when fast neutrons were combined with surgery. Neither carcinoma of the pancreas nor glioblastoma multiforme had indications because of complications of normal tissues.

The melanomas measured 7 to 15 mm at the tumor base and 2 t0 5 mm thick. First, photocoagulation using the green argon laser was aimed at closing the choroidal vascular supply of the tumor. In a second stage, tumor tissue was destroyed using the red krypton laser for confluent burns of long duration. Such treatment was supplemented by cryotherapy in peripherally located tumors or whenever photocoagulation alone did not result in tumor regression. Photocoagulation alone was used in ten eyes and combined wih cryotherapy in seven. After an average follow-up of 42 months, marked tumor regression was achieved in 12 eyes and some tumor regression in two. Tow eyes ultimately required proton beam irradiation, and one eye was enucleated. No metastasis occurred during follow-up

Twenty-six patients were randomized to neutrons, and 14 patients were randomized to photons. The randomization was purposefully unbalanced in favor of the experimental treatment. The complete response rate for the neutron-treated group of patients was 52%. The complete response rate for the photon-treated group of patients was 17%. The difference is statistically significant at the p = .04 level. The two-year survival rates for the neutron-treated group and the photon-treated group were 25 and 0%, respectively. The major complication rates were not statistically significantly different for the two groups (18% for neutrons, and 33% for photons)

This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

Patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, chondrosarcoma, meningioma, schwannoma, and lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the brain were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after treatment with conventional photon and/or proton radiation; samples from healthy volunteers served as controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantitate the cytokines. Before irradiation, most patients had greater amounts of one or more of the cytokines compared with the mean obtained for control plasma. This was especially striking in patients with chondrosarcoma; the mean values for TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, bFGF, and EGF were 1458, 1289, 332, and 92% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. After irradiation, bFGF and total TGF-beta 1 decreased in the majority of tested subjects. In contrast, IL-1 beta was detected only in pediatric patients (all with astrocytoma) and its levels after radiation were 33 to 67% higher than at pretreatment. EGF was found in four patients; post-treatment values were 125 to 608% higher in three of the individuals. These data show that cytokines are present at elevated concentrations in the blood circulation of patients with certain types of brain tumors and that changes in their levels can be detected after radiotherapy. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether these findings contribute to morbidity or therapeutic outcome

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study reviewed 46 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 1998 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All patients had locoregionally confined disease; all but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 46 patients, 40 received combinations of X-rays (median, 48 Gy) and protons (median, 31.7 Gy) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-ray and proton radiation for the 40 patients was 76.0 Gy (range, 69.1-87.4 Gy). The remaining 6 patients received only proton beam therapy (median, 82.0 Gy; range, 75-89.5 Gy). RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 46 patients, patients with T1 (n = 23), and those with T2-T4 (n = 23) was 34%, 55%, and 13%, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for the 46 patients, those with T1, and those with T2-T4 was 67%, 95%, and 33%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate for patients with T1 and T2-T4 lesions was 83% and 29%, respectively. The site of the first relapse was locoregional for 16 patients and distant organs for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally confined esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedule, and best combinations of protons and conventional X-rays with or without chemotherapy

Two different chemotherapy regimens were used for concurrent chemoradiation. In the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was infused intravenously, followed immediately by five consecutive daily administrations of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2/day, each infused intravenously over 24 hr. As for the patients with adenocarcinoma, 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 250 mg/m2 of cytoxan and 45 mg/m2 of adriamycin were administered intravenously on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 54.4% with stage III and IV, 62.6% with lymph node metastasis on computed tomogram or MRI, 77.9% with stage I-II disease with lesion size > or =4 cm, and 50.3% with small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Side effects from concurrent chemoradiation such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were present in all 395 cases. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were observed to varying degrees, but there was no toxic death. This study suggests that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation in treating cervical cancer patients with high risk factors is effective and relatively well tolerated, with acceptable toxicity	
1	264	Setup verification and in vivo dosimetry during intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for prostate cancer	Calibration, Catheterization, Electrons, Humans, Italy, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Male, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiometry/is [Instrumentation], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Software, Urethra/pa [Pathology]	The purpose of this study was to check the setup and dose delivered to the patients during intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IORT) for prostate cancer. Twenty eight patients underwent IORT after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer by means of a dedicated mobile accelerator, Novac7 (by Hitesys, SpA, Italy). A 9 MeV electron beam at high dose per pulse was used. Eighteen patients received IORT at escalating doses of 16, 18, and 20 Gy at 85% isodose, six patients for each dose level. Further, ten patients received 20 Gy at 85% isodose. The electron applicator position was checked in all cases by means of two orthogonal images obtained with brilliance intensifier. Target and organ at risk doses were measured in vivo by a MOSFETs dosimetry system. MOSFETs and microMOSFET dosimeters were inserted into sterile catheters and directly positioned into the rectal lumen, for ten patients, and into the bladder to urethra anastomosis, in the last 14 cases. Verification at 0 degree led to very few adjustments of setup while verifications at 90 degrees often suggested to bring the applicator closer to the target. In vivo dosimetry showed an absorbed dose into the rectum wall < or =1% of the total dose. The average dose value inside the anastomosis, for the 12 patients analyzed, was 23.7 Gy with a standard deviation of +/-7.6%, when the prescription was 20 Gy at 85% isodose. Using a C-arm mobile image intensifier, it is possible to assess if the positioning is correct and safe. Radio-opaque clips and liquid were necessary to obtain good visible images. In vivo MOSFETs dosimetry is feasible and reliable. A satisfactory agreement between measured and expected doses was found

This total is made of 20 men and 17 women aged between 19 and 81 years with a mean age of 54.7 years. Tumors were localized in the bulbar conjunctival in 27 cases, in the palpebral conjunctival in 2 cases and were diffuse in 8 cases. Cornea was infiltrated in 19 cases. In 21 cases, the first treatment was made in our service and 16 cases were recurrences following a treatment made elsewhere. The mortality rate to 5 years was 20%. In a multivariant analysis using the COX Model, the height of the tumor was the only significant parameter (p = 0.035) for life expectancy. Recurrence of the tumor (p = 0.060) and presence of a PAM (p = 0.652) were not significant parameters. Benefits of cryocoagulation and indications for a proton beam irradiation are discussed	
1	2182	Benign meningioma: partially resected, biopsied, and recurrent intracranial tumors treated with combined proton and photon radiotherapy	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Boston, Child, Combined Modality Therapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Meningeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningeal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Meningioma/pa [Pathology], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Necrosis, Optic Nerve, Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/mo [Mortality], Radiation Injuries/pa [Pathology], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Analysis	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recurrence-free survival and complications of combined proton and photon radiotherapy of patients with incompletely resected or recurrent histologically-confirmed benign meningioma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1981 and November 1996, 46 patients with partially resected, biopsied, or recurrent meningiomas (median age of 50 years; range 11-74 years) were treated with combined photon and 160-MeV proton beam therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, using computed tomography-based conformal 3D treatment planning. Nine patients were treated after incomplete tumor resection, 8 patients after tumor biopsy only, and 29 patients after tumor recurrence following gross total (10/29 patients) or progression after subtotal (19/29 patients) resection. All patients were classified as benign meningioma on review slides at MGH. The median dose to the macroscopic gross tumor volume was 59.0 CGE (range 53.1-74.1 CGE, CGE = proton Gy x 1.1 RBE). The median follow-up was 53 months (range 12-207). RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 93 and 77%, respectively, and the recurrence-free rate at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 88%, respectively. Survival without severe toxicity was 80% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients presented with local tumor recurrence at 61, 95, and 125 months. One patient developed distant intradural metastasis at 21 and 88 months. No patient died from recurrent meningioma; however, 4 patients died of other causes. A fifth patient died from a brainstem necrosis after 22 months. Eight patients developed severe long-term toxicity from radiotherapy, including ophthalmologic (4 patients), neurologic (4 patients), and otologic (2 patients) complications. All patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic nerve structures in the current protocol. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with recurrent or incompletely resected benign intracranial menigiomas. Observed toxicity appears to be dose-related; with currently employed dose constraints, toxicity should not exceed that seen in patients treated with conformal fractionated supervoltage photon radiotherapy	
0	1939	Fractionated, three-dimensional, planning-assisted proton-radiation therapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: a novel technique	Biopsy, Boston, Child, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hypothalamus, Male, Massachusetts, Optic Chiasm, Orbit, Orbit/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Survivors, Temporal Lobe, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Most children with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma will survive their disease. However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Amifostine was given as daily intravenous application (500 mg) 10 to 15 minutes prior to radiotherapy in 20 patients. The results were compared with another collective of patients which was similar. RESULTS: According to the WHO score mucositis became manifest in 10 patients (Grade I) and 4 patients (Grade II) in the amifostine group vs 9 patients (Grade II), 6 patients (Grade III) and 1 patient (Grade IV) in the control group. Xerostomia has been seen in 15 patients (Grade I) and 5 patients (Grade II) after administration of amifostine. Without the drug 2 patients suffered from xerostomia (Grade I), 8 patients (Grade II) and 8 patients (Grade III), respectively. Administering amifostine had been feasible and non problematic. Only a small rate of toxic side effects like nausea (11%) or emesis (4%) was documented. CONCLUSIONS: Amifostine is an effective radioprotector decreasing acute and late side effects in patients with head and neck tumors	
1	380	Survival after primary enucleation for choroidal melanoma: changes induced by the introduction of conservative therapies	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Eye Enucleation/mo [Mortality], Female, Humans, Knowledge, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND: Most uveal melanomas are currently treated by eye-preserving radiotherapies. However, for melanomas of the largest size or with initial complications, enucleation remains the reference treatment. Enucleation is called primary when it is proposed as the only local treatment option for a melanoma. There is very little literature on the use of primary enucleation after the introduction of conservative treatments. Our main goal was to evaluate the survival of melanoma patients treated by primary enucleation since the introduction of proton-beam therapy in France in 1991. METHODS: All melanoma patients undergoing primary enucleation in our department between 1991 and 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Forty patients, representing 8% of all patients with choroidal uveal melanoma diagnosed and followed up in our department during an 11-year period, were included in the study. No patient was lost to follow-up. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 31.45% (SE: 7.8) after primary enucleation. Significant prognosis factors in the multivariate analysis were: tumor thickness > 12 mm (p = 0.03), anterior margin of the tumor involving the iris (p = 0.018), and presence of epithelioid cells (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The very low survival rate reported reflects the evolution of primary enucleation, which is currently indicated only for melanomas with the worst prognosis. The knowledge of current post-enucleation survival rates represents an essential achievement for both correct assessment of conservative therapies and patient counseling

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma

When it was diagnosed, it measured 6mm in thickness and 11.9mm for the largest diameter and had a typical mushroom shape. General investigations found no metastatic disease. It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment. Neovascular glaucoma is a major complication that very often leads to enucleation

METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects with subfoveal CNVM due to AMD were randomly assigned to 16-Gy proton irradiation delivered in two fractions 24 hours apart or to sham control treatment. Recruitment was halted at 37 subjects for ethical reasons regarding randomization to sham treatment when Food and Drug Administration approval of Visudyne was anticipated. RESULTS: Proton irradiation was associated with a trend toward stabilization of visual acuity, but this association did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found within the fluorescein angiography data, including greatest linear dimension of CNVM total size, area of active leakage, area of associated subretinal hemorrhage, and intensity. CONCLUSIONS: With the acceptance of photodynamic therapy, future studies will require more complex design and larger sample size to determine whether radiation can play either a primary or adjunctive role in treating these lesions

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful	
0	1986	Comparison of proton therapy and conformal X-ray therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)	Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Physics, Planning Techniques, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/st [Standards], Research, Risk, X-Ray Therapy	This study compares the performance of one proton and four conformal X-ray planning techniques in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

Tumors were irradiated with 2,500 rad at each of four to five sessions, with an interval of one to two days between sessions. The melanomas ranged in diameter from 8 to 20 mm and were from 3.0 to 13.7 mm in thickness. Patients were followed up for three months to seven years. In 11 cases, the tumor was fully resorbed. Complications included radiation cataract, postradiation glaucoma, radiation retinopathy, and exudative retinal detachment. In 12 cases, enucleation was performed because tumor growth persisted. Four patients died during follow-up period because of metastasis. The eye was preserved in 47 cases

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted	
1	2094	Conformal proton beam therapy of prostate cancer--update on the Loma Linda University medical center experience	Actuarial Analysis, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: The ability to eradicate localized prostate cancer is dependent upon the radiation dose which can be delivered to the prostate. This dose is often limited by the tolerance of normal organs (rectum, bladder). Conformal beam therapy takes advantage of the unique depth dose characteristics of heavy charged particles (the Bragg Peak) to escalate the radiation dose delivered to the prostate while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. METHOD: 643 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons alone or a combination of protons and photons. All treatment was planned on a 3-D planning system and all received doses between 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE/day. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response to treatment. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates for the entire group are 89 and 79% respectively. A statistically significant difference in biochemical disease-free survival was seen between patients in the "early" (T1b-2b, PSA < 15) and "advanced" (T1b-2b, PSA > 15 or T2c-T4, PSA < 50) subgroups (89% vs. 68% at 4.5 years, p < 0.001). A PSA nadir of less than 0.51 ng/ml predicted for the highest chance of freedom from biochemical recurrence. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton beams therapy produced high rates of response and minimal toxicity. A phase III dose escalation trial is in progress to help define the optimum radiation dose for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer

It is characterized by high signal on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Radiation-induced endothelial cell damage resulting in blood-nerve barrier breakdown is hypothesized to produce this pattern, but histologic evidence of this in the optic nerve is lacking. We attempted to evaluate the effect of radiation on endothelial cells in the optic nerve. DESIGN: Case-controlled histologic study. METHODS: We studied the optic nerves of 16 enucleated eyes from patients with uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation, 6 from normal eyes and 5 from eyes with unirradiated uveal melanomas. Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) lectin was used to identify endothelial cells in single paraffin sections. Transverse and longitudinal sections of vessels were counted in masked fashion. RESULTS: There were 49.4+/-6.9 transversely sectioned endothelial cells per millimeter of nerve in 6 optic nerves exposed to 0 to 1000 cGyE ("low-dose") compared with 17.3+/-5.3 in 10 nerves exposed to 5500 to 7000 cGyE ("high-dose") (P = 0.002). Longitudinally sectioned vessels stained with UEA-I were separately identified, with 11.5+/-2.1 in the low-dose group and 5.6+/-1.6 in the high-dose group (P = 0.044). The thickness and staining of the endothelial cell layer appeared greater in the high-dose group. Endothelial cell counts did not correlate with age, gender, acuity, or interval after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased radiation dosage to the optic nerve correlates with smaller numbers of endothelial cells

Histopathologic findings in a successfully treated case	Choroid/pa [Pathology], Eye, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Radiation, Research, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	A 47-year-old man with a large (20 X 20 X 12-mm) choroidal melanoma in his only eye was treated with helium ion radiation. The patient retained 6/7.5 visual acuity for 2 1/2 years before he was killed in an automobile accident. The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

[French]	Aged, Ciliary Body, Efficiency, Female, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Protons, Recurrence, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	A malignant ciliary body melanoma was treated by proton-beam irradiation. Ring-shaped recurrence with extraocular extension appeared thirty-six months later and required enucleation. Histologic study revealed a predominant epithelioid cell type tumor, flattened in previously treated area. Proton-beam irradiation efficiency depends on clinical evaluation, which remains questioned in ciliary body locations where circumferential extension could be misevaluated

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis

Three of these patients had refused to take corticosteroids and the other 11 had failed to respond to them, had experienced side effects, or had other contraindications to their use. After follow-up periods ranging from six months to three years, soft-tissue inflammation was reduced in 13 of the 14 patients. All but two patients showed a decrease in proptosis of 1 to 3 mm. Myopathy showed the least improvement. Although we noted transient eyelid erythema, there were no permanent sequelae and none of the patients has had a recurrence of the inflammation

A progressive reduction in glandular volume (of low, medium, and high grade) was observed in 48/50 patients respectively within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and 6-9 months after treatment. After 9 months only lesser modifications were observed. A statistically significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between volume decrease percentage and histologic grading of the tumor, but not with its stage. Within the groups of patients affected with similar-grade neoplasms, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) was observed, relative to the decrease rate of prostatic volume, between the patients with complete response and those with partial or no response. US monitoring of prostatic volume after radiotherapy, if correlated with histologic grading, can yield early predictive elements as to treatment outcome, thus contributing to select non-responsive patients to submit to biopsy and, if necessary, to therapeutic alternatives or combinations. Longer-term studies are needed to prove its effectiveness, to prognostic purposes, in the single patient	
0	342	Proton-beam therapy for olfactory neuroblastoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Disease-Free Survival, Esthesioneuroblastoma,Olfactory/di [Diagnosis], Esthesioneuroblastoma,Olfactory/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasal Cavity, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pc [Prevention & Control], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Nose Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Nose Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Retrospective Studies, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To analyze the feasibility and efficacy of proton-beam therapy (PBT) for olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) as a definitive treatment, by reviewing our preliminary experience. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

[German]	Aged, Electrons, Humans, Male, Neoplasms,Hormone-Dependent/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Testis, Testosterone/bl [Blood]	Irradiation of the tests of 11 patients with carcinoma of the prostate in the age from 68 to 78 years with 20 Gy (5 X 2 Gy per week) decreased the plasma testosterone levels to an average of 70,3% of the initial values. After operative orchidectomy, however, a decrease of the plasma testosterone level to only 5% the values before operation was observed. Therefore, the operative orchidectomy cannot be replaced by the irradiation of the testes. Higher irradiation doses may cause skin injuries and there is the possibility of being a real carcinogen noxe for the irradiation region too

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy

A comparative treatment- planning study was done to assess the capability of both modalities to preserve vision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ten patients treated with 68-MeV protons, SRT with 6-MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuity (fovea and optic disk, optic nerve) were contoured identically for both therapies. Safety margins of 1.5 mm for proton therapy were reduced to 1.0 mm for SRT. RESULTS: Proton-beam therapy was superior in eight of ten situations, and this result did not differ significantly by changes in the weighting of the different parameters analyzed. CONCLUSION: When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into account, under the conditions examined proton therapy offers an advantage in the majority of the patients evaluated

This study evaluates modern LINAC technology for the creation of a sharp, small and functionally eloquent lesion in the thalamus. METHODS: Three patients underwent thalamotomy using a dedicated linear accelerator to radiosurgery, 2 females and 1 male, ages were 52, 53, and 73 years. Two patients presented with unilateral poststroke central pain and 1 with unilateral upper extremity pain secondary to metastatic infiltration of the brachial plexus. Maximal doses varied from 150 to 200 Gy, delivered by a 5-mm diameter collimator and 5 to 8 noncoplanar arcs evenly distributed. RESULTS: All patients gained substantial relief of their pain. They were able to reduce their medications and improve their activity levels. The patient with end-stage metastatic disease died of his malignancy 2 weeks after the treatment. One patient presented with recurrence of the pain 4 months after the treatment. No clinical complications were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated linear accelerator is able to perform a precise and circumscribed lesion in the thalamus for pain control. Moreover, it proved to be safe, because no complications were observed. For patients using chronic anticoagulant therapy or with severe disabilities caused by cardiac, pulmonary or malignant diseases, this technique represents an alternative of treatment to radiofrequency thalamotomy

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

DESIGN: The study design was a nonrandomized, retrospective clinical study. Semiparametric and nonparametric statistical techniques were used. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred sixty-six posterior uveal melanoma patients were studied. INTERVENTION: Either iodine-125 plaque or helium ion radiation therapy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local tumor recurrence and systemic metastasis were measured. RESULTS: Local tumor recurrence was detected in 66 (8.6%) of 766 irradiated tumors. The 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 10%. The recurrence pattem was horizontal/marginal in 27 patients (41%) and vertical/diffuse in 39 patients (59%). Systemic metastasis was detected in 5 patients (19%) with horizontal/marginal recurrence and in 19 patients (49%) with vertical/diffuse recurrence. After known metastatic risk factors were controlled, the relative risk for metastasis was 2.2 for horizontal/marginal recurrence and 5.1 for vertical/diffuse recurrence (P = 0.05). The actuarial rate of systemic metastasis was 2.9% per year for all patients, 6.3% per year for patients with horizontal/marginal recurrence, and 15.5% per year for patients with vertical/diffuse recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Postirradiation local recurrence of posterior uveal melanoma is a risk factor for systemic metastasis. Vertical/diffuse recurrences may be associated more strongly with metastatic disease than horizontal/marginal recurrences

METHODS: Nine ependymoma patients have been treated with SRS (four with linear accelerator and five with Gamma Knife) since 1990. Two patients had WHO grade III tumors, and the remaining seven had WHO grade II tumors. Eight of nine patients received external beam radiation therapy at some point prior to radiosurgery to a total median dose of 54 Gy. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 14 to 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 35 years. Four patients developed progressive disease following radiosurgery, and two patients have died of progressive disease. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 55.6%. The 3-year overall survival was 71.1%. Patients treated with radiosurgery as a component of initial treatment (generally as a boost following external beam) had an improved relapse-free survival (100%) compared to those treated with radiosurgery to salvage an external beam local failure (20%).

The development of optimized treatment plans for X-rays and protons followed by a comparative evaluation is one method of selecting tumor sites best suited for proton treatment. The preliminary results of comparative treatment planning for base of skull tumors and carcinoma of the prostate are discussed. These comparisons suggest a clinical gain for proton treatment of tumors in these locations. The clinical experience with fractionated proton treatment of several tumor sites is also discussed. The results of high dose proton treatment of chordomas and low grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull is particularly promising: an actuarial 5-year local control of 78% has been obtained in 50 patients followed for a minimum of 22 months	
1	2913	Prognostic factors for metastasis following proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas	Adult, Age Factors, Ciliary Body, Female, Humans, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Lung Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Metastasis, Prognosis, Protons, Skin Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Survival, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Prognostic indicators for the development of metastasis following proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas were evaluated for 510 patients treated from 1975 to 1984. Thirty-three patients developed metastasis (6.5%) from 3 to 51 months following treatment. The primary site of metastasis was the liver in 28 cases (85%). Both demographic and clinical factors were considered. The three leading predictors of survival without metastasis after proton beam irradiation in order of importance were: (1) largest diameter of the tumor; (2) location of the anterior margin of the tumor; and (3) age at treatment. Worse prognosis was associated with largest tumor diameter greater than 15.0 mm, tumor involvement of the ciliary body and age at treatment older than 59 years

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 uveal melanoma patients were treated with helium-ions using a single-port treatment technique. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, the NVG complication rate was analyzed according to the percent of anterior chamber in the radiation field, tumor size, tumor location, sex, age, dose, and other risk factors. Several University of California San Francisco-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) patients in each size category (medium, large, and extralarge) were retrospectively replanned using two ports instead of a single port. By using appropriate polar and azimuthal gaze angles or by treating patients with two ports, the maximum dose to the anterior segment of the eye can often be reduced. Although a larger volume of anterior chamber may receive a lower dose by using two ports than a single port treatment. We hypothesize that this could reduce the level of complications that result from the irradiation of the anterior chamber of the eye. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the lens, and compared for the single and two-port techniques. RESULTS: NVG developed in 121 (35%) patients. The risk of NVG peaked between 1 and 2.5 years posttreatment. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the percent of lens in the field was strongly correlated with the development of NVG. Other contributing factors were tumor height, history of diabetes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Dose-volume histogram analysis of single-port vs. two-port techniques demonstrate that for some patients in the medium and large category tumor groups, a significant decrease in dose to the structures in the anterior segment of the eye could have been achieved with the use of two ports. CONCLUSION: The development of NVG after helium-ion irradiation is correlated to the amount of lens, anterior chamber in the treatment field, tumor height, proximity to the fovea, history of diabetes, and the development of vitreous hemorrhage. Although the influence of the higher LET deposition of helium-ions is unclear, this study suggests that by reducing the dose to the anterior segment of the eye may reduce the NVG complications. Based on this retrospective analysis of LBNL patients, we have implemented techniques to reduce the amount of the anterior segment receiving a high dose in our new series of patients treated with protons using the cyclotron at the UC Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL)

Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements	
1	374	A technique of partial breast irradiation utilizing proton beam radiotherapy: comparison with conformal x-ray therapy.[see comment]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Heart, Humans, Immobilization, Immobilization/is [Instrumentation], Prone Position, Protons, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, Vacuum, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To develop a breast immobilization system and clinical technique to deliver partial breast irradiation with a proton beam and compare dose distributions using proton therapy and conformal x-rays. METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival	
1	2094	Conformal proton beam therapy of prostate cancer--update on the Loma Linda University medical center experience	Actuarial Analysis, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Rectum, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: The ability to eradicate localized prostate cancer is dependent upon the radiation dose which can be delivered to the prostate. This dose is often limited by the tolerance of normal organs (rectum, bladder). Conformal beam therapy takes advantage of the unique depth dose characteristics of heavy charged particles (the Bragg Peak) to escalate the radiation dose delivered to the prostate while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. METHOD: 643 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons alone or a combination of protons and photons. All treatment was planned on a 3-D planning system and all received doses between 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE/day. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response to treatment. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates for the entire group are 89 and 79% respectively. A statistically significant difference in biochemical disease-free survival was seen between patients in the "early" (T1b-2b, PSA < 15) and "advanced" (T1b-2b, PSA > 15 or T2c-T4, PSA < 50) subgroups (89% vs. 68% at 4.5 years, p < 0.001). A PSA nadir of less than 0.51 ng/ml predicted for the highest chance of freedom from biochemical recurrence. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal proton beams therapy produced high rates of response and minimal toxicity. A phase III dose escalation trial is in progress to help define the optimum radiation dose for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. RESULTS: In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors	
0	1186	Comparison of a micro-multileaf collimator with a 5-mm-leaf-width collimator for intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Equipment Design, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Retrospective Studies, Software, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation]	PURPOSE: To dosimetrically compare a micro-multileaf collimator (minimum leaf width of 3 mm) with the 5-mm-leaf multileaf collimator (MLC) of a standard linear accelerator for stereotactic conformal radiotherapy treatment of intracranial lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service	
1	712	[Chordomas of the base of the skull and upper cervical spine. 100 patients irradiated by a 3D conformal technique combining photon and proton beams].

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years, range: 8-85, M/F sex-ratio: 3/2), were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered by the 201 MeV proton beam of the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). The median total dose delivered to the gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-71). A complete surgery, incomplete surgery or a biopsy was performed before the radiotherapy in 16, 75 and 9 cases, respectively. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 1-87), 25 tumours failed locally. The 2 and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, less than 95% of the tumour volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line (P=0.048; RR: 3.4 IC95% [1.01-11.8]) and a minimal dose less than 56 CGE (p=0.042; RR: 2.3 IC95% [1.03-5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2 and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%). According to multivariate analysis, a controlled tumour (P=0.005; RR: 21 IC95% [2.2-200]) was the lonely independent favourable prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSION: In chordomas of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated by surgical resection followed by high-dose photon and proton irradiation, local control is mainly dependent on the quality of radiation, especially dose-uniformity within the gross tumour volume. Special attention must be paid to minimise underdosed areas due to the close proximity of critical structures and possibly escalate dose-constraints to tumour targets in future studies, in view of the low toxicity observed to date

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

METHODS: Retrospective review of 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. Several parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis techniques were used. RESULTS: In 218 eyes treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma, the mean dimension for largest basal diameter was 11.9 mm (range 5 mm to 24 mm). The mean tumor thickness was 6.7 mm (range 1.3 mm to 14.2 mm). Following helium ion radiation 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. At 10 years after radiation 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes were enucleated; the majority (37 of 46) of enucleations were due to anterior ocular segment complications. At 10 years after radiation 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; half had non-tumor related deaths and 51 died from metastatic melanoma. Best corrected visual acuity after radiation was > or = 20/40 in 21 of 93 eyes of patients that were alive and retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors that were less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm away from the nerve or the fovea, 13 of 18 (72%) retained > or = 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of acuity. The actuarial enucleation rate at 5 years was 17.2% (2.7% S.E.) and at 10 years this was 22.4% (3.1% S.E). The recurrence tumor control rate at both 5 and 10 years was 5.3% (S.E 1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion radiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In tumors that are less than 6 mm in thickness and greater than 3 mm from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision. Approximately one-half of the deaths 10 years after treatment were due to non-tumor-related causes

Technique and radiobiologic implications	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Child, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation Dosage, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Time	In the authors' technique, the stereotactically localized target is fixed to the isocenter of a 4 MV linear accelerator. The irradiation is carried out along 9-17 non-coplanar arcs distributed on a 160 degrees cylindrical sector. High doses (10-50 Gy) are delivered in one or two sessions. From 1982, 65 patients have been treated (shortest follow-up 6 months). The dose was chosen according to the pathology and to the volume of the lesion. Good clinical results have been obtained in low-grade gliomas, acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and other selected types of intracranial lesions. Therapeutic effects in terms of clinical condition and size of the lesions have been plotted in relation to time elapsed and dose employed

Common to all of these methods is the time-dependent change of certain accelerator parameters during radiation treatment. The accelerators for which these methods can be used are equipped with independent collimator jaws, however, not with any kind of multileaf collimation. This method was designed to deposit a certain group of dose distributions that are restricted by a small number of constraints. The developed methods were implemented into a digitally controlled medical linear accelerator and the dosimetric results of such treatments were evaluated. Dose distributions with spatial dependencies in one and in two dimensions were deposited by movement of one X-ray jaw pair. Furthermore, a method for generation of a two-dimensional rotationally symmetric dose distribution was developed

There are several methods of managing them. Validity of these methods, however, is not sufficiently studied. We therefore investigated, whether moist skin care with 3% urea lotion will reduce acute radiation skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with carcinomas of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy with curative intent (mean total dose 60 Gy, range: 50-74 Gy) were evaluated weekly for acute skin reactions according to the RTOG-CTC score. In 63 patients, moist skin care with 3% urea lotion was performed. The control group consisted of 25 patients receiving conventional dry skin care. The incidence of grade I, II, and III reactions and the radiation dose at occurrence of a particular reaction were determined and statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. The dose-time relations of individual skin reactions are described. RESULTS: At some point of time during radiotherapy, all patients suffered from acute skin reactions grade I, > 90% from grade II reactions. 50% of patients receiving moist skin care experienced grade I reactions at 26 Gy as compared to 22 Gy in control patients (p = 0.03). Grade II reactions occurred at 51 Gy versus 34 Gy (p = 0.006). Further, 22% of the patients treated with moist skin care suffered from acute skin toxicity grade III as compared to 56% of the controls (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Moist skin care with 3% urea lotion delays the occurrence and reduces the grade of acute skin reactions in percutaneously irradiated patients with head and neck tumors	
0	4027	Charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas	Adult, Aged, Biopsy, California, Californium, Chordoma, Chordoma/ep [Epidemiology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neon, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Pain, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Sacrum, Spinal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Analysis, Syndrome, Universities, Wound Healing	PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is determine the impact of charged particle irradiation at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) in treating patients with sacral chordomas. Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted	
0	3984	Precision, high dose radiotherapy. II. Helium ion treatment of tumors adjacent to critical central nervous system structures	Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Ions, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In this paper we present a technique for treating relatively small, low grade tumors located very close to critical, radiation sensitive central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain stem. A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

To understand better these relations, four groups of cases were examined: 1.) 126 choroidal melanomas which were treated conservatively with Cobalt 60 applicator from 1969 till 1984. 2.) 715 choroidal melanomas which have been treated with proton-beam from 1984 to 1989. 3.) 7 tumors or pseudotumors for which for diagnostic purposes a phosphorus 32 test was necessary. 4.) 9 choroid melanomas which had conservative treatment and where vitrectomy was realized. The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment the thickness of the tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in choroid melanoma which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 1997, 102 patients with multiple cancer metastases received half-body irradiation (HBI) at the Center of Oncology--Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute in Krakow. Most of the patients (93/102) had bone metastases (Table 1). The HBI was performed with 9 MV photon beam from linear accelerator. In 88 patients only one region (upper, mid or lower) was treated, and 14 patients received upper and lower HBI (13 patients), or upper and mid HBI (one patient) (Table 2). The mean doses were: 6 Gy in upper HBI, 8 Gy in mid HBI, and 9 Gy in lower HBI (Table 3). RESULTS: The positive palliative effect (complete or partial pain relief) was observed in 77 (75.5%) patients (Table 4). Complete pain relief was higher in patients with prostate cancer, and in patients who received mid or lower HBI. During follow-up 47 (46.1%) patients developed pain progression after treatment (Table 5). The probability of survival without pain progression was higher in patients who developed complete pain relief (86.7% at 6 months, 69.3% at 12 and 24 months) than in patients with partial response (52.9% at 6 months, 32.8% at 12 months, and 5.5% at 24 months) (Figure 1). In most of the patients (74/102, 72.5%) the tolerance was good. CONCLUSIONS: HBI is an efficient method for palliation in patients with multiple painful metastases

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart

An additional 30 tumors in the total patient population were treated with 100 kVp x-rays to assess comparative effects on skin nodules and 8 patients received additive photon or electron radiation to pion-treated portals. Of 52 evaluable tumors in 20 patients treated with pions only and followed for 3 to 22 months, 81% (42 tumors) completely regressed; 6% (3 tumors) partially regressed; and 13% (7 tumors) did not respond, although 5 of the 7 have shown no growth for 10 months. Of eight tumors in seven patients treated with a combination of pions and conventional radiation, three tumors showed complete response and five tumors showed partial response, though the resected specimens in two (one with complete and one with partial response) revealed no tumor microscopically. Reactions in normal tissues have been mild, with some patients exhibiting no normal tissue reaction, as compared with relatively marked tumor response

This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

In the case of proton therapy, secondary neutrons generated in the accelerator head and inside the patient reach many areas in the patient body. Due to the improved efficacy of management of cancer patients, the number of long term survivors post-radiation treatment is increasing substantially. This results in concern about the risk of radiation-induced cancer appearing at late post-treatment times. This paper presents a case study to determine the effective dose from secondary neutrons in patients undergoing proton treatment. A whole-body patient model, VIP-Man, was employed as the patient model. The geometry dataset generated from studies made on VIP-Man was implemented into the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code. Two proton treatment plans for tumours in the lung and paranasal sinus were simulated. The organ doses and ICRP-60 radiation and tissue weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. Results show whole body effective doses for the two proton plans of 0.162 Sv and 0.0266 Sv, respectively, to which the major contributor is due to neutrons from the proton treatment nozzle. There is a substantial difference among organs depending on the treatment site

The carbon-ion beams were accelerated with the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). Six primary cultures obtained by biopsy from 6 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were irradiated with two different mono-LET beams (LET = 13 keV/micrometer, 76 keV/micrometer) and 200kV X rays. Residual chromatin breaks were measured by counting the number of non-rejoining chromatin fragments detected by the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique after a 24 hour post-irradiation incubation period. The induction rate of residual chromatin breaks per cell per Gy was the highest for 76 keV/micrometer beams on all of the cells. Our results indicated that cell which was more sensitive to the cell killing was similarly more susceptible to induction of residual chromatin breaks. Furthermore there is a good correlation between these two end points in various cell lines and primary cultured cells. This suggests that the detection of residual chromatin breaks by the PCC technique may be useful as a predictive assay of tumor response to cancer radiotherapy

Conventional MR imaging, however, cannot always depict treatment-induced transient WM abnormalities. We investigated the ability of diffusion-tensor (DT) MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy to detect the treatment-induced transient changes within normal-appearing WM. METHODS: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed in 8 patients treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for brain tumors (17 examinations) and 11 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, fractional anisotropy (FA) value, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio were obtained from 27 hemispheres with normal-appearing WM in the patients. We divided the datasets of isotropic ADC, FA, and NAA/Cr, on the basis of the time period after completion of radiation therapy, into 4 groups: group 1 (0-2 months; n = 10), group 2 (3-5 months; n = 5), group 3 (6-9 months; n = 7), and group 4 (10-12 months; n = 5). We compared averages of mean isotropic ADC, mean FA, and NAA/Cr of each patient group with those of the control group by using a t test. RESULTS: In the group 2, averages of mean FA and NAA/Cr decreased and average of mean isotopic ADC increased in comparison with those of the control group (P = .004, .04, and .0085, respectively). There were no significant differences in the averages between the control group and patient groups 1, 3, and 4. CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy can provide quantitative indices that may reflect treatment-induced transient derangement of normal-appearing WM

Heavy charged particle radiotherapy offers the potential advantages of improved dose localization and/or enhanced biologic effect, depending on particle selected for treatment. Target sites have included selected head and neck tumors, ocular melanomata, malignant gliomata of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the stomach, carcinoma of the pancreas, selected juxtaspinal tumors and other locally advanced, unresectable tumors. A Phase III prospective clinical trial has been started in carcinoma of the pancreas using helium ions. Phase I-II studies are underway with heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions in order to prepare for prospective Phase III trials. Silicon ions are also under consideration for clinical trial. These studies are supported by the United States Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

Over the last 10 months, we've evaluated its contribution to the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by means of accelerated proton beam irradiation. MATERIAL: Using UBM, we have examined 55 cases of uveal melanoma's, whose anterior border was situated at 6 mm or less from the limbus and that were consequently treated by proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The presumed tumoral origin was the ciliary body's pars plicata in 13 cases and the pars plana or the choroid in 42 cases, 17 of which presented a tumoral invasion of the pars plicata. A pars plana detachment anterior to or surrounding the anterior tumoral border, was present in 22 cases. The height of the tumor could only be measured by UBM if it was less than 2.5 mm. Information gathered using UBM have contributed to an improvement of the therapy plan in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Because of the strong attenuation of the high frequency ultrasound signal, UBM can only be used for the examination of intra-ocular structures situated in direct neighbourhood to the global wall. Despite this technical limitation, ist contribution to the planning of the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by proton beam irradiation has appeared to be considerable

Some commonly used formulas for predicting risk are based on extrapolation from small numbers of animal experiments, pilot human treatment series, and theoretical radiobiological considerations. The authors studied the incidence of complications after AVM radiosurgery in relation to dose, volume, and other factors in a large patient series. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in 1329 patients with AVM treated by Dr. Raymond Kjellberg at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between 1965 and 1993. Dose and volume were obtained from HCL records, and information about patient follow up was derived from concurrent clinical records, questionnaires, and contact with referring physicians. Multivariate logistic regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals was used. Follow up was available in 1250 patients (94%); the median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. The median radiation dose was 10.5 Gy and the median treatment volume was 33.7 cm(3). Twenty-three percent of treated lesions were smaller than 10 cm(3). Fifty-one permanent radiation-related deficits occurred (4.1%). Of 1043 patients treated with a dose predicted by the Kjellberg isoeffective centile curve to have a less than 1% complication risk, 1.8% suffered radiation-related complications. Actual complication rates were 4.7% for 128 patients treated at Kjellberg risk centile doses of 1 to 1.8%, and 34% for 61 patients treated at risk centile doses of 2 to 2.5%. The fitted logistic model showed that complication risk was related to treatment dose and volume, thalamic or brainstem location, and patient age. CONCLUSIONS: The Kjellberg isoeffective risk centile curve significantly underpredicted actual risks of permanent complications after proton beam radiosurgery for AVMs. Actual risks were best predicted using a model that accounted for treatment dose and volume, lesion location, and patient age

DESIGN: A retrospective, nonrandomized comparative study. METHODS: Charts of patients treated with 125I, 106Ru, and PBRT for choroidal melanoma between January 1988 and June 1996 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospitals were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Local control of choroidal melanomas after 125I, 106Ru, or PBRT. RESULTS: A total of 597 patients were identified (125I = 190, 106Ru = 140, PBRT = 267). Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did patients treated with either 125I (P = 0.0133; confidence interval [CI], 1.26-7.02; risk ratio, 2.97) or PBRT (P = 0.0097; CI, 1.30-6.66; risk ratio, 2.94). A stepwise Cox proportional hazard model found maximal basal diameter to be a significant covariate (P = 0.0033). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with 106Ru had a significantly greater risk of local tumor recurrence than did those patients treated with either 125I or PBRT

Less known is the influence of such diagnostic findings on decisions of the therapist. An analysis of this influence might help to compare the value of CT and MRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 104 treated patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx (n = 54) and the paranasal sinuses (n = 50). The study analyzed the influence of CT on primary tumor diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment decision, therapy planning, detection and time of recurrences and retreatment of relapses. RESULTS: Tumors of the nasopharynx: The value of CT for tumor staging was 76% but there was no influence on treatment decision. Radiotherapy planning was influenced in 37% of cases. CT for follow-up was done in 22% of cases. Most relapses occurred within the first 2 years. Paranasal sinus tumors: There was no influence of CT on primary diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor staging was influenced by CT in 94%, treatment decision in 44% and radiotherapy planning in 60%. CT control immediately after therapy was of value in 40%. Most relapses were found within 3 years but some in the 4th and 5th year. Some patients survived 3 to 9 years after retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In tumors of the nasopharynx there is less influence of CT on therapy strategies than diagnostic radiologists might think. No CT is needed for treatment decision since radiotherapy is the only choice of treatment. CT influenced radiotherapy planning however, in about 1/3 of our cases answering sufficiently the 2 main questions: tumor spread into the anterior half of the facial skull or involvement of the base of skull. The retreatment of recurrences detected by CT showed poor results. Late recurrences seem to have better prognosis. We recommend therefore routinely 1 basic CT 6 months after primary treatment followed by 1 CT yearly from the 3rd to 5th year. MRT might offer more diagnostic details than CT. However, at present therapy is not influenced much by this. Since CT is cheaper and faster, MRT could be discussed as additional procedure when CT presents equivocal findings and this fact could be decisive for therapy planning. Paranasal sinus tumors: The influence of CT on tumor-staging and treatment decision is high and convincing. CT helps also at radiotherapy planning and control of tumor response after therapy. CT has high value in detecting recurrences. Retreatment could control disease in some of our patients for 3 to 9 years. Better results could be achieved possibly with earlier diagnosis of recurrence. We propose therefore a basic-CT 6 months after first treatment and 1 CT routinely from the 2nd to 5th year. From the therapist's point of view we recommend CT as first imaging procedure in sinonasal tumors. MRT, more time- and cost consuming, should be applied when CT is equivocal and treatment decision could be influenced

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

The dilemma of whether to treat by primary irradiation or by conservative surgery is not yet solved. In this study, 67 patients were treated between 1967 and 1987 for anterior commissure carcinoma of the larynx. Radiation was used with 47 patients and conservation surgery with 20 patients. Initial lesion control was achieved with 72% of the patients treated by primary irradiation. Conservation surgery, when used as a primary treatment modality, achieved local control in 90% of the patients. The new techniques of reconstruction of the larynx enhance the surgeon's ability, strengthen his conviction to proceed to enlarged partial laryngectomies, and thus improve the oncologic control of the anterior commissure carcinoma as well

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

As of 9/92 a total of 28 patients suffering from peripheral (n = 20) or centrally (n = 8) located soft tissue sarcomas had been were treated. Thirteen patients revealed a primary and 15 patients a recurrent tumor. Tumor resection with negative margins was performed in 20 patients, positive margins remained in 5 patients, and gross macroscopic residual disease in 3 patients. Combined intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy was applied in 22 patients, using IORT doses of 10-20 Gy and an external beam dose of 26-50 Gy. Three patients were irradiated intraoperatively twice with a time interval of 24 h. After a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 20 patients are disease free. Two patients died 4 and 5 months after the end of therapy with rapidly progressive distant metastases. An infield failure within the external beam target volume was seen in 1 patient and local failure at the field margin of the external field in 3 patients. So far, there have been no IORT infield failures. Follow-up is performed with magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 patients a second operation was necessary because of a severe wound infection, including one patient suffering from osteomyelitis of a neighboring bone. Mild sensory neuropathy occurred in 1 patient 7 months after treatment. Overall only mild and reversible postoperative and posttherapeutic complications were seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Mode of action and problems are discussed and published results reported. Human tumour cells obtained of biopsies from our patients before the onset of treatments were investigated. The short time cell cultures were treated either with hyperthermia or irradiation alone or with combinations under the same conditions as the clinical treatments. We could clearly demonstrate that cell cultures of human origin respond to irradiation or hyperthermia. But the effect was limited and only cultures treated with combined modalities did not relapse. There is hope that mega-voltage radiation complemented with hyperthermia have a similar effect as high-LET-radiation. Side effects have been moderate so far using an extended clinical use	
1	132	Treatment of brain tumors in children is associated with abnormal MR spectroscopic ratios in brain tissue remote from the tumor site.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use], Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Humans, Lactic Acid/me [Metabolism], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Radiotherapy, Research	PURPOSE: Children who have brain tumors are at risk for a variety of treatment-related sequelae, including neuropsychological and cognitive impairment, neurologic deficits, and neuroendocrinologic disturbances. We sought to determine the value of proton MR spectroscopy in assessing brain tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child's treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: In children with brain tumors, MR spectroscopy of brain tissue remote from the tumor reveals treatment-related biochemical changes

[Russian]	Adult, Aged, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Ciliary Body, Eye, Female, Glaucoma/et [Etiology], Glaucoma/pc [Prevention & Control], Humans, Iridocyclitis/co [Complications], Iridocyclitis/et [Etiology], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Pupil, Radiation, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The authors have examined the possibility of preventing the development of secondary glaucoma after eye irradiation with a narrow medicinal proton beam. Twenty-eight patients with cilio-choroidal melanoma were involved in the study, 7 male and 21 female ones, aged 48.4 on an average. The authors' findings evidence that postradiation changes in the anterior segment of the eye, resulting from radiation iridocyclitis, are mainly responsible for the development of secondary glaucoma. Preliminary laser-effected formation of iridal coloboma is conducive to a normal flow in the anterior chamber at the expense of an additional pupil functioning and thus helps reduce the possibility of secondary glaucoma development by 1.6 times (or by 38.5%)

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Proton-beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn-Meitner Institute after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved

Given the good level of visual acuity and the location and extent of the damage, he was given a radiotherapy treatment with proton beams. At an interval of 6 months from this treatment, the neoformation appeared limited, and no vascular changes due to irradiation were observed

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 899 patients, who had received the radioactive contrast medium Thorotrast for angiography in the 1930s and 1940s, and 662 controls were followed-up since 1968 every two years by standardized clinical and laboratory examinations. Initially, X-ray plain films of the thorax, upper abdomen and the former injection site were performed. In selected patients the sites of paravascular Thorotrast deposits were evaluated by ultrasonography, CT and MRI. RESULTS: Paravascular Thorotrast deposits were detected in 245 patients. Clinical symptoms related to deposits appeared 10 to 30 years after Thorotrast administration. The severity of symptoms depended on the location and extension of granulomas and were mainly caused by fibrosis, nerve paralysis and vascular changes. Four malignant tumors adjacent to granulomas were observed (one soft tissue sarcoma in the groin, two squamous cell carcinomas of the parotid gland and one lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the nasopharynx). MRI including MRA allowed an accurate determination of tissue damage, whereas the utility of US and CT was restricted due to strong sound attenuation and streak artefacts caused by the high X-ray absorption of Thorotrast. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Locoregional late effects of paravascular Thorotrast deposits mainly comprise radiation induced, fibrotic tissue destruction. The incidence of malignant tumors, in particular sarcomas, adjacent to deposits, however, is much lower than initially expected

Failure to control the primary tumor has been the most common cause for death. Our experience in three patients with small squamous cell cancer of the trachea treated by definitive irradiation is encouraging. The primary tumor was controlled in each patient. Histologic confirmation of tumor sterilization was observed in two. One patient remains alive and well at 54 months; one patient developed an epidural metastases at 16 months and subsequently died; and the third patient developed a separate primary lung cancer at 48 months. Two patients developed significant radiation complications

These tumors are believed to behave more aggressively than chordomas in adults and may have unusual morphology. This study examines a large series of pediatric skull base chordomas treated with a standardized protocol to characterize the behavior and morphology of these tumors. There were 31 males and 42 females ranging from 1 to 18 (mean 9.7) years. Forty-two cases (58%) were conventional chordomas, some of which had unusual histopathologic features. Chondroid chordomas comprised 23% of cases. Fourteen tumors (19%) were highly cellular and had a solid growth pattern with no myxoid matrix or lobular architecture. Eight of these had cytologic features of conventional chordoma cells including physaliferous cells (cellular chordoma). The remaining cellular tumors were composed of poorly differentiated epithelioid cells set in a fibrous stroma and lacked physaliferous cells (poorly differentiated chordoma). All variants studied by immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein, and vimentin. Mitoses and necrosis were seen in all variants. Follow-up data were available for all patients and ranged from 1 to 21 (mean 7.25) years. The survival rate was 81%. All but 1 patient with poorly differentiated chordoma died of disease. Overall, base of skull chordomas in children and adolescents treated with proton beam radiation have better survival than chordomas in adults. However, poorly differentiated chordomas are highly aggressive tumors

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma. Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation. The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed

This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In June 1999, the Society ordered an analysis of the state of radiation oncology. It created a survey that was sent to all radiotherapy units in Spain. A database was created in which 230 variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-four centers were analyzed, and 157 external beam irradiation, megavoltage units were counted, of which 67 were cobalt units and 90 were linear accelerators. The cobalt units worked an average of 11.4 h daily and the linear accelerators 11.6 h. The number of patients/unit/y was 472 for the cobalt units and 442 for the linear accelerators. The number of patients by physician and year was 179. Each center received a mean of 958 new patients annually. The average between the reception and start of treatment was 25.52 days (maximum 60), and it was estimated that only 38.1% of cancers were irradiated. The number of radiation oncologists working was 392. Spain has a deficit of 297 radiation oncologists. CONCLUSION: There is a need for 44 MV units and for the replacement of 67 cobalt units. The present lack of units has had an impact on palliative treatment, which has resulted in pharmacy costs. As long as these instrumental deficiencies are not solved, waiting lists will continue to be inherent to the system. There are also important staff deficiencies, in that about 297 radiation oncologists would be needed to cover the needs

Symptomatic epilepsy was present in 29 patients (22.5%) before the treatment. It was markedly relieved by the radiosurgery leading to cessation of the seizures in 16 patients, the persisting seizure-free follow-up period ranging from 2 to 8 years (mean 4.5 years). In no case was the epilepsy worsened by radiosurgery. The positive effect on epilepsy was not strictly dependent on the angiographic result, suggesting that the ionizing radiation by itself could lead to inhibition of epileptic activity around the AVM

To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic techniques of carbon ion therapy have been established for patients with prostate cancer. Carbon ion therapy may exert excellent effect to the tissues of prostate cancer.

Of 37, 34 were operated on. Three were considered inoperable and were treated with radiotherapy (including proton beam). Of the 34 operated (30 AVM), 31 (24 AVM) were totally removed. None of them died or exhibitied deterioration. Of the 3 partially operated cases, one improved, two remained unchanged, but one of the two died of rebleeding 3 months later. Two of the radiated cases were later severely incapacitated due to rebleeding. One that underwent proton therapy is still under observation without deterioration after 18 months

The purpose of our study was to define parameters from single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy that provide a probability measure for differentiating neoplastic from radiation-induced, nonneoplastic lesions. METHODS: Seventy-two lesions in 56 patients were examined using a combined MR imaging and MR spectroscopy protocol (point-resolved spectroscopy, TE = 135 ms). Signal intensities of cholines, creatines, N-acetyl aspartate, and the presence of lactate and lipid resonances were correlated to final diagnoses established by clinical and MR imaging follow-up, positron emission tomography studies, or biopsy/surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test, linear discriminant analysis, and k nearest-neighbor method. RESULTS: Significantly increased signal intensity ratios I(tCho)/I(tCr) (P <.0001) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) (P <.0001) were observed in neoplastic (n = 34) compared with nonneoplastic lesions (n = 32) and contralateral normal brain (n = 33). Analysis of I(tCho)/I(tCr) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) data yielded correct retrospective classification as neoplastic and nonneoplastic in 82% and 81% of the lesions, respectively. Neither I(NAA)/I(tCr) nor signal intensitities of lactate or lipids were useful for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Metabolic information provided by proton MR spectroscopy is useful for the differentiation of neoplastic and nonneoplastic brain lesions after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

METHODS: A retrospective chart and film review was performed for all patients treated for medulloblastoma at the Insitute for Neurology and Neurosurgery/Beth Israel Medical Center between August 1996 and the present. The clinical and radiographic histories of pediatric patients (ages 3-21 years at diagnosis) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma who received craniospinal radiation therapy were reviewed. Fifty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age at radiation treatment of 7.7 years and a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years. The dose to the craniospinal axis was 24 Gy (31 patients) or 36 Gy (28 patients). The radiation energy in the craniospinal axis was provided by photons in 55 patients and protons in four. All patients received a posterior fossa boost of 54 Gy (46 patients) or 72 Gy (13 patients). Twenty-six lesions developed in 18 patients (31%) during the observation period. The cumulative incidence of lesion development was 5.6, 14, and 43%, at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The sites of occurrence were cerebral (20 cases) and cerebellar (six cases). There was no significant correlation between age at diagnosis, sex, craniospinal radiation dose or energy source, and lesion development. Only one patient required surgical intervention for a symptomatic hemorrhagic lesion in the frontal lobe. Histological analysis in this case was consistent with cavernoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cavernomas are common after cranial irradiation in children, and their incidence increases over time. Most of these lesions follow a benign course and do not require intervention

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases

METHODS AND MATERIALS : Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p < 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients

Post mortem two tumours were found in an enlarged liver: a cholangiocarcinoma and an angiosarcoma. Coincidentally, a hilar neurofibroma was found. The former two tumours most probably developed because of a lifelong endogenous alpha-irradiation by thorium disintegration. The exceptional latency period of 60 years' duration is emphasized

After a 2 to 4 year follow-up, primary cancer was found to be controlled in 59 patients, a recurrence was noted in 16 patients but 12 patients had died without precise information concerning recurrence. We examined the correlation between recurrence and seven prognostic factors. Among these factors, the tumor volume, age, and the red blood corpuscle sedimentation rate showed a relatively strong correlation. A multivariable analysis (quantification methods II) was undertaken in order to integrate these prognostic factors and the score that was calculated from this analysis showed a strong correlation to local control. We believe that this score can be used for predicting recurrences and can be applied to the selection of patients for new treatments like hyperthermia or high LET irradiation

On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

The significance of this effect for cancer risk assessment and radiotherapy treatment planning requires demonstration of its relevance in vivo. The problem in demonstrating the existence of the effect in vivo is that other systemic effects may mask or confound the effect being investigated and it is practically impossible to attribute an effect in a particular cell to a signal produced in another irradiated cell. To approach this problem, an assay has been developed where fragments of human tissue can be irradiated ex vivo and the media harvested and added to unirradiated, clonogenic cells which have a well characterised and stable response to the bystander signal. The variation in the production of a signal from patient to patient can thus be assessed. The results of a study using tissue from over 100 patients attending Beaumont and St Vincent's Hospitals in Dublin for investigation of urological disorders including follow-up after treatment for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and resection of suspect prostatic lesions, are now available. Blood samples from the prostate group were also obtained. The results show that there is variation in the effect of the signal produced by irradiated tissue from different patients. This holds for bladder, prostate and blood. Gender, smoking status and the existence of a malignancy influence the expression of the signal by normal tissue. Male gender, smoking and a pre-existing malignancy all reduce the amount or effect of the signal produced into medium when the tissue is exposed. The effects of exposure to medium containing the signal are transmitted to distant progeny of the exposed cell population. The results may be important not only for understanding radiation risk mechanisms for protection but also for radiotherapy treatment planning where they may open new avenues for development of drugs for combined therapy

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic techniques of carbon ion therapy have been established for patients with prostate cancer. Carbon ion therapy may exert excellent effect to the tissues of prostate cancer.

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

METHODS: With ERB approval, we recorded anaesthesia monitoring data in children undergoing repeated prolonged propofol sedation for PRT. Sedation was introduced with a single bolus of i.v. midazolam 0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by repeated small boluses of propofol until sufficient depth of sedation was obtained. Sedation was maintained with fixed dose rate propofol infusion of 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in all patients up to the end of the radiation procedure. Patient characteristics, number and duration of sedation, propofol induction dose, necessity to alter propofol infusion rate, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate were noted at the end of the radiation procedure before cessation of the propofol infusion. Data are mean (sd) or range (median) as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighteen children aged from 1.4 to 4.2 yr (2.6 yr) had 27.6 (sd 2.0) (497 in total) radiation procedures within 44.1 (4.0) days lasting 55.7 (8.8) min. Propofol bolus dose for induction, monitoring, and positioning was 3.7 (1.0) mg kg(-1). Propofol bolus requirements were quite stable over the successive weeks of treatment and variability was larger between individuals than over time. In none of the children did propofol infusion rate need to be changed from the pre-set 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) flow rate because of haemodynamic state, respiratory conditions or inadequate anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated prolonged deep sedation over several weeks in very young children using a fixed rate propofol infusion was safe and adequate for all patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation	
0	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option	
0	248	A treatment planning comparison of combined photon-proton beams versus proton beams-only for the treatment of skull base tumors	Algorithms, Brain Stem/re [Radiation Effects], Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye/re [Radiation Effects], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Optic Chiasm/re [Radiation Effects], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Tumor Burden	PURPOSE: To compare treatment planning between combined photon-proton planning (CP) and proton planning (PP) for skull base tumors, so as to assess the potential limitations of CP for these tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August 1998 and December 2000, 37 patients with chordomas (n = 24) and chondrosarcomas (n = 13) were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy within a Phase I/II trial. Tumor conformal application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included biologic plan optimization. The median tumor dose was 60 GyE (GyE = Gy x relative biologic effectiveness). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 13 months. The local control rate after 1 and 2 years was 96% and 90%, respectively. We observed 2 recurrences outside the gross tumor volume in patients with chordomas. Progression-free survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 83% for chordomas at 2 years. Partial remission after carbon ion radiotherapy was observed in 6 patients. Treatment toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: These are the first data demonstrating the clinical feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of scanning beam delivery of ion beams in patients with skull base tumors. The preliminary results in patients with skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas are encouraging, although the follow-up was too short to draw definite conclusions concerning outcome. In the absence of major toxicity, dose escalation might be considered	
1	4729	Results of surgical resection for progression of brain metastases previously treated by gamma knife radiosurgery	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cohort Studies, Disease Progression, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/du [Diagnostic Use], Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neurosurgical Procedures, Neurosurgical Procedures/ae [Adverse Effects], Patients, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Reoperation, Research, Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Universities	OBJECTIVE: To determine treatment outcome after surgical resection for progressive brain metastases after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) and to explore the role of dynamic contrast agent-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton spectroscopic MRI studies (MRS/P) in predicting pathological findings. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 32 patients underwent surgical resection for suspected progression of brain metastases from a cohort of 245 patients with brain metastases treated with GKR. Postradiosurgery MRI surveillance was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after GKR. In some cases, additional MRI scanning with spectroscopy or perfusion (MRS/P) was used to aid differentiation of radiation change from tumor progression. The decision to perform neurosurgical resection was based on MRI or clinical evidence of lesion progression among patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more and absent or stable systemic disease. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (32 out of 245) of patients and 6% (38 out of 611) of lesions required surgical resection after GKR. The median time from GKR to surgical resection was 8.6 months (range, 1.7-27.1 mo). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival from time of GKR was 97, 78, and 47% for the resected patients and 65, 40, and 19% for the nonresected patients (P < 0.0001). The two-year survival rate of patients requiring two resections after GKR was 100% compared with 39% for patients undergoing one resection (P = 0.02). The median survival of resected patients was 27.2 months (range, 7.0-72.5 mo) from the diagnosis of brain metastases, 19.9 months (range, 5.0-60.7 mo) from GKR, and 8.9 months (range, 0.2-53.1 mo) from surgical resection. Tumor was found in 90% of resected specimens and necrosis alone in 10%. MRS/P studies were performed in 15 resected patients. Overall, MRS/P predicted tumor in 11 lesions, confirmed pathologically in nine lesions, and necrosis alone was found in two. The MRS/P predicted necrosis alone in three, whereas pathology revealed viable tumor in two and necrosis in one lesion. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of progressive brain metastases after GKR in selected patients leads to a meaningful improvement in survival rates. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MRS/P in the postradiosurgery surveillance of brain metastases

Results of a prospective study incorporating chemotherapy, surgery, and combined proton-photon radiotherapy	Adult, Aged, Boston, Cisplatin/ad [Administration & Dosage], Combined Modality Therapy, Drug Therapy,Combination, Etoposide/ad [Administration & Dosage], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neuroendocrine Tumors/th [Therapy], Nose Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Prognosis, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Salvage Therapy, Survival, Survival Rate, Time	BACKGROUND: The authors report the results of a prospective study of patients with malignant neuroendocrine tumors of the sinonasal tract who received multimodality treatment incorporating high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy. METHODS: Nineteen patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) were treated between 1992 and 1998 on a prospective study. Four patients had Kadish Stage B disease, and 15 patients had Kadish Stage C disease. The median patient age was 44 years. Patients received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin and etoposide followed by high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy to 69.2 cobalt-Gray equivalents (CGE) using 1.6-1.8 CGE per fraction twice daily in a concomitant boost schedule. Two further courses of chemotherapy were given to responders. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, 15 patients were alive at the time of this report with a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 20-92 months). Four patients died from disseminated disease 8-47 months after their original diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was 74%. There were two local recurrences, and both patients underwent salvage surgery. The 5-year local control rate of initial treatment was 88%. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was tolerable, with no patient sustaining more than Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients showed a partial or complete response to chemotherapy. One patient developed unilateral visual loss after the first course of chemotherapy; otherwise, visual preservation was achieved in all patients. Four patients who were clinically intact developed radiation-induced damage to the frontal or temporal lobe by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Two patients showed soft tissue and/or bone necrosis, and one of these patients required surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and high-dose proton-photon radiotherapy is a successful treatment approach for patients with ONB and NEC. Radical surgery is reserved for nonresponders. Due to the precision of delivery of radiation with stereotactic setup and protons, no radiation-induced visual loss was observed	
0	1791	Use of high-frequency ultrasound imaging to improve delineation of anterior uveal melanoma for proton irradiation	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biophysics, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Ciliary Body, Female, Humans, Iris Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Iris Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Light, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sclera, Software, Sutures, Tantalum, Transillumination, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Uveal Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography]	The aim of this study was to evaluate high-frequency ultrasound imaging (HFUI) as an aid in localizing anterior margins of tumours of the eye for proton therapy. Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

The advent of localized proton spectroscopy has made this detection possible. The spectral peak intensities were found to be very different depending on tumor tissue pathology. METHODS: The tumor cell reaction after radiation therapy was examined with proton localized spectroscopy in addition to enhanced MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips, Gyroscan S15-HP). Plain MR images (short spin echo) were used for localization pilot images, and after the MRS study, contrast enhanced MRI was carried out. Studies were performed pre-radiation, mid-radiation, and post-radiation if possible. MATERIALS: Sixteen patients (total 27 examinations) with intracranial tumors and three normal volunteers underwent proton NMR localized spectroscopy. The brain tumors were diagnosed before the MR study, and nine patients had metastatic brain tumors, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, and seven other patients were diagnosed with glioma-type tumors. RESULTS: The reaction patterns of proton NMR spectroscopy of brain tumors after radiation therapy were very different and depended on tumor histology. CONCLUSION: Proton NMR spectroscopy is an excellent means of determining tumor cell viability

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome	
0	2176	Novel solutions to the problems encountered in electron irradiation to the surface of the head	Adult, Facial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Head, Humans, Lithium, Male, Middle Aged, Mycosis Fungoides/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiometry, Scalp, Skin, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	A novel treatment for two patients with mycosis fungoides involving all or most of the skin surface of the head is described using large overlapping low energy electron beams. Shielding of previously treated and uninvolved areas was achieved by encapsulating cerrobend within a thermoplastic shell in one patient. In the other patient, GE Saturnes unique asymmetric electron field definition facility was used. Satisfactory dose uniformity was demonstrated by the computation of dose distributions on the full summed electron pencil beam model on the Target Series 2 treatment planning system. Verification of the calculated dose homogeneity was confirmed with lithium fluoride (TLD-100) thermoluminescent dosimetry. The relatively simple treatment set-up was accomplished easily on a routine basis and was well tolerated by the patients, both of whom have been in complete remission since their treatment	
1	4221	Definitive radiotherapy of prostatic cancer: the Norwegian Radium Hospital's experience (1976-1982)	Aged, Gastrointestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Humans, Incidence, Male, Medical Oncology, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Prognosis, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radium, Research, Survival, Urologic Diseases/et [Etiology]	During the years 1976 to 1982 definitive curatively aimed radiotherapy to the primary tumor was given to 53 patients with prostatic cancer confined to the true pelvis (T0, 2; T1-2, 19; T3, 24; T4, 8; N0, 18; N+, 2; Nx, 33); all patients were of the Mo-category. The pelvic lymph nodes received a total dose of 2 Gy X 25 by means of an anterior and posterior radiation field. The prostatic gland was irradiated by an additional booster dose of 2 Gy X 10 given to a perineal field. Twenty-four patients have relapsed after their prostatic radiotherapy, only three of them within the irradiated area. For the patients with T0-T2 tumors, the 5-year crude survival was 69%, whereas it was only 37% for patients with T3 tumors. Thirty-five patients developed intestinal (26 patients) and/or urogenital (23 patients) radiation side effects. In three patients a colostomy had to be performed owing to rectal stricture or fistula. The poor survival after radiotherapy in the present series is probably due to a high incidence of unrecognized pelvic lymph node metastases. In the future only prostatic cancer patients without pelvic lymph node spread will be considered candidates for definitive radiotherapy. An optimal radiation technique is mandatory in order to avoid major radiotherapy-induced toxicity

The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy	
1	340	The impact of dose escalation on secondary cancer risk after radiotherapy of prostate cancer	Computer Simulation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Models,Biological, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Photons, Physics, Probability, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostatic Neoplasms/co [Complications], Prostatic Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Risk, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To estimate secondary cancer risk due to dose escalation in patients treated for prostatic carcinoma with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and spot-scanned proton RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential, a plateau, and a linear dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 23 patients who received RT of prostate cancer. Conformal RT was used in 7 patients, 8 patients received IMRT with 6- and 15-MV photons, and 8 patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. We applied target doses ranging from 70 Gy to 100 Gy. Cancer risk was estimated as a function of target dose and tumor control probability. RESULTS: At a 100-Gy target dose the secondary cancer risk relative to the 3D treatment plan at 70 Gy was +18.4% (15.0% for a plateau model, 22.3% for a linear model) for the 6-MV IMRT plan, +25.3% (17.0%, 14.1%) for the 15-MV IMRT plan, and -40.7% (-41.3%, -40.0%) for the spot-scanned protons. The increasing risk of developing a radiation-associated malignancy after RT with increasing dose was balanced by the enhanced cure rates at a larger dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk after dose escalation for prostate RT is expected to be equal to or lower than for conventional 3D treatment at 70 Gy, independent of treatment modality or dose-response model. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice for dose escalation because this therapy can halve the risk of secondary cancers

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic techniques of carbon ion therapy have been established for patients with prostate cancer. Carbon ion therapy may exert excellent effect to the tissues of prostate cancer.

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect	
0	189	Transient metabolic changes observed with proton MR spectroscopy in normal human brain after radiation therapy	Adult, Aspartic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Aspartic Acid/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/me [Metabolism], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/me [Metabolism], Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Choline/me [Metabolism], Creatine/me [Metabolism], Female, Humans, Lactic Acid/me [Metabolism], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Injuries/me [Metabolism], Radiotherapy, Research	PURPOSE: To observe the time course of the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) variations due to radiation therapy on normal human brain. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

This last decade has seen a rapid proliferation in the development of the methodology which is certainly related in part to the simultaneous growth of high-resolution neuro-imaging techniques. By focusing the beams of 201 hemispherically arrayed cobalt 60 sources, the gamma-knife delivers a high dose of radiation to a small target. Another possibility proposed by several authors is the bragg peak cyclotron-generated irradiation with accelerated protons or helium ions. In Lille, since 1988, we have chosen to develop stereotactic radiosurgery, according to the system of Betti, by the association of Talairach's stereotactic methodology and external single-dose encephalic irradiation with high energy X-rays, delivered by means of a linear accelerator. The major indication for the use of this method is an arteriovenous malformation. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be proposed alone or in combination with surgery and embolisation. It has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment and an attractive alternative in carefully selected patients with intracranial tumours: slow-growing, well limited, deep-seated tumours, such as some gliomas, acoustic neurinomas, skull base meningiomas, pituitary adenomas. This treatment is also used to deliver a focal boost of radiation to previously administered fractionated radiotherapy in patients with small gliomas and solitary brain metastases	
0	1140	Treatment planning comparison of conventional, 3D conformal, and intensity-modulated photon (IMRT) and proton therapy for paranasal sinus carcinoma	Austria, Humans, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinuses/ra [Radiography], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Planning Techniques, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To determine the potential improvements in patients with paranasal sinus carcinoma by comparing proton and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with conventional and conformal photon treatment planning techniques. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients were randomized to pion therapy (33-34.5 Gy pi), or conventional photon irradiation (60 Gy). Entry criteria included astrocytoma (modified Kernohan high Grade 3 or Grade 4), age 18-70, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or = 50, ability to start irradiation within 30 days of surgery, unifocal tumor, and treatment volume < 850 cc. The high-dose volume in both arms was computed tomography enhancement plus a 2-cm margin. The study was designed with the power to detect a twofold difference between arms. RESULTS: Eighty-one eligible patients were equally balanced for all known prognostic variables. Pion patients started radiation 7 days earlier on average than photon patients, but other treatment-related variables did not differ. There were no significant differences for either early or late radiation toxicity between treatment arms. Actuarial survival analysis shows no differences in terms of time to local recurrence or overall survival where median survival was 10 months in both arms (p = 0.22). The physician-assessed KPS and patient-assessed quality of life (QOL) measurements were generally maintained within 10 percentage points until shortly before tumor recurrence. There was no apparent difference in the serial KPS or QOL scores between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: In contrast to high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy for central nervous system tumors, such as neutron or neon therapy, the safety of pion therapy, which is of intermediate LET, has been reaffirmed. However, this study has demonstrated no therapeutic gain for pion therapy of glioblastoma

Angiography showed a small left pontine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with a small aneurysm on the pedicle feeding the AVM. The pedicle aneurysm was occluded by microcoils. The AVM was then treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up angiography 2 years later revealed that the AVM had disappeared completely without neurological deficit. The combination of embolization and proton-beam radiosurgery was curative in this patient with a pontine AVM associated with an aneurysm on the feeding artery, showing that these techniques can be used to treat inoperable vascular lesions safely	
0	4220	Clinical value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for differentiating recurrent or residual brain tumor from delayed cerebral necrosis	Adolescent, Biopsy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Diagnostic Imaging, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm,Residual, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity	PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral necrosis (DN) is a significant risk for brain tumor patients treated with high-dose irradiation. Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

0	4713	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry of the head and neck: a comparison of treatment plans using linear accelerator-based IMRT and helical tomotherapy	Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Methods, Neck, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Gland, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography,Spiral Computed/mt [Methods], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	PURPOSE: To date, most intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery has occurred using linear accelerators (linacs), although helical tomotherapy has become commercially available. To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

Helium ion treatment of tumors adjacent to critical central nervous system structures	Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Ions, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In this paper we present a technique for treating relatively small, low grade tumors located very close to critical, radiation sensitive central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain stem. A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors

[French]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Chordoma/di [Diagnosis], Chordoma/th [Therapy], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Head and Neck Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Head and Neck Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Pain, Prognosis, Protons	Chordomas are rare neoplasms of notochordal origin that arise along the vertebral axis. In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

There is no established treatment plan for the disease, which may be attributed to its rarity and aggressiveness. Surgery is the choice of treatment in early cases. Radiotherapy follows surgery, and chemotherapy has an insignificant role in its treatment. Radiation with heavy ion beams is showing promising results in cancer therapy. Compared to conventional radiation, it permits selective irradiation with minimal injury to the surrounding normal tissue, and treatment with a low dose within a short interval of time is possible. We herein report a case of PMME treated with heavy ion radiation, the first case to be reported so far, and review the relevant literature

This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc	
0	1585	Pedicled rhinotomy for clival chordomas invaginating the brainstem	Adult, California, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Dura Mater/pa [Pathology], Dura Mater/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasal Cavity/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Invasiveness, Nose, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Rotation, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: Clival chordomas are frequently midline lesions whose posterior growth may breach the dura and invaginate the brainstem. This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

The external therapy with telecobalt or by an 18 MeV betatron was dosed from 3000 to 4000 rads. Most of the patients received an additional single intraperitoneal application of 150 mCi gold-198. The five-year survival rate of all patients was 45%, whereas it was 71% for stage I, 47% for stage II, 21% for stage III, and 4% for stage IV. In 3% out of all cases, surgical procedure was necessary because of complications. Today, an indication for intraperitoneal therapy by radioactive isotopes is only adopted in case of a ruptured malignant ovarian tumor

Both therapy modes were used in the therapy of 62 patients with tumors of the kidneys, 13 patients with tumors of the esophagus, 20 patients with tumors of the prostate and urinary bladder and 170 patients with tumors of the breast. The advantage of the described method is the possibility of simple, precise and easily reproducible irradiation in given localizations, good therapeutic effect and very good general tolerance as the patient concerns

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity

We havefound it necessary to 1) obtain an accurate three-dimensional determination of the treatment volume including the density of all tissues in the beam path; 2) construct an adequate bolus to compensate for tissue heterogeneities; 3) use much more precise and accurate immobilization and patient positioning devices than used in photon irradiation; 4) treat with both protons and photons so as to keep the skin dose within an acceptable level. IN TISSUES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT INHOMOGENETIES DUE TO BONE AND AIR SPACES WE HAVE DELIVEREDA WELL-DEFINED DOSE TO INVOLVED TISSUES WHILE SPARING DISTAL SENSITIVE STRUCTURES. However, in those regions where there is much "fine structure" of tissue density, it has been difficult to compensate satisfactorily for the inhomogeneties	
1	3183	Helium charged particle radiotherapy for meningioma: experience at UCLBL. University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory	Adult, Aged, California, Californium, Female, Helium, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skull, Skull Base, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	PURPOSE: Evaluate the use of helium charged particle radiotherapy in the treatment of residual or unresectable meningioma adjacent to critical structures. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with meningioma of the skull base or spine were irradiated with helium charged particle radiotherapy at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (UCLBL) during the period 1981-1992. Twenty-six patients were treated for intracranial and three for spinal tumors. Total doses of 53.0-80.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) with a mean of 63 GyE were delivered using the helium ion beam. RESULTS: Ten-year local control and survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method were 84% and 80% respectively. Doses of 60.0 GyE were delivered with a low rate of complications. The only failures were in massive, recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: High doses using helium charged particle radiotherapy can be safely and effectively delivered to large residual or unresectable meningioma near radiosensitive structures

Helium ion treatment of tumors adjacent to critical central nervous system structures	Aged, Brain, Brain Stem, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Ions, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In this paper we present a technique for treating relatively small, low grade tumors located very close to critical, radiation sensitive central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain stem. A beam of helium ions is used to irradiate the tumor. The nearby normal tissues are protected by exploiting the superb dose localization properties of this beam, particularly its well defined and controllable range in tissue, the increased dose deposited near the end of this range (i.e., the Bragg peak), the sharp decrease in dose beyond the Bragg peak, and the sharp penumbra of the beam. To execute this type of treatment, extreme care must be taken in localization of the tumor and normal tissues, as well as in treatment planning and dosimetry, patient immobilization, and verification of treatment delivery. To illustrate the technique, we present a group of 19 patients treated for chordomas, meningiomas and low grade chondrosarcomas in the base of the skull or spinal column. We have been able to deliver high, uniform doses to the target volumes (doses equivalent to 60 to 80 Gy of cobalt-60) while keeping the doses to the nearby critical tissues below the threshold for radiation damage. Follow-up on this group of patients is short, averaging 22 months (2 to 75 months). Currently, 15 patients have local control of their tumor. Two major complications, a spinal cord transection and optic tract damage, are discussed in detail. Our treatment policies have been modified to minimize the risk of these complications in the future, and we are continuing to use this method to treat such patients. We are enthusiastic about this technique, since we believe there is no other potentially curative treatment for these patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support continued investigation to confirm therapeutic efficacy

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons	
0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bile duct carcinomas are notoriously difficult to cure, with locoregional recurrence the rule, even after radical resection. Adjuvant efforts have included various radiation modalities, with limited success. Recently, charged-particle radiotherapy has also been used in these patients. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis of 129 patients with bile duct adenocarcinomas treated between 1977 and 1987 through the University of California at San Francisco, including 22 patients treated at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with the charged particles helium and neon. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Survival, outcome, and complication results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were treated with surgery alone (S), 45 patients received conventional adjuvant x-ray radiotherapy (S + X), and 22 were treated with charged particles (S + CP). The median survival times were 6.5, 11, and 14 months, respectively, for the entire group, and 16, 16, and 23 months in patients treated with curative intent. There was a survival difference in patients undergoing total resection compared with debulking (p = 0.05) and minor resections (p = 0.0001). Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant irradiation, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional X (p = 0.0109). Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after irradiatio CONCLUSIONS: The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Monte Carlo calculations were performed to evaluate the pencil-beam algorithm in patient geometries for a modulated 150-MeV proton beam. A modified version of a Monte Carlo code described in a previous publication (18) was used for these comparisons. Tissue densities were inferred from patient CT data on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and calculations were performed with and without tissue compensators. A dose calculation module using the new algorithm was written, and treatment plans using the new algorithm were compared to plans using standard ray-tracing techniques for 10 patients with clival chordoma and three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with helium lons at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL). RESULTS: Pencil beam calculations agreed well with Monte Carlo calculations in the patient geometries. The pencil-beam algorithm predicted several multiple-scattering effects that are not modeled by conventional ray-tracing calculations. These include (a) the widening of the penumbra as a function of beam penetration, (b) the degradation in the sharpness of the dose gradient at the end of the particle range in highly heterogeneous regions, and (c) the appearance of hot and cold dose regions in the shadow of complex heterogeneities. In particular, pencil-beam calculations indicated that the dose distribution within the target was not as homogeneous as expected on the basis of ray-tracing calculations. On average, for the 13 patients considered, only about 72% of the conedown target volume received at least 99% of the prescribed dose, whereas, 93% of the conedown volume was contained within the 95% isodose surface. This may be significant because in standard charged particle dose calculations, the dose across the spread-Bragg peak is assumed to be uniform and equal to the maximum or prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Dose distributions computed with the pencil-beam model are more accurate than ray-tracing calculations, providing additional information to clinicians, which may influence the doses they prescribe. In particular, these calculations indicate that for some patients with skull-base tumors, it may be advantageous to prescribe proton doses to a lower isodose level than is commonly done

Every part of the body including oral cavity is affected by these lesions. According to modern acknowledgement in treating oropharynge carcinoma, radiotherapy is used for management of oral Kaposi's sarcoma. This paper reports a study of 10 patients suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma correlated to AIDS (EKS) treated with radiotherapy and chemiotherapy, achieving good results, at the Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori of Milan (Divisone di Radioterapia C) from 1988 to 1992. Treatment has been performed using linear accelerator (6 Mev) or Co 60 unity in order to reach the deepest layer of mucosa lesions. Radiotherapy schedule consisted of 150-200 cGy daily fractions given 5 times/week (w) for 4-5 w in split-course. [References: 62]

Despite this aggressive strategy, there are few long-term survivors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging method that can monitor metabolic changes in brain tumours. To date there is little data concerning the prognostic significance of the evolving spectral alterations during a course of radiotherapy. MATERIALS: We report herein a prospective study of patients with HGGs undergoing post-operative radiotherapy. Fourteen consecutively eligible patients with a confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant glioma and completion of all required MRS imaging were included in this study. All patients had MRS imaging prior to radiotherapy, at week 4 of radiotherapy, and 2 months post-treatment. T1 and T2 weighted images as well as post-gadolinium multi-voxel proton MRS images were obtained. Normalized (tumour metabolite/normal brain metabolite) levels of choline, NAA, creatine, lipid and lactate were calculated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of progression-free and overall survival were constructed based on the evolving patterns of metabolite changes over the course of the images. RESULTS: The mean tumour choline/NAA ratio decreased over the course of therapy, with a reduction observed between the baseline and post-radiotherapy studies (1.91 vs. 1.29, P=0.049). A similar decrease was identified with the mean normalized choline ratio, with a highly significant difference observed between the baseline and post-radiation images (1.61 vs. 0.96, P=0.001). Patients who exhibited more than 40% decrease in normalized choline between the week 4 and post-radiotherapy studies were associated with unfavourable survival (logrank test, P=0.003) and disease progression (logrank test, P=0.012). The Lactate/NAA ratio at the 4th week of radiotherapy and the change in normalized choline/creatine between baseline and week 4 of radiotherapy were also predictive of outcome suggesting the possibility of adaptive, response-based radiation treatment. Patients with two or more poor prognostic MRS indices had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with zero or one poor indices, with 15% and 68% at 1 year, respectively (logrank test, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The evolving pattern of spectral changes over the course of radiotherapy, in particular those associated with choline-containing compounds, appears to be prognostic of tumour response and outcome. Based on our data, a decision point may exist in the mid course of radical radiotherapy, at which time consideration of the choline levels could indicate the extent of radiotherapeutic response, thus allowing for individualized treatment modification

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity

A limited institutional pilot study was therefore done by the Southwest Oncology Group between October 1977, and November 1978 to test the benefit of this program in previously untreated persons with Stages 3 and 4 diffuse histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eleven evaluable patients with the following histologies were treated: 7 poorly differentiated, 2 with histiocytic, 1 with mixed lymphoma and 1 with well-differentiated morphology. CHOP was given in the following manner: cyclophosphamide 400 mg/M2 IV day 1, adriamycin 40 mg/M2 IV day 1, vincristine 2 mg IV day 1, and Prednisone 100 mg po daily X 5. Forty-five rad total body irradiation was delivered in three fractions on days 21, 23 and 25. Chemotherapy was repeated on day 42, etc., until four cycles of CHOP and three cycles TBI (135R) were delivered. Responses were seen in 8/11 patients (6 CR and 2 PR); 5 persons are currently alive and 6 are dead. Two of the living patients are alive with disease and the remainder are in unmaintained remission. Two persons died with no response and one died in complete remission of an unrelated illness. The median duration of remission is 15 months and the median survival for all patients is 48 months. The therapy was well tolerated with a mean nadir leukocyte count of 3,020 X 10(9)/microliters (range 1.2-5.5) and a mean nadir platelet count of 188 X 10(9)/microliters (range 016-270). As delivered, this program is capable of producing durable remissions and needs to be verified in a larger series of patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August 1998 and December 2000, 37 patients with chordomas (n = 24) and chondrosarcomas (n = 13) were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy within a Phase I/II trial. Tumor conformal application of carbon ion beams was realized by intensity-controlled raster scanning with pulse-to-pulse energy variation. Three-dimensional treatment planning included biologic plan optimization. The median tumor dose was 60 GyE (GyE = Gy x relative biologic effectiveness). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 13 months. The local control rate after 1 and 2 years was 96% and 90%, respectively. We observed 2 recurrences outside the gross tumor volume in patients with chordomas. Progression-free survival was 100% for chondrosarcomas and 83% for chordomas at 2 years. Partial remission after carbon ion radiotherapy was observed in 6 patients. Treatment toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: These are the first data demonstrating the clinical feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of scanning beam delivery of ion beams in patients with skull base tumors. The preliminary results in patients with skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas are encouraging, although the follow-up was too short to draw definite conclusions concerning outcome. In the absence of major toxicity, dose escalation might be considered	
0	1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

The new model was verified by comparing measured and calculated wedge factors for the standard set of wedge angles (i.e., 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees), different symmetric and asymmetric fields, and two different photon energies. The maximum difference between calculated and measured wedge factors is less than 2%. The average absolute difference is within 1%. The obtained results indicate that the suggested model can be useful for independent dose calculation with enhanced dynamic wedges

Threshold values to indicate the probability of a progressive tumor were also calculated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with histologically proven gliomas showing a suspicious brain lesion in MRI after stereotactic radiotherapy were evaluated on a 1.5 Tesla unit (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using 2D proton MRSI (repetition time/echo time = 1500/135 msec, PRESS; voxel size 9 x 9 x 15 mm (3)). A total of 274 spectra were analyzed (92 voxel were localized within the suspicious brain lesion). Relative signal intensities Cho, Cr and NAA were measured and their ability to discern between PT and nPT was assessed using the linear discrimination method, logistic regression, and the cross-validation method. PT and nPT were differentiated between on the basis of clinical course and follow-up by MRI, CT and positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The Cho parameter and the relative signal intensity ratios of Cr and NAA were most effective in differentiating between PT and nPT. The logistic regression method using the parameter ln(Cho/Cr) and ln(Cho/NAA) had the best predictive results in cross-validation. A sensitivity of 93.8 % and specificity of 85.7 % were achieved in the differentiation of PT from nPT by proton-MRSI. CONCLUSION: (1)H-MRSI has a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between therapy-related effects and the relapse of irradiated gliomas. This method allows for assessment of the probability of radiotherapy response or failure

Brain tumors were irradiated postoperatively by Hatanaka and co-workers in Japan using a 1 to 2 hour intraarterial infusion of 10B-enriched Na2B12H11SH (Na210B12H11SH) before exposure of the tumor-bearing area of the brain to slow neutrons from a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor. The clinical outcome of such boron neutron capture therapy has been favorably impressive in some patients, but its efficacy in brain tumors needs improvement. In our study, a terminally ill patient with malignant astrocytoma was infused intravenously with Na210B12H11SH for 25 hours. The postmortem distribution of 10B in unfixed, frozen, tumor-bearing brain and spinal cord tissues was studied by comparing representative cryostat sections of these specimens with neutron-induced heavy charged particle radiographs of the same sections. Preferential accumulation of 10B was observed in the tumor, with relatively little accumulation of 10B in the parenchyma of the central nervous system

The primary endpoints of local control and the documentation of any MRI T2-weighted changes in contiguous brain tissues are discussed. METHODS: Between 1/95 and 1/97, 19 patients were planned with the X-Knife 3-D planning system (Radionics, Burlington, Mass., USA) and received a median dose of 46 Gy in daily 2.0-Gy fractions. Treatments were delivered stereotactically with a dedicated 600SR linear accelerator (Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Immobilization was achieved with the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame. The mean tumor size was 2.24 cm. The mean prescription isodose was 87%. The mean age was 53 years (10 male, 9 female). The mean follow-up time was 10 months (range 1-24 months). The mean optic chiasm and brain stem doses were calculated at 38 and 13 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postgadolinum-enhanced MRI scans and Humphrey visual field tests. RESULTS: In the posttreatment period, local control (absence of tumor progression) has been achieved in all of the patients. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. No acute complications, no visual changes and no T2-weighted MRI or proton density changes were documented in any of the 19 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that SRT compares favorably with conventional radiotherapy in achieving local control. The doses to the brainstem and the temporal lobes are significantly decreased and at early follow-up no white matter changes are seen on MRI after SRT. The true frequency of grade 1-4 changes are likely underestimated as similar changes often occur in association with tumor edema or after surgery. Given the uncertain neurocognitive significance of the white matter changes associated with treating these benign tumors by conventional radiotherapy, we are currently treating all pituitary adenomas with fractionated SRT to reduce the potential sequelae

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

For these 30 cases, the diagnosis was made by B ultrasonography only when the volume of the extension was important, between 20 and 2280 mm3. The Cox model multi-variant analysis was used to study the statistically significant parameters in the development of an extrascleral extension. It appears that the maximal diameter of the intraocular tumor (p = 0.0012), the localisation of the anterior margin (p = 0.0304) and the age of the patients (p = 0.0097) are statistically meaningful. The 4 years' survival, studied with the Kaplan-Meier curves, is estimated at 60% for the patients with extrascleral extension and at 85% for the patients without. These results are similar to those of literature, whatever treatment is chosen (enucleation and radiotherapy, exenteration)

Since January 1991 we treated 3 retinoblastomas with proton beam at the cyclotron of Louvain-la-Neuve. Results are encouraging. The short term outcome seems comparable to phototherapy, but the long term expectancy is better, because of reduced secondary malignancies. Proton beam treatment for selected retinoblastomas seems a good alternative to external radiotherapy

The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC. METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy. RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence. CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients	
1	534	The impact of IMRT and proton radiotherapy on secondary cancer incidence	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Incidence, Male, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Phantoms,Imaging, Photons, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Risk Factors, Scattering,Radiation, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is concern about the increase of radiation-induced malignancies with the application of modern radiation treatment techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and proton radiotherapy. Therefore, X-ray scatter and neutron radiation as well as the impact of the primary dose distribution on secondary cancer incidence are analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential and a plateau dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 30 patients who received radiation therapy of prostate cancer. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used in eleven patients, another eleven patients received IMRT with 6-MV photons, and eight patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. The treatment plans were recalculated with 15-MV and 18-MV photons. Secondary cancer risk was estimated based on the OED for the different treatment techniques. RESULTS: A modest increase of 15% radiation-induced cancer results from IMRT using low energies (6 MV), compared to conventional four-field planning with 15-MV photons (plateau dose-response: 1%). The probability to develop a secondary cancer increases with IMRT of higher energies by 20% and 60% for 15 MV and 18 MV, respectively (plateau dose-response: 2% and 30%). The use of spot-scanned protons can reduce secondary cancer incidence as much as 50% (independent of dose-response). CONCLUSION: By including the primary dose distribution into the analysis of radiation-induced cancer incidence, the resulting increase in risk for secondary cancer using modern treatment techniques such as IMRT is not as dramatic as expected from earlier studies. By using 6-MV photons, only a moderate risk increase is expected. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice in regard to secondary cancer incidence

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52.3 years (14-85), were treated using 201 MeV proton beam of the centre de protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), 49 for a chordoma and 18 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented 2/3 of the total dose and protons 1/3. The median total dose delivered within gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 32 months (4-71), the 3-year local control rates were for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of 70.8% and 85.2%, respectively and 4-year overall survival rates of 87.7% and 75%, respectively. Fourteen tumours (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the gross tumor volume, four into the CTV and 2 in an unknown site). Seven patients died of tumour and one of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, age inferieur ou egal a 52.3 years (p = 0.002), maximum tumoral diameter < 44.7 mm (p = 0.02) and GTV < 28.4 mL (0.02), at time of radiotherapy, influenced positively the local control. According to multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. Only five (7.7%) patients presented grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In base of skull chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combined photon and proton therapy offers excellent chances of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity.

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 188 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas (<15 mm in diameter and <5 mm in height) near the optic disc or macula (within 4 disc diameters of either structure). METHODS: Patients were treated with proton beam therapy at doses of either 50 CGE or 70 CGE between October 1989 and July 1994, and followed up biannually through April 1998. Outcomes included visual acuity, radiation complications, melanoma recurrence, and metastasis. RESULTS: Proportions of patients retaining visual acuity of at least 20/200 were similar in the 2 dose groups at 5 years after radiation (approximately 55%). Similar numbers of patients in each group experienced tumor regrowth (2 patients at 50 CGE vs 3 patients at 70 CGE; P>.99) and metastasis (7 patients at 50 CGE vs 8 patients at 70 CGE;P=.79). Five-year rates of radiation maculopathy also were similar (for both groups, approximately 75% for tumors within 1 disc diameter and 40% for tumors >1 disc diameter from the macula). Rates of radiation papillopathy were nonsignificantly decreased in the 50-CGE treatment group when tumors were located 1 disc diameter or less from the optic disc (P=.20). Patients treated with the lower dose also experienced significantly less visual field loss. CONCLUSIONS: This level of dose reduction did not result in a lesser degree of visual acuity loss. The lower-dose group did experience significantly less visual field loss. Local tumor recurrence and metastatic death rates were similar in both dose groups. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:773-778

Their primary lesions received a radiation dose of 48 to 70.4 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 16 to 18 fractions. MR imaging of radiation-induced brain injury was graded as follows: Grade 1: change in focal white matter; focal contrast enhancement and surrounding edema; Grade 2: nonenhanced area or cystic lesion in enhanced lesion; Grade 3: focal necrosis with mass effect; and Grade 4: mass effect requiring surgical intervention. Radiation-induced brain injury appeared as early as 2 months and as late as 57 months after carbon ion therapy (mean interval, 22.2 months). MR findings of initial lesion were Grade 1 in 26 cases (65.0%), Grade 2 in 13 (32.5%), and Grade 3 in 1 (2.5%). Brain injury was always found in the radiation field initially, but cystic lesion and edema later extended outside the field in 10 cases (25.0%). In follow-up MR studies, size of edema or enhanced lesion was reduced in 17 patients (42.5%) without treatment. Two cases with large cystic lesions required surgery. Improvement of radiation-induced brain injury was observed more often than had been previously described. Because edema and cystic lesion can occasionally extend outside the radiation field, such findings do not exclude the possibility of radiation-induced brain injury. Careful observation is recommended because cystic lesions can enlarge enough to require surgical treatment in some cases

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with skull base chordoma who were treated with proton beams with or without X-rays at the University of Tsukuba between 1989 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A median total tumor dose of 72.0 Gy (range, 63.0-95.0 Gy) was delivered. The patients were followed for a median period of 69.3 months (range, 14.6-123.4 months). RESULTS: The 5-year local control rate was 46.0%. Cause-specific, overall, and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 72.2%, 66.7%, and 42.2%, respectively. The local control rate was higher, without statistical significance, for those with preoperative tumors <30 mL. Partial or subtotal tumor removal did not yield better local control rates than for patients who underwent biopsy only as the latest surgery. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is effective for patients with skull base chordoma, especially for those with small tumors. For a patient with a tumor of <30 mL with no prior treatment, biopsy without tumor removal seems to be appropriate before proton beam therapy. [References: 38]

By revealing a decrease of the N-acetyl-aspartate/choline ratio in the pons, 1H MR spectroscopy anticipated lesions growth on MR imaging. In line with the results in four patients reported in the literature, our observation indicates that external radiation therapy is not effective for intracranial involvement in ECD	
0	94	Sacrococcygeal chordomas: potential role of high LET therapy. [Review] [27 refs]	Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Pelvic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pelvic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Sacrococcygeal Region, Survival Rate	Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms representing less than 3% of all primary bone tumors. They usually have a benign histological appearance and a slow growth rate. Their locoregional progression nearly always causes suffering and eventually death. Efforts to increase local control have included aggressive surgery, radiation therapy or combined approaches but locally free survival rates remain relatively low and have not exceeded 30% at 5 years. Sacrococcygeal chordomas, which represent approximately 50% of the localizations, have been investigated less frequently than those at the base of the skull or cervical region with primary or post-operative radiation therapy. The disappointing results with photon therapy in a multimodality approach and the good results reported by Schoenthaler with charged particles in the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory led us to propose fast neutron therapy in the management of inoperable or recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. Preliminary results obtained from only 12 patients indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy seems to be a good alternative for radical treatment of chordomas in the case of microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor.

The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since January 1990, 97 patients with locally advanced carcinomas of the naso-, oro-, hypopharynx and the oral cavity in UICC stages III and IV were treated according to an accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy schedule with concurrent chemotherapy. The primary tumor and positive lymph nodes received a total dose of 72 Gy in 6 weeks. In the first 3 weeks, large fields were irradiated 5 times per week with 2 Gy per fraction. Thereafter, treatment was accelerated, giving 2 daily fractions of 1.4 Gy with minimal intervals of 6 hours. Target volumes were reduced after 49.6 and 59.4 Gy, excluding clinically uninvolved lymph node regions of low and high risk. On day 1, 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 50 mg/m2 folinic acid were given as intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion of 350 mg/m2 5-FU and 100 mg/m2 folinic acid, days 1 to 5. 10 mg/m2 mitomycin C was given on day 5 and 36 of the treatment. Salvage surgery was offered for residual disease 5 to 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Patient characteristics: 70 male, 27 female; age: 27 to 81 years; T2/T3/T4: 7/30/60; N0/N1/N2/N3: 20/18/53/6; nasopharynx/oropharynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity: 16/33/36/12. Median follow-up is 26 months. RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were RESULTS: Overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 2 years were 68 +/- 5% and 74 +/- 5%. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant influence of the geometric mean neck node diameter or the N-stage on loco-regional control and survival. T-stage, tumor volume, or tumor localisation did not become significant. Acute toxicity of this schedule was acceptable but required optimised supportive care. Treatment related grade 4+ late toxicity of mucosa, soft tissue and bone were observed with a cumulative frequency of 13% at 2 years. Two patients died during a phase of severe leuko- or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: This phase I to II trial shows favourable results using an intensified treatment radio-chemotherapy protocol. A phase III study is now planned, comparing this regime with an accelerated hyperfractionated radio-therapy alone to an increased total dose of 77.6 Gy

The optimal therapeutic management is unclear but, in general, this tumour is treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Proton beam radiation therapy (PT) offers superior dose distributional qualities compared with X- or gamma rays, as the dose deposition occurs in a modulated narrow zone called the Bragg peak. As a result, organs at risk are optimally speared. Here, we present a patient treated with the first spinal axis segment irradiation using spot-scanning PT with a single field, combined with conventional cranio-spinal axis radiotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy, and an extensive review of the literature outlining the clinical features and treatment modality of spinal PNET.

In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 10 patients were computed for both CP and PP. Prescribed dose was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for PP; 45 Gy (photons) and 22 CGE (protons) for CP. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), normal tissues (NT), and organs at risk (OARs) for each plan. Results were analyzed using DVH parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient (IC), and conformity index (CI). RESULTS: Mean doses delivered to the GTVs and CTVs with CP (65.0 and 61.7 CGE) and PP (65.3 and 62.2 Gy CGE) were not significantly different (p > 0.1 and p = 0.72). However, the dose inhomogeneity was drastically increased with CP, with a mean significant incremental IC value of 10.5% and CP of 6.8%, for both the GTV (p = 0.01) and CTV (p = 0.04), respectively. The CI(80%) values for the GTV and CTV were significantly higher with PP compared with CP. Compared with CP, the use of protons only led to a significant reduction of NT and OAR irradiation, in the intermediate-to-low dose (< or =80% isodose line) range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CP results in levels of target dose conformation similar to those with PP. Use of PP significantly reduced the tumor dose inhomogeneity and the delivered intermediate-to-low dose to NT and OARs, leading us to conclude that this treatment is mainly appropriate for tumors in children

The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, base-of-skull sarcomas, low-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and para-nasal sinus tumors. In addition, we have treated bone sarcomas in the neck and trunk--mainly in the sacral area--as well as prostate cases and some soft tissue sarcomas. PTV volumes for our treated cases are in the range 20-4500 ml, indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating lesions of all types and sizes. The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of fluence modulated Bragg peaks delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 000. With the current delivery rate of roughly 3000 Bragg peaks per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to 20-25 min. Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about 10% of delivered spots have a weight of more than 10% of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for optimizing the number of spots delivered per field. Field specific dosimetry shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within +/-1 mm (1 SD) orthogonal to the field direction and to within 1.5 mm in range. With our current delivery system the mean widths of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 mm (sigma) for all energies, indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be made. In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg peaks shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg peaks over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of penetration. This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast re-scanning on second generation scanning gantries

There were 18 females and 15 males with a median age of 26 years (range: 9-69) and a median follow-up time of 16 months (range: 7-32). The arteriovenous malformation volumes treated ranged from 0.2 to 42 cm3. The prescribed doses at the isocenter varied from 50 to 55 Gy and were given as a single fraction in the majority of the patients (31/33). Late complications consisting of intracranial bleeding and/or hemiparesis were observed in three patients. To date, 21 patients underwent repeat angiographic studies at 1 year post-treatment. A complete obliteration of the lesion was achieved in 38% of these patients. For the patients whose arteriovenous malformation nidus was covered by a minimum dose of 25 Gy, the total obliteration rate was 61.5% (8/13), whereas none of the patients who had received less than 25 Gy at the edge of the nidus obtained a total obliteration. Our preliminary analysis at 1 year post-radiosurgery reveals results comparable to those previously reported for other radiosurgical techniques for the same follow-up period

The fourteen patients had chordomas or low grade chondrosarcomas and were all treated by the same techniques. The median tumor dose was 69.7 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a range from 66.6 to 74.4 CGE. (CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co). The daily fraction size was 1.8-2.1 CGE. The median follow-up time is 48 months, ranging from 30 to 68 months. All treatments were planned using a computerized multi-dimensional system with the position of the pituitary outlined on the planning CT scan. Review of the dose distribution indicated that the dose to the pituitary ranged from 60.5 to 72.3 CGE, with a median of 67.6 CGE. One female patient had decreased thyroid and gonadotropin function at the time of diagnosis and has been on hormone replacement since that time. The other three females were all pre-menopausal at the time of radiotherapy. At this time four patients (3 males and 1 female) have developed endocrine abnormalities 14 to 45 months after irradiation. All four had evidence of hypothyroidism and two have also developed corticotropin deficiency. The three males had decreased testosterone levels; the female patient developed amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia. All four are asymptomatic with ongoing hormone replacement	
0	295	High-dose radiotherapy in the management of chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine: Part 1--Clinical outcomes	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome	AIMS: Patients with chordoma and chondrosarcoma in the skull base present a complex multidisciplinary problem. These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team	
1	1424	Effect of heavy-ion radiotherapy on pulmonary function in stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Carbon, Carbon Radioisotopes, Carbon Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pp [Physiopathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Heavy Ions, Humans, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/pp [Physiopathology], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Respiratory Function Tests, Retrospective Studies	STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of heavy-ion radiotherapy on pulmonary function in patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Research Center Hospital for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. PATIENTS: From a total of 81 patients who were not candidates for surgical resection due to medical reasons or patient refusal, and who were treated with carbon beam radiotherapy from October 1994 to February 1999, the 52 patients who had completed the repeat overall pulmonary function tests at 6 and 12 months after undergoing heavy-ion radiotherapy were examined. The total heavy-ion irradiation dose ranged from 59.4 to 95.4 photon gray equivalents (GyE), with a mean dose of 76.2 GyE. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to heavy-ion radiotherapy and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. Comparisons of all pulmonary function indexes between, before, and at 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy were made using repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Dunnett test for post hoc comparison. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in FEV(1) and total lung capacity was detected at both 6 and 12 months after the patient had undergone heavy-ion radiotherapy. No significant decreases in other pulmonary function indexes in patients were observed at either 6 or 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. The magnitude of the decrease in all pulmonary function indexes was < 8% at both 6 and 12 months after heavy-ion radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that heavy-ion radiotherapy is feasible for stage I NSCLC patients without a severe loss of pulmonary function	
1	374	A technique of partial breast irradiation utilizing proton beam radiotherapy: comparison with conformal x-ray therapy.[see comment]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Heart, Humans, Immobilization, Immobilization/is [Instrumentation], Prone Position, Protons, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, Vacuum, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To develop a breast immobilization system and clinical technique to deliver partial breast irradiation with a proton beam and compare dose distributions using proton therapy and conformal x-rays. METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival	
1	1102	[Endoresection following proton beam irradiation of large uveal melanomas]. [German]	Berlin, Combined Modality Therapy, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Incidence, Lenses,Intraocular, Liver, Male, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Necrosis, Neoadjuvant Therapy, Optic Nerve, Postoperative Complications/et [Etiology], Probability, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Recurrence, Retina/re [Radiation Effects], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects], Vitrectomy	PURPOSE: Large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or to the fovea have an unfavourable prognosis with regard to visual preservation and eye retention, due to the high incidence of radiation and tumour necrosis induced complications. Endoresection of the tumour after proton beam irradiation, is an alternative approach, aiming to reduce the incidence of ocular morbidity caused by tumour necrosis after sole radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with large uveal melanomas (mean tumour thickness: 9.1 mm, mean tumour volume: 0.77 cc), received a primary proton beam irradiation (60 CGE) and underwent subsequent endoresection via a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The median pretreatment visual acuity was 0.2. The mean follow-up was 13.9 months. RESULTS: The postoperative visual acuity after 12 months was 0.12 (median, mean visual acuity loss 0.08). The probability of developing radiation retinopathy or papillopathy within the first year after treatment was 35% and 28% respectively and the probability of enucleation was 9% within the first postoperative year. No tumour recurrences were observed and 2 patients developed liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Endoresection following irradiation of large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or the fovea seems to be a useful and safe alternative to the traditional irradiation or enucleation. The incidence of complications following our approach seems to be lower when compared to radiation alone, where tumour necrosis is a substantial problem

We report a case of diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the cavernous sinus with sphenoid sinus and clivial extension, treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and proton beam irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base lymphoma treated with protons. A 53-year-old female presented with a two-month history of diplopia, persistent headaches, and paresthesia over the left side of her mouth. A skull MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus and right sphenoid sinus. Transsphenoidal subtotal resection of the mass confirmed the presence of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of CHOP-R chemotherapy and locoregional radiation with protons. Locoregional radiation of the lesion required moderate doses, below the radiation tolerance of adjacent normal structures. Conformal protons were utilized to minimize the volume of normal brain receiving radiation. Conformal proton beam radiotherapy to a moderate dose proved valuable in this case because it minimized the volume of normal brain receiving low to moderate doses of radiation	
0	1996	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: repeat treatment with conformal proton therapy--dose-volume histogram analysis	Adult, Aged, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	PURPOSE: To analyze control, survival, and complication rates of conformal proton radiation for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications	
1	572	Influence of alpha and gamma radiations and non-radiation risk factors on the incidence of malignant liver tumors among Mayak PA workers	Alpha Particles, Biophysics, Body Burden, Case-Control Studies, Cohort Studies, Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Incidence, Liver Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Nuclear Reactors/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Occupational Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Occupational Exposure/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Russia/ep [Epidemiology]	This Mayak worker-based study focuses on evaluating possible associations between malignant liver cancers and chronic alpha irradiation, chronic gamma irradiation, and non-radiation risk factors (alcohol consumption, smoking, viral hepatitis, chemical exposure, and chronic digestive diseases). This is the first multivariate study related to liver cancer among Mayak workers. The study was performed using the nested, case-control approach and includes 44 cases of malignant liver tumors diagnosed from 1972 to 1999, and 111 matched controls. Adjusted odds ratio (OR(ad)) was evaluated relative to a group of workers with alpha radiation doses to liver (D(alpha)) < 2.0 Gy. Dose estimates of D(alpha) > 2.0 Gy (corresponding (239)Pu body burden estimates >20.4 kBq) were significantly associated (p < 0.003) with the occurrence of hemangiosarcomas (HAS) but only marginal significance (0.05 < p < 0.1) was found for hepatocellular cancers (HCC). The ORad for HAS was 41.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6, 333] for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-5.0 Gy and was 62.5 (7.4, 500) for a group with D(alpha) > 5.0-16.9 Gy. The attributable risk (AR) was calculated as 82%. For HCC, O(Rad) was estimated as 8.4 (0.8, 85.3; p < 0.07) for a group with D(alpha) in the range >2.0-9.3 Gy. For the indicated group, the AR was 14%. An association with high external gamma-ray doses (D(gamma)) to the total body was revealed for both HCC and for combined liver cancers when dose was treated as a continuous variable. However, we find no evidence that chronic low doses of gamma rays are associated with liver cancer occurrence. Cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) was not associated with either alpha- or gamma-ray exposure. As expected, an association between alcohol abuse and HCC was inferred [O(Rad) = 3.3 (1.2, 9); AR = 41%] but not for CHC or HAS

This technique allows treatment of small (less than 40 mm diameter) intracranial lesions, including vascular malformations, and primary and metastatic tumors that are deep within the brain or in areas not amenable to open surgery. A beam of ionizing radiation (1800 to 2500 cGy) is focused on the center of the lesion, which is determined by stereotactic localization. "Dynamic rotation" of the linac gantry and table continuously about this predetermined point ensures that only the lesion receives the full radiation dose, while the normal structures in the head receive minimal amounts of radiation. The system combines, for the first time in one place, elements of radiosurgical technique developed at various centers. Testing for accuracy compares favorably with results at other centers using linac-based systems as well as comparing favorably with the gamma knife

This boost dose was 20 Gy (Paris System) for submucosal lesions (seven patients) and 25 Gy for intramural (eight patients) and extramural (ten patients) lesions. With a mean follow-up of 40.5 months, there have been five local recurrences, the latest occurring 16 months post-tumorectomy. Two of these five patients are alive and disease-free 1 year post salvage abdominoperineal resection. The 20 patients with local control have preserved a full functional sphincter and 19 of them are disease-free; there were few complications. This sphincter preserving combined approach seems promising for patients with tumors of the middle and lower rectum who cannot undergo major surgery and for selected patients who refuse abdominoperineal resection	
1	1842	Pulmonary injury from proton and conventional radiotherapy as revealed by CT	Aged, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Incidence, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Prospective Studies, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiation, Radiation Pneumonitis/ra [Radiography], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	OBJECTIVE: Although radiation therapy is used in early-stage inoperable lung cancer, it often results in injury to functional lung tissue. A study was undertaken to determine the frequency and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT in patients who had undergone conformal proton (to a limited volume) radiation therapy. We compared these findings with those from a group of patients who had undergone a combination of photon and conformal proton (to a larger volume) radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Proton radiation therapy was associated with a lower frequency of pulmonary injury than the combined regimen. Injury correlated well with the volume of normal lung that was irradiated. Conformal proton radiation therapy appears to be able to reduce the incidence and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT	
1	2421	The 62 MeV proton beam for the treatment of ocular melanoma at Clatterbridge	Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Scattering,Radiation, Water	A second treatment room and beam line has been constructed at the Cyclotron Unit at Clatterbridge for the purpose of using 62 MeV protons for the treatment of ocular melanoma. A uniform beam is produced by a double foil scattering system. The initial Bragg peak is spread across the target volume by the use of beam modulators. These are rotating four-vaned stepped absorbers made from Perspex. Two beam lines can be configured with different positions of modulators and range limiters. The first has a maximum penetration of 31.9 +/- 0.2 mm in water and the second a penetration of 31.2 +/- 0.2 mm. The second configuration has the advantage of less variation in beam penumbra, with a typical value of 1.7 +/- 0.1 mm for the 90% to 10% decrement lines. The patients are treated with individually shaped collimators. Beam output varies by less than 2% over the range of collimator areas used. The resulting whole-body dose equivalent to patient has also been assessed. In the first three years of operation over 250 patients have been treated

Potential of proton beam as an alternative to brachytherapy	Aged, Brachytherapy, Female, Humans, Japan, Lymphatic Irradiation, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uterine Cervicitis/et [Etiology], Vaginal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Vaginal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vaginitis/et [Etiology]	Fifteen patients with advanced gynecologic malignancies were treated with high-energy proton beam radiation therapy (RT) at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center (PARMS), Tsukuba University, Japan, from 1983 to 1987. The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response	
0	1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses	
1	2361	Late rectal bleeding following combined X-ray and proton high dose irradiation for patients with stages T3-T4 prostate carcinoma	Arm, Boston, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/ep [Epidemiology], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Hospitalization, Humans, Incidence, Male, Methods, Photons, Probability, Prospective Studies, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectal Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Rectal Diseases/et [Etiology], Rectum, Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Survival Rate, Time Factors	PURPOSE: Dose escalation for prostate cancer by external beam irradiation is feasible by a 160 MeV perineal proton beam that reduces the volume of rectum irradiated. We correlated the total doses received to portions of the anterior rectum to study the possible relationship of the volume irradiated to the incidence of late rectal toxicity. METHODS: We have randomized 191 patients with stages T3 and T4 prostatic carcinoma to one of two treatment dose arms. These were: 1) 75.6 Cobalt-Gy-equivalent (CGE), 50.4 Gy delivered by 107-25 MV photons followed by 25.2 CGE delivered perineally by protons (Arm 1) or 2) 67.2 CGE delivered by 10-25 MV photons (Arm 2). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, post-irradiation rectal bleeding (grades 1 and 2 only, none requiring surgery or hospitalization) from telangiectatic rectal mucosal vessels has occurred in 34% of 99 Arm-1 patients and 16% of 92 Arm-2 patients (p = 0.013). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anterior rectal wall, the posterior rectal wall and the total rectum in 41 patients treated on Arm 1 were calculated from the three dimensional dose distributions. Rectal bleeding has occurred in 14 or 34% of the 41 DVH-analyzed subset of Arm-1 patients. Both the fractional volume of the anterior rectum and the total dose received by fractional volumes of the anterior rectum significantly correlate with the actuarial probability of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians planning dose escalation to men with localized prostate cancer should approve with caution treatment plans raising more than 40% of the anterior rectum to more than 75 CGE without additional effort to protect the rectal mucosa because this late sequela data indicate that more than half of these men will otherwise have rectal bleeding

However, psychological distress and anxiety related to irradiation are often observed. Purpose of our study was the evaluation of the influence of radiotherapy-induced distress in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and June 1996 in 48 breast cancer patients (31 to 76 years old) treated by breast-conserving surgery adjuvant irradiation with or without systemic therapy was applied. On the first and the last day of radiotherapy they were given a questionnaire (Table 1) which was designed together with psychologists. Covering different situations related to radiotherapy the construction of items are determined by factors with possible influence on psychological distress and perception with regard to irradiation. RESULTS: Most of the women (92%) stated to be well informed about the irradiation and tried to obtain further information about this treatment (83%). 56% tried not to think about radiotherapy and/or to distract themselves (81%). 40% were anxious about the fact to undergo irradiation. In the end of treatment 77% reported to have been anxious only initially or never; only 19% were anxious almost or most of the time. 35% were worried about the expected cosmetic alterations of their breast; only 30% observed acute cosmetic changes. With regard to situation-related distress all patients (100%) stated that the communication with the medical staff made it easier to stand the irradiation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of theoretical considerations our results are explorative in character. However, following statements seem to be important: 1. A large requirement exists to get information about radiotherapy. 2. The patients experience irradiation treatment more positive than initially expected by themselves. 3. With regard to radiotherapy anxiety is reduced during the course of treatment. Here the psychosocial care of the medical staff is an important support for reduction of anxiety

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1994 to March 2000, 163 patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Analysis was performed on 54 optic nerves (ONs) corresponding to 30 patients whose ONs had been included in the irradiated volume. These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of >4 years. All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before treatment. We evaluated the dose-complication probability and the prognostic factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon ion radiotherapy, using dose-volume histograms and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age of 30 patients (14 men, 16 women) was 57.2 years. Median prescribed total dose was 56.0 gray equivalents (GyE) at 3.0-4.0 GyE per fraction per day (range, 48-64 GyE; 16-18 fractions; 4-6 weeks). Of 54 ONs that were analyzed, 35 had been irradiated with <57 GyE (maximum dose [Dmax]) resulting in no visual loss. Conversely, 11 of the 19 ONs (58%) irradiated with >57 GyE (Dmax) suffered a decrease of visual acuity. In all of these cases, the ONs had been involved in the tumor before carbon ion radiotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, a dose of 20% of the volume of the ON (D20) was significantly associated with visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of visual loss seems to be correlated with a delivery of >60 GyE to 20% of the volume of the ON

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

In our department, between January 1995 to January 2001, we treated eleven patients with mycosis fungoides by total body skin electron irradiation to evaluate its influence. According to our knowledge, our department is the only center in Turkey capable of applying total skin electron beam therapy. Total skin electron beam therapy was applied by using the "translational technique". Daily doses (4 Gray) were given in a total of seven fractions according to the conventional fractionation scheme. There were 6 patients with stage I disease, 3 patients with stage II and 2 patients with stage IV disease. Except stage IV patients, we obtained good cutaneous results. According to our observation, in early stage mycosis fungoides total body skin electron irradiation can provide good cutaneous response, but for stage IV only moderate pallation can be obtained

Among the 4 eligible randomized studies including non-small-cell lung cancer patients in complete remission of stage II (N1) disease, none demonstrated a significant advantage on survival. In addition, some of these studies disclosed an apparently deleterious effect after postoperative radiotherpy. Although the modalities and the technical quality of radiotherapy and surgical resection were different for the different studies or within a given study, or in some of the older studies even obsolete, and although the precision of the outcome evaluation can be criticized, there is currently no argument for proposing postoperative radiotherapy as a routine systematic practice with conventional methods of bidimensional dosimetric planification after complete surgical resection with good quality mediastinal node dissection for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with stage II (N1) disease. However, the contribution of postoperative radiotherpy with sufficient means for performing tridimensional conformational radiotherapy with individual optimization of computerized dosimetric planification taking into account the residual respiratory function after surgery remains to be evaluated in randomized prospective studies with rigorous control of the technical quality of the surgical resection and the radiotherapy and a precise statistical analysis of the locoregional and distant events in case of incomplete surgical resection and in more advanced stage disease (parietal T3, N0, stage III N2)

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

The complete radiotherapy process using heavy ions was carefully analyzed and divided into three areas related to beam delivery and control, safety-interlock system and medical physics issues. In this paper, the medical physics issues are addressed. Since the irradiation with heavy ions is a nonstandard modality, new concepts and ion specific tests were developed. As far as possible, national and international standard specifications for radiotherapy were adopted. For each aspect, a performance characteristic and a corresponding acceptance test were introduced. In addition, test characteristics for the constancy tests were established. For all tests, intervention thresholds and test frequencies were specified. Using the described protocol of acceptance tests, the commissioning was passed successfully. The heavy ion irradiation facility was approved by the governmental authorities on the basis of these test results. During clinical operation, constancy tests are performed at the beginning of each treatment period, in order to maintain the quality found during the acceptance tests. Up to now, 48 patients have been treated within 6 treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The concepts used and the tests developed for the quality assurance program may serve as an example of how to introduce systematically a quality assurance program for a new treatment modality

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance

In seven normal subjects at 1.5 T the nOe values were 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0 +/- 0.3, and 0.3 +/- 0.2 for myocardial PCr, gamma-ATP, alpha-ATP, and beta-ATP, respectively, not significantly different from those in chest muscle. Distortion of the measured PCr/ATP ratios due to differences in the nOe may require accurate correction to realize the full benefit of the effect in studies involving quantitative intergroup comparisons

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the records of 74 patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1957 and 1995. The histologic types included squamous cell carcinoma in 6 (8.1%), nonkeratinizing carcinoma in 48 (64.9%), and undifferentiated carcinoma in 20 (27%) cases. The site of recurrence was in the primary in 46 (62.2%), in the neck nodes in 20 (27%), and in both sites in 8 (10.8%) patients. The recurrent disease was Stage I in 10 (13.5%), Stage II in 16 (21.6%), Stage III in 20 (27%), and Stage IV in 28 (37.9%) patients. Thirty-seven (50%) patients developed recurrence within 2 years and 58 (78.4%) within 5 years after initial treatment. Radiotherapeutic techniques used in the retreatment of primary recurrence consisted of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), intracavitary brachytherapy, heavy-charged particle beam, and gamma knife, alone or in combination. Reirradiation doses ranged from 18 to 108 Gy, with a median dose of 60 Gy. Treatment of recurrent neck nodes consisted of radical neck dissection (RND) +/- intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), or EBRT +/- hyperthermia, or chemotherapy +/- hyperthermia. Chemotherapy was used in 22 (30%) patients. Median follow-up was 20 months (range: 2 to 308 months). RESULTS: The 3-, 5-, and 10-year actuarial overall survival following retreatment were 49, 37, 18%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (49%) were free of further local-regional recurrence after retreatment. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year local-regional progression-free rates were 52, 40, and 38%, respectively. On univariate analysis, histologic type (p < 0.0001), interval to recurrence (p = 0.034), and treatment modality for early-stage disease (p = 0.01) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival, with age being marginally significant (p = 0.053). For local-regional progression-free rate, only histology was significant (p = 0.035). On multivariate analysis, age (p = 0.026), histology (p = 0.015), and interval to recurrence (p = 0.030) were significant for overall survival, and only histology (p = 0.002) and presence of complications (p = 0.016) were significant for local-regional progression-free rate. Of the 64 reirradiated patients, late complications were documented in 29 (45%) patients. The late complications were permanent in 21 (33%) and severe in 15 (23%) patients. CONCLUSION: Retreatment using radiotherapy alone or in combination with other treatment modalities can achieve long-term local-regional control and survival in a substantial proportion of patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Age, histology, and interval to recurrence were independent prognostic factors for overall survival, but only histology and presence of complications were significant for local-regional progression-free rate

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

The treatment is based on a versatile, non-invasive interface for stereotactic localization of the brain target imaged by computed tomography (CT), angiography or magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), and subsequent repetitive stereotactic irradiation of the target using a linear accelerator. The fractionation of the stereotactic irradiation was intended to meet the requirements of the basic principles of radiobiology. The radiophysical evaluation using phantoms, and the clinical results in a small number of patients, demonstrated a good reproducibility between repeated positionings of the target in the isocenter of the accelerator, and a high degree of accuracy in the treatment of brain lesions

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range: 14-85 years), were treated at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), France, using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range: 60-70 CGE). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 4-71 months), the 3-year local control rates were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates 88% and 75%, respectively. 14 tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical target volume [CTV], and two without further assessment). Seven patients died from their tumor and another one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and, similarly, the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age < or = 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter < 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV < 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on local control. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure. In two thirds of the cases, relapses are located in the GTV. Maximum diameter, GTV, and age are prognostic indicators of local control. These results should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with skull base chordoma who were treated with proton beams with or without X-rays at the University of Tsukuba between 1989 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A median total tumor dose of 72.0 Gy (range, 63.0-95.0 Gy) was delivered. The patients were followed for a median period of 69.3 months (range, 14.6-123.4 months). RESULTS: The 5-year local control rate was 46.0%. Cause-specific, overall, and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 72.2%, 66.7%, and 42.2%, respectively. The local control rate was higher, without statistical significance, for those with preoperative tumors <30 mL. Partial or subtotal tumor removal did not yield better local control rates than for patients who underwent biopsy only as the latest surgery. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is effective for patients with skull base chordoma, especially for those with small tumors. For a patient with a tumor of <30 mL with no prior treatment, biopsy without tumor removal seems to be appropriate before proton beam therapy. [References: 38]

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

[Review] [23 refs] [Russian]	Chordoma, Head, Humans, Melanoma, Neck, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Sarcoma, Skull, Universities	Investigations in proton beam therapy of cancer patients have been initiated at the Cyclotron Laboratory, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA, since 1974 using a proton beam with the energy of 160 MeV for fractionated irradiation of uveal melanoma (899 cases), chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull (96), sarcoma of the soft tissues and bones (79), prostatic cancer, head and neck tumors, etc. (altogether 1331 patients had been irradiated by June, 1986). To stop a beam in the target computer-assisted three-dimensional design and heterogeneity calculations were performed; computed compensatory boles were produced. Proton beam therapy is used alone or in combination with proton beam irradiation, routine radiotherapy. Areas of particular interest are ocular melanoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull, paraspinal sarcomas. Investigations in the field of proton beam therapy of malignant meningioma, metastases to the paraaortic lymph nodes hold promise. [References: 23]

Only 2% of 99 patients with small tumors and 4% of 566 patients with intermediate size tumors underwent enucleation after treatment; 10% of 341 patients with large tumors lost the treated eye. No eyes were removed after 52 months, with 89% of enucleations performed during the first 36 months after treatment. Eye retention rates at 60 months were 89.1 +/- 3.0% for the entire group, and 97 +/- 3.7%, 92.7 +/- 3.1%, and 78.3 +/- 7.0% in patients with small, intermediate, and large tumors, respectively. Significantly greater enucleation rates were observed in patients with large tumors than in those with intermediate tumors (p = less than .0001), in patients with tumor height greater than 8 mm relative to those with tumors less than or equal to 8 mm, p = (less than .0001), with tumor diameter greater than 16 mm compared to less than or equal to 16 mm, (p = less than .0001), and with tumor involvement of the ciliary body compared to involvement of the choroid only (p = less than .0001). Possible strategies to decrease the likelihood of enucleation in patients at apparently increased risk of losing the eye after conservative therapy, that is, those with large tumors involving the ciliary body, might include a lower total dose, a more protracted treatment course, or a lower radiation dose and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with hyperthermia, or with other radiation sensitizers

Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas

OBJECTIVE: To present the surgical technique of total spondylectomy for a chordoma of the C5 vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Malignant bone tumors require wide resection. Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins. METHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: Total en bloc spondylectomy with wide surgical margins is feasible for malignant bone tumors of the cervical spine

Patient treatments within the pilot project are carried out by radiation oncologists of the University of Heidelberg in cooperation with the Department of Biophysics of GSI, the Division of Medical Physics of the German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg and the Research Center Rossendorf. Patients are treated within three beam time blocks of 20 days per year at the basic physics research center at GSI, the overall capacity per year being 45 to 50 patients. Main purpose of the pilot project was to investigate carbon ion radiation therapy for different tumor entities within clinical phase I/II trials.

0	989	Comparison of different external beam treatment techniques to deliver high-dose irradiation to local recurrent rectal carcinoma	Aged, Carcinoma/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Prone Position, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Treatment Outcome	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Treatment of local-regional recurrent rectal carcinoma is a challenging problem, and local control may be dose dependent; doses should probably exceed 60 Gy. Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients irradiated with a Cobalt unit and twenty irradiated with 15 MeV photons in a linear accelerator were used for comparison of the dose delivered. Each irradiation was repeated eight times during four consecutive days up to a total dose of 12.6 Gy in the whole body (below 10 Gy in the lungs). Lateral fields were used in six fractions, and anterior-posterior fields in two fractions. An electron boost to the thorax wall was added. Doses were calculated and measured in-vivo in ten transverse sections. RESULTS: For the patient taken as an example doses in the middle of the lungs were 10.7 Gy for Co-60 and 11.2 Gy for 15 MeV photons without compensators and 9.6 Gy, 9.6 Gy respectively when compensators were applied. Mean doses in the lungs in the group were 9.5 Gy for Co-60 and 9.7 Gy for X 15 MeV, respectively. Duration of the treatment was shorter with the use of the 15 MeV than that with Co-60 by about 20%. Repositioning of the patient during two fractions with the use of X 15 MeV could be eliminated and therefore the patient's comfort increased

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

DESIGN: Systematic literature study. METHOD: Systematic electronic searches were carried out in 12 databases according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, without restriction as to year of publication or study design. Manual searches of bibliographies and journals were also performed. The inclusion criteria were: at least 20 patients and a follow-up of at least 2 years. In addition, experts on the subject were consulted by correspondence for their opinion. RESULTS: The search identified 36 relevant articles on proton therapy and 15 on ion therapy. Based on prospective and retrospective studies, proton irradiation emerged as the treatment of choice for ocular tumours, chordomas and skull-base tumours. For prostate cancer, the results were comparable with the best results of photon therapy. Ion therapy was still in an experimental phase. CONCLUSION: According to the current literature, proton therapy is looked upon as the preferred treatment modality for certain rare tumours, such as ocular tumours, chordoma, and skull-base tumours. However, charged particle therapy as a whole, and especially ion therapy, is not supported as the treatment of choice for cancer by published evidence. Nevertheless, the potential theoretical benefit of this treatment is great. [References: 68]

This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions

We retrospectively analyzed patients with brain metastases of malignant melanoma who were treated at our institution for outcome and prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 64 patients with 122 cerebral metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery between 1986 and 2000. Twelve patients (19%) showed neurologic symptoms at the time of treatment, and 46 patients (72%) had extracerebral tumor manifestation at that time. The median dose to the 80% isodose line, prescribed to encompass the tumor margin, was 20 Gy (range, 15-22 Gy). RESULTS: Neurologic symptoms improved in five of twelve symptomatic patients. 41 patients remained asymptomatic or unchanged in their neurologic symptoms. Only five patients (8%) temporarily worsened neurologically after therapy despite no signs of tumor progression. With a mean follow-up time of 9.4 months, actuarial local control was 81% after 1 year. There was a statistically significant dose and size dependency of local tumor control. Median actuarial survival after treatment was 10.6 months. Patients without extracerebral tumor manifestation showed a superior survival (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high local tumor control rates, the prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases of malignant melanoma remains poor. Stereotactic radiosurgery has the potential of stabilizing or improving neurologic symptoms in these patients in a palliative setting

A beam penetration of f27 mm would be required to treat 90% of the lesions. We conclude that a machine energy of at least 55 and, preferably, 60 MeV would be necessary for a clinically viable therapy unit for the treatment of choroidal melanomas. An extracted beam current of 10(-9) A would be more than sufficient

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1981 and November 1996, 46 patients with partially resected, biopsied, or recurrent meningiomas (median age of 50 years; range 11-74 years) were treated with combined photon and 160-MeV proton beam therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, using computed tomography-based conformal 3D treatment planning. Nine patients were treated after incomplete tumor resection, 8 patients after tumor biopsy only, and 29 patients after tumor recurrence following gross total (10/29 patients) or progression after subtotal (19/29 patients) resection. All patients were classified as benign meningioma on review slides at MGH. The median dose to the macroscopic gross tumor volume was 59.0 CGE (range 53.1-74.1 CGE, CGE = proton Gy x 1.1 RBE). The median follow-up was 53 months (range 12-207). RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 93 and 77%, respectively, and the recurrence-free rate at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 88%, respectively. Survival without severe toxicity was 80% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients presented with local tumor recurrence at 61, 95, and 125 months. One patient developed distant intradural metastasis at 21 and 88 months. No patient died from recurrent meningioma; however, 4 patients died of other causes. A fifth patient died from a brainstem necrosis after 22 months. Eight patients developed severe long-term toxicity from radiotherapy, including ophthalmologic (4 patients), neurologic (4 patients), and otologic (2 patients) complications. All patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic nerve structures in the current protocol. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with recurrent or incompletely resected benign intracranial menigiomas. Observed toxicity appears to be dose-related; with currently employed dose constraints, toxicity should not exceed that seen in patients treated with conformal fractionated supervoltage photon radiotherapy

These patients refuse to go in to surgery or have indications for surgery (183 patients--T(1-4)N(0-3)M(0-1)). This method consists of the combination of the traditional method of the whole breast and/or nodal photon irradiation with local highly concentrated proton irradiation in the dosage iso-equivalent to tumor (proton with energy from 130 to 180 MeV, with stop in the target in notice depth). We used the irradiation of the adenohypophysis with narrow proton beams energy 200 MeV. The aim of the first combination of the components is the selectively influence on the target and the channeling to the tumor and its subclinical substances the dosages sufficient for the total irradiation of tumor with sparing surrounding tissues and parts of body. The goal of irradiation of adenohypophysis with protons is the normalization of its hormonal activity and elimination of factors stimulating growth of tumor cells in case of dishormonal cancer. The suggested method didu't only improve the results of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, but also contributed to the reducing of the emotional stress. We received high results of the patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer of criteria: local control rate (96%), long remission (more then 40%) and 5-year actuarial survival rate (83%). The patients examined during 5 and 18 years. It made a good cosmetic effect and high quality life of the patients with breast cancer

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and August 1998 we treated 35 patients with stage cT1-3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. Thirty-two patients with a follow-up of 12 to 28 months (median: 18 months) were evaluated. After ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of 4 non-parallel needles, CT based 3D brachytherapy treatment planning ("Offenbach system") was performed. All patients received 4 fractions brachytherapy using a fractional dose of 5 or 7 Gy. Time between each fraction was 14 days. After brachytherapy 3D external irradiation followed up to 39.6 or 45.0 Gy. All patients received androgen deprivation, starting 2 to 19 months before brachytherapy, ending 3 months after 3D external radiotherapy. RESULTS: Posttreatment PSA levels dropped to < 1.5 ng/ml in 29/32 patients (91%). In 25 patients PSA levels were < 0.5 ng/ml, in 4 patients 0.5 to 1.5 ng/ml. In 2 patients we noted biochemical relapse. Transrectal implantation was very well tolerated. Grade 3 acute urinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient. We noted no Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient developed a Grade 3 late urinary toxicity. No patient showed late gastrointestinal side effects. All 140 dose-volume histograms for 3D HDR brachytherapy were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The new 3D HDR brachytherapy technique, combined with 3D external irradiation and androgen deprivation, is a feasible, so far well-tolerated and effective treatment in the short-time follow-up of median 18 months

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

We retrospectively analyzed our experience in 239 patients to assess treatment outcome with this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1990, 239 uveal melanoma patients were treated with 125I plaques at the University of California, San Francisco. High intensity 125I seeds in the range of 3-20 mCi were used to give a minimum tumor dose of 70 Gy in 4 days. Initial mean tumor size was 10.9 mm x 9.2 mm x 5.5 mm with a range in tumor diameter from 4 to 18 mm and tumor height from 1.9 to 11.1 mm. Best corrected pre-treatment visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 92% of patients. RESULTS: Local tumor control was maintained in 91.7% of patients with a mean follow-up of 35.9 months; 19 patients had local tumor progression; mean time to progression was 27.3 mo (1.8 to 60.1 mo). Actuarial local control is 82% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrates significant correlation of local failure with larger maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0008), closer proximity to the fovea (p = 0.0001), lower radiation dose (p = 0.0437), and smaller ultrasound height (p = 0.0034). The actuarial incidence of distant metastases is 12% at 5 years with multivariate analysis showing significant correlation only with maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0064). Visual outcome is 20/200 or better in 58% of patients. CONCLUSION: While the tumor control rates appear favorable, ocular morbidity is significant. A current randomized trial comparing 125I plaque with Helium ion therapy is in progress with specific comparison of tumor control, survival, and visual outcome

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for this study were: solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); no indication for surgery or local ablation therapy; no ascites; age >/= 20 years; Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2; no serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis; written informed consent. PRT was administered in doses of 76 cobalt gray equivalent in 20 fractions for 5 weeks. No patients received transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation in combination with PRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between May 1999 and February 2003. There were 20 male and 10 female patients, with a median age of 70 years. Maximum tumor diameter ranged from 25 to 82 mm (median, 45 mm). All patients had liver cirrhosis, the degree of which was Child-Pugh class A in 20, and class B in 10 patients. Acute reactions of PRT were well tolerated, and PRT was completed as planned in all patients. Four patients died of hepatic insufficiency without tumor recurrence at 6 to 9 months. Three of these four patients had pretreatment indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes of more than 50%. After a median follow-up period of 31 months (16 to 54 months), only one patient experienced recurrence of the primary tumor, and 2-year actuarial local progression-free rate was 96% (95% CI, 88% to 100%). Actuarial overall survival rate at 2 years was 66% (48% to 84%). CONCLUSION: PRT showed excellent control of the primary tumor, with minimal acute toxicity. Further study is warranted to scrutinize adequate patient selection in order to maximize survival benefit of this promising modality

The primary endpoints of local control and the documentation of any MRI T2-weighted changes in contiguous brain tissues are discussed. METHODS: Between 1/95 and 1/97, 19 patients were planned with the X-Knife 3-D planning system (Radionics, Burlington, Mass., USA) and received a median dose of 46 Gy in daily 2.0-Gy fractions. Treatments were delivered stereotactically with a dedicated 600SR linear accelerator (Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Immobilization was achieved with the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame. The mean tumor size was 2.24 cm. The mean prescription isodose was 87%. The mean age was 53 years (10 male, 9 female). The mean follow-up time was 10 months (range 1-24 months). The mean optic chiasm and brain stem doses were calculated at 38 and 13 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postgadolinum-enhanced MRI scans and Humphrey visual field tests. RESULTS: In the posttreatment period, local control (absence of tumor progression) has been achieved in all of the patients. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. No acute complications, no visual changes and no T2-weighted MRI or proton density changes were documented in any of the 19 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that SRT compares favorably with conventional radiotherapy in achieving local control. The doses to the brainstem and the temporal lobes are significantly decreased and at early follow-up no white matter changes are seen on MRI after SRT. The true frequency of grade 1-4 changes are likely underestimated as similar changes often occur in association with tumor edema or after surgery. Given the uncertain neurocognitive significance of the white matter changes associated with treating these benign tumors by conventional radiotherapy, we are currently treating all pituitary adenomas with fractionated SRT to reduce the potential sequelae

The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy

Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings continue to support radiosurgery as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors that results in low rates of morbidity

From 1982, 65 patients have been treated (shortest follow-up 6 months). The dose was chosen according to the pathology and to the volume of the lesion. Good clinical results have been obtained in low-grade gliomas, acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and other selected types of intracranial lesions. Therapeutic effects in terms of clinical condition and size of the lesions have been plotted in relation to time elapsed and dose employed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose-volume histograms were compared between photon, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton plans at doses of 66 Gy, 87.5 Gy in Stage I (n=10) and 60-63 Gy, and 74 Gy in Stage III (n=15). RESULTS: For Stage I, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 31.8%, 24.6%, and 15.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 66 Gy, whereas they were 13.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, with proton with dose escalation to 87.5 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (p=0.002). For Stage III, the mean total lung V5, V10, and V20 were 54.1%, 46.9%, and 34.8%, respectively, for photon 3D-CRT with 63 Gy, whereas they were 39.7%, 36.6%, and 31.6%, respectively, for proton with dose escalation to 74 CGE (p=0.002). In all cases, the doses to lung, spinal cord, heart, esophagus, and integral dose were lower with proton therapy even compared with IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation, compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT

We sought to determine if MI levels correlate with cerebral astrocytoma grade. METHODS: Five control subjects, 14 patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 10 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent single-volume HMRS with an echo time of 20 ms. Twenty-five patients had received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy previously. Using the curve-fitting program supplied by the manufacturer, peak areas for n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and MI were normalized with respect to the peak area of creatine (Cr). Ratios for MI/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr were obtained for each lesion and retrospectively compared with the histologic grade of the lesion. RESULTS: Levels of MI/Cr were higher (0.82 +/- 0.25) in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, intermediate (0.49 +/- 0.07) in control subjects, and lower in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (0.33 +/- 0.16) and GBM (0.15 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a trend toward lower MI levels in the presence of anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs compared with those of low-grade astrocytomas. MI levels may have implications in the grading of cerebral astrocytomas

The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy were seen to be important prognostic factors. The following survival patterns were observed. In eight cases with limited plaque disease there was prolonged disease-free survival after treatment with kilovoltage X-rays; after a median follow-up of 64 months there was only one case of progression to generalized disease. In 49 cases of generalized skin disease (plaque disease +/- tumours; erythroderma) treated with total skin electron beam therapy there was a 24% 5-year disease-free survival; this potential for long-term survival was seen in cases with generalized plaque disease without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the cases showed a continuously relapsing course. The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy can both be used as known prognostic factors to adopt a logical plan of treatment

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

This is the first trial to investigate the utility of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the imaging of chordoma before and after carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with chordoma were investigated with MET-PET before and after CIRT and the findings analyzed visually and quantitatively. Tumor MET uptake was evaluated by tumor-to-nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). RESULTS: In 12 (80%) patients chordoma was clearly visible in the baseline MET-PET study with a mean T/N ratio of 3.3+/-1.7. The MET uptake decreased significantly to 2.3+/-1.4 after CIRT ( P<0.05). A significant reduction in tumor MET uptake of 24% was observed after CIRT. Fourteen (93%) patients showed no local recurrence after CIRT with a median follow-up time of 20 months. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that MET-PET is feasible for imaging of chordoma. MET-PET could provide important tumor metabolic information for the therapeutic monitoring of chordoma after CIRT	
0	1849	Potential role of intensity modulated proton beams in prostate cancer radiotherapy	Femur Head, Head, Humans, Male, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Risk, Switzerland, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, Urinary Bladder, X-Rays	PURPOSE: The present study was undertaken to assess the potential benefit of intensity modulated (IM) proton beams in optimizing the dose distribution to safely escalate the tumor dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four treatment plans were compared in a prostate cancer patient aiming to deliver 81 Gy to the target: 1) conformal 18 MV X-rays, 6-fields; 2) 214 MeV protons, 2-fields; 3) IM 15 MV X-rays, 5-fields; and 4) 177-200 Mev IM protons, 5-fields as in Plan 3. In addition, IM methods were used to further escalate the tumor dose to 99 Gy. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used to physically compare the treatment plans. DVH data were also used to obtain normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the rectum, bladder, femoral heads, and tumor control probabilities. RESULTS: Although the planning target volume dose distribution was satisfactory with the four treatment plans, the homogeneity was slightly reduced in both X-ray plans (IM and standard) and the low-to-medium doses delivered to all organs at risk, and other normal tissues were significantly reduced by both proton plans. For a prescribed dose of 81 Gy, only the IM X-ray and IM proton plans both succeeded in predicting an acceptably low NTCP for the rectum (<5%, Grade 3). The integral nontarget dose was significantly reduced with IM proton beams (i.e., 3.1, 1.3, and 1.7 times less than Plans 1, 2, and 3, respectively). When escalating the dose to 99 Gy, no additional improvement between IM protons and IM X-ray beams was observed. CONCLUSION: Both IM X-ray and proton beams were able to optimize the dose distribution and comply with the goal of delivering the highest dose to the target while reducing the risk of severe morbidity to acceptable levels. The main advantage compared to IM X-rays was that IM protons succeeded in significantly reducing the low-to-medium dose to the nontarget tissues and achieved a small improvement in planning target volume (PTV) dose heterogeneity

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

Twenty-six patients were randomized to neutrons, and 14 patients were randomized to photons. The randomization was purposefully unbalanced in favor of the experimental treatment. The complete response rate for the neutron-treated group of patients was 52%. The complete response rate for the photon-treated group of patients was 17%. The difference is statistically significant at the p = .04 level. The two-year survival rates for the neutron-treated group and the photon-treated group were 25 and 0%, respectively. The major complication rates were not statistically significantly different for the two groups (18% for neutrons, and 33% for photons)

METHODS: A patient experienced persistent unilateral panuveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. Inflammation and pressure worsened after cataract extraction and lens implantation. Diagnostic vitrectomy was non-revealing. RESULTS: Repeat vitrectomy and lens implant removal revealed a ciliary body mass, suggestive of melanoma. Ultrasonography and clinical evaluation by the retinal oncologists supported this diagnosis. The uveitis persisted despite aggressive medical treatments, including methotrexate. Proton beam irradiation of the melanoma led to resolution of uveitis and restoration of normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Ciliary body melanoma can present as chronic uveitis and refractory glaucoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2001 and February 2006, 59 patients with locally advanced or unfavorably located choroidal melanoma were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial of carbon-ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiologic Sciences. The primary endpoint of this study was normal tissue morbidity, and secondary endpoints were local tumor control and patient survival. Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 57 were followed >6 months and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (40%) developed neovascular glaucoma, and three underwent enucleation for eye pain due to elevated intraocular pressure. Incidence of neovascular glaucoma was dependent on tumor size and site. Five patients had died at analysis, three of distant metastasis and two of concurrent disease. All but one patient, who developed marginal recurrence, were controlled locally. Six patients developed distant metastasis, five in the liver and one in the lung. Three-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 88.2%, 84.8%, and 97.4%, respectively. No apparent dose-response relationship was observed in either tumor control or normal tissue morbidity at the dose range applied. CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy can be applied to choroidal melanoma with an acceptable morbidity and sufficient antitumor effect, even with tumors of unfavorable size or site

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas

Endoresection of the tumour after proton beam irradiation, is an alternative approach, aiming to reduce the incidence of ocular morbidity caused by tumour necrosis after sole radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with large uveal melanomas (mean tumour thickness: 9.1 mm, mean tumour volume: 0.77 cc), received a primary proton beam irradiation (60 CGE) and underwent subsequent endoresection via a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The median pretreatment visual acuity was 0.2. The mean follow-up was 13.9 months. RESULTS: The postoperative visual acuity after 12 months was 0.12 (median, mean visual acuity loss 0.08). The probability of developing radiation retinopathy or papillopathy within the first year after treatment was 35% and 28% respectively and the probability of enucleation was 9% within the first postoperative year. No tumour recurrences were observed and 2 patients developed liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Endoresection following irradiation of large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or the fovea seems to be a useful and safe alternative to the traditional irradiation or enucleation. The incidence of complications following our approach seems to be lower when compared to radiation alone, where tumour necrosis is a substantial problem	
1	743	Proton beam therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective review of 162 patients	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Liver, Liver Cirrhosis/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Palliative Care, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: We present results of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with proton beam therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed 162 patients having 192 HCCs treated from November 1985 to July 1998 by proton beam therapy with or without transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. The patients in the present series were considered unsuitable for surgery for various reasons, including hepatic dysfunction, multiple tumors, recurrence after surgical resection, and concomitant illnesses. The median total dose of proton irradiation was 72 Gy in 16 fractions over 29 days. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for all of the 162 patients was 23.5% at 5 years. The local control rate at 5 years was 86.9% for all 192 tumors among the 162 patients. The degree of impairment of hepatic functions attributable to coexisting liver cirrhosis and the number of tumors in the liver significantly affected patient survival. For 50 patients having least impaired hepatic functions and a solitary tumor, the survival rate at 5 years was 53.5%. The patients had very few acute reactions to treatments and a few late sequelae during and after the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC is effective, safe, well tolerable, and repeatable. It is the useful treatment mode for either cure or palliation for patients with HCC irrespective of tumor size, tumor location in the liver, insufficient feeding of the tumor with arteries, presence of vascular invasion, impaired hepatic functions, and coexisting intercurrent diseases	
1	3650	Conservative treatment of uveal melanoma: local recurrence after proton beam therapy	Adult, Boston, Cobalt, Eye, Female, Humans, Light Coagulation, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/th [Therapy], Particle Accelerators, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Time, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty-three of 1006 (2.3%) uveal melanoma patients treated with proton beam therapy at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between July 1975 and December 31, 1986 received additional treatment for documented (15 patients) or suspected (eight patients) tumor growth in the irradiated eye. Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related	
0	1454	Potential reduction of the incidence of radiation-induced second cancers by using proton beams in the treatment of pediatric tumors	Adolescent, Child, Humans, Incidence, Male, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/pc [Prevention & Control], Neoplasms,Second Primary/pc [Prevention & Control], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Switzerland, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To assess the potential influence of improved dose distribution with proton beams compared to conventional or intensity-modulated (IM) X-ray beams on the incidence of treatment-induced secondary cancers in pediatric oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1998, a total of 58 patients who could be evaluated were treated for skull base tumors, 33 for chordoma and 25 for chondrosarcoma. Following various surgical procedures, residual tumor was detected in 91% of patients; 59% demonstrated brainstem involvement. Target dosages ranged from 64.8 and 79.2 (mean 70.7) Co Gy equivalent. The range of follow up was 7 to 75 months (mean 33 months). In 10 patients (17%) the treatment failed locally, resulting in local control rates of 92% (23 of 25 patients) for chondrosarcomas and 76% (25 of 33 patients) for chordomas. Tumor volume and brainstem involvement influenced control rates. All tumors with volumes of 25 ml or less remained locally controlled, compared with 56% of tumors larger than 25 ml (p = 0.02); 94% of patients without brainstem involvement did not experience recurrence; in patients with brainstem involvement (and dose reduction because of brainstem tolerance constraints) the authors achieved a tumor control rate of 53% (p = 0.04). Three patients died of their disease, and one died of intercurrent disease. Actuarial 5-year survival rates were 100% for patients with chondrosarcoma and 79% for patients with chordoma. Grade 3 and 4 late toxicities were observed in four patients (7%) and were symptomatic in three (5%). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose proton RT offers excellent chances of lasting tumor control and survival, with acceptable risks. In this series all small- and medium-sized tumors with no demonstrable brainstem involvement have been controlled; all such patients are alive. Surgical debulking enhanced delivery of full tumoricidal doses, but even patients with large tumors and disease abutting crucial normal structures benefited	
0	2641	Evaluation of fixed- versus variable-modulation treatment modes for charged-particle irradiation of the gastrointestinal tract	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Biliary Tract Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Biophysics, California, Californium, Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Evaluation Studies as Topic, Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Ions, Kidney, Liver, Lung, Methods, Models,Structural, Neon, Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Probability, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skull Base, Universities	The clinical usefulness of variable-modulation dose delivery of neon ion and proton beams over fixed-modulation beams is evaluated for several patients with tumors in the gastrointestinal tract by comparing dose distributions, dose volume histograms, and predictions of normal tissue complication probabilities calculated with the two methods. Both techniques provide excellent coverage of the target volume with neon ion and proton beams. The advantage of variable modulation is that less dose is delivered proximal to the target volume. For tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, this implies that less dose is given to the liver, gut, kidneys, and lungs. For the ten patients considered in this study, variable-modulation reduced the total integral dose by an average of 17% for neon ion beams and by 18% for protons as compared to fixed-modulation. If the tumor volume is excluded, the reduction in the integral dose to normal tissues ranged from 15% to 32% for neon ions and from 18% to 34% for proton beams. These gains are larger than those anticipated on the basis of an analytic study by Goitein and Chen [Med. Phys. 10, 831-840 (1983)], which predicted integral dose reductions of the order of 10% for protons and 14% for neon ions. They are also larger than those reported in a similar study by Urie and Goitein [Med. Phys. 16, 593-601 (1989)] for proton irradiation of skull-base tumors. This is probably because the tumors in the GI tract considered in this study were more irregularly shaped than Goitein and Chen's analytic model assumes. The results of this study also suggest that due to increased sparing of normal tissues, the number of different portal directions required to achieve a satisfactory treatment plan will be reduced for variable-modulation beam delivery systems. This implies that variable-modulation treatment plans will be easier to execute than current fixed-modulation plans	
0	4217	Comparative treatment planning: proton vs. x-ray beams against glioblastoma multiforme	Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, X-Rays	The survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is extremely poor, the 5-year survival rate being almost zero. The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Grade 1 and 4 gliomas were excluded. Patients benefited from a 3D dose calculation based on high-definition CT and MRI, a stereotactic positioning using implanted fiducial markers and a thermoplastic mask. Mean tumor dose ranged between 63 and 67 Gy delivered in five weekly sessions of 1.8 Gy in most patients, according to the histological types (doses in Co Gy Equivalent, with a mean proton-RBE of 1.1). RESULTS: With a median 18-month follow-up (range: four-58 months), local control in tumors located in the envelopes and in the skull base was 97% (33/34), and in parenchymal tumors, 43% (6/14) only. Two patients (5%) presented with a clinically severe radiation-induced necrosis (temporal lobe and chiasm). CONCLUSION: In our experience, high-dose radiation combining photons and protons is a safe and highly efficient procedure in selected malignancies of the skull base and envelopes

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

This study, prompted by reports of transient (30% each) and permanent (10% each) facial and trigeminal neuropathy after stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas with marginal doses of 16-20 Gy, assessed whether proton beam radiosurgery using a marginal dose of only 12 Gy could control vestibular schwannomas while causing less neuropathy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 67 years) were treated between 1992 and 1998. The mean tumor volume was 2.49 cm(3). The dose to the tumor margin (70% isodose line) was 12 Gy. The prospectively specified follow-up consisted of neurologic evaluation and MRI at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: After a mean clinical follow-up of 44 months and imaging follow-up of 34 months in 64 patients, 35 tumors (54.7%) were smaller and 25 (39.1%) were unchanged (tumor control rate 94%; actuarial control rate 94% at 2 years and 84% at 5 years). Three tumors enlarged: one shrank after repeated radiosurgery, one remained enlarged at the time of unrelated death, and one had not been imaged for 4 years in a patient who remained asymptomatic at last follow-up. Intratumoral hemorrhage into one stable tumor required craniotomy that proved successful. Thus, 97% of tumors required no additional treatment. Three patients (4.7%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus evident as increased ataxia. Of 6 patients with functional hearing ipsilaterally, 1 improved, 1 was unchanged, and 4 progressively lost hearing. Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury

Series patients uniformly refused enucleation both at an outside institution and again as a treatment option after extensive discussion at the University of California, San Francisco. DESIGN: In a retrospective, nonrandomized cohort study, 21 patients with extra-large choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanomas measuring at least 10 mm in maximum thickness or 20 mm in maximum basal diameter or tumors located within 3 mm of the optic nerve measuring at least 8 mm in maximum thickness or 16 mm in maximum basal diameter met inclusion criteria. Main outcome measures were frequency of (1) anterior segment complications (lash loss, keratopathy, cataract, and neovascular glaucoma), (2) posterior segment complications (vitreous hemorrhage, radiation retinopathy, and radiation papillopathy), (3) treatment failure (tumor growth, enucleation, or metastases), and (4) final visual acuity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Mean age at treatment was 58.3 years. The frequencies of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 14.3% and 9.5%, respectively. Mean tumor thickness and mean basal diameter were 8.6 mm and 18.7 mm, respectively. Lash loss occurred in 52.4%; dry eye, in 23.8%; cataract, in 28.6%; neovascular glaucoma, in 38.1% (100% in patients with diabetes mellitus); radiation retinopathy, in 9.5%; and radiation papillopathy, in 9.5%. No patient developed radiation-associated scleral necrosis or vitreous hemorrhage. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of local tumor growth after treatment was 33%, and the rate of distant metastasis was 10%. Visual acuity of 20/200 or better was preserved in 25% of patients, including 4 patients (19%) who experienced an average of 4 lines of Snellen visual acuity improvement. Development of neovascular glaucoma was associated with tumors in close proximity to the optic nerve (P = .04), while cataract (P = .03) and lash loss (P = .02) occurred with more anteriorly located tumors. Proton beam radiotherapy provided a 67% probability of local control and 90% probability of clinically discernible metastases-free survival at 24 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy is an ocular-conserving option that may be considered for the treatment of extra-large uveal melanoma in carefully selected patients	
1	2268	[Presentation of a therapy scheme and irradiation technic for short-term contact irradiation of cervical cancer]. [German]	Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radium, Risk, Universities, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Since April 1983 patients with gynecologic tumors have been irradiated with the HDR afterloading method at the University Hospital of Cologne. The therapy scheme for the carcinoma of the cervix consists of a combination of intracavitary contact irradiation and external radiotherapy. Brachytherapy is preponderant in an early stage of tumor extension, whereas teletherapy contributes more to the total dose in advanced stages. At first, the pelvis is totally exposed to a homogenous irradiation, so the shrunken tumor can more easily be arrived by curietherapy. The therapy scheme is described for the different tumor stages with its dosages, fractionations, and treatment pauses. Besides the use of special multiple-way applicators, the risk organs are protected by collimating with a block the middle part of the external irradiation field as soon as the maximum permissible dose is reached. A special block shape minimizes the dose irregularities at the field borders. The total physical dose at point A is about 60 Gy. The high dose rate of HDR afterloading has to be considered when calculating the biologic efficient dose. Here the dose rate factor furnishes a rough relation to the established radium dosage

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

The ability to achieve high degrees of radiation dose conformity by using protons has resulted in higher radiation doses than can be delivered with conventional radiotherapy in the base of skull. High target volume doses have led to improved tumor control and patient survival. Side effects such as severe toxicity are acceptable considering the alternatives of uncontrolled tumor growth. The authors of various analyses have identified prognostic factors that can be used to predict a patient's chance of treatment success. On the horizon are important technical developments that will further increase dose conformity and increase target doses. In this paper the author reviews long-term outcome data and prognostic predictors for survival of patients with skull base chordomas based on the largest worldwide patient series. [References: 20]

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass 10 cm in diameter in the region of the middle clivus enhanced inhomogeneously by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and a defect in the skull base. There was evidence of compression of the anterior surface of the pons. He received proton irradiation employing a pair of parallel opposed lateral proton beams. The dose aimed at the tumor mass was 75.5 Gy, to the pharyngeal wall less than 38 Gy, and to the anterior portion of the pons less than 30 Gy. Time dose and fractionation factor was calculated at 148. Thirty-one months following treatment, he was free of clinical neurological sequelae. Proton therapy should be considered in treatment planning following initial surgical removal or for inoperable clivus chordoma

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

In this report, we present three patients with malignant liver tumors treated by proton beam therapy in whom pre- and post-therapeutic hepatic functional reserves were evaluated sequentially for more than a year by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. All three patients exhibited the distinctive time course of 99mTc-GSA uptake efficiency, which suggested a transient decline in the ratio of liver activity to heart and liver activity at 15 minutes (LHL15) 3-6 months after proton beam therapy. This change was not in parallel with that expected from a functioning normal liver tissue volume. In a year after proton beam therapy, LHL15 recovered nearly to the pre-treatment level in all three patients. Our observations may be related to the up-regulation of receptor-mediated 99mTc-GSA uptake during hepatic regeneration after proton beam therapy. [References: 27]

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR AMS. since 1983 using the synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. A "piercing" method with a proton beam of 12 mm in diameter (in one case 10 mm) was employed. Nine patients had unilateral anastomoses with the blood supply from branches of the internal and/or external carotid arteries, and one patient had a bilateral anastomosis. Irradiation was given in 2 fractions, in 2-3 days, the maximum total dose was 50-60 Gy. Regression of ophthalmological symptoms was noted 2-3 months after irradiation. Convalescence was noted in 8 patients, a follow-up period in 2 patients was insufficient. Of 7 patients examined by angiography complete thrombosis of the anastomosis was noted in 4, considerable reduction of the blood flow was noted in 3

We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

Our aim was to verify the possibility to deliver 66 Gy to the target, but less than 35 Gy to the small bowel, comparing different 3D irradiation techniques, in a selected group of patients. METHODS: Five patients with local recurrent rectal carcinoma were selected as representative of different presentations of the disease. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume were defined [by RS]. Tumors ranged between 182 and 540 cc, and small bowel volumes between 748 and 1050 cc. A three-field technique, coplanar multiple fields, noncoplanar fields and a proton beam were compared using dose volume histograms. A positive result was scored when > or = 90% of the target received the prescribed dose with no more than 5% of the small bowel receiving more than 35 Gy. Doses were escalated in steps of 2 Gy from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: The number of plans fitting the constraints were 7/19, 11/19, 18/19 for doses of 66 Gy, 64 Gy and 62 Gy, respectively. The stage of the tumor did not seem to correlate with the possibility to homogeneously cover the target with the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coplanar and complex coplanar techniques (up to six fields), positioning the patient in a prone position with dislocation of the bowel, seem to be the best solutions to treat almost all of the patients with doses of 64 Gy. Where higher doses are concerned, it is not possible to suggest a "standard" solution. More personalized techniques have to be tested to define the best option

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

Overall survival, local control, complications, and predictive parameters are analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with sacral chordomas were treated with the charged particles helium and neon between 1977 and 1989. The median dose was 7565 cGyE and the median follow up is 5 years. All patients were treated post-operatively; ten had gross residual disease. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival at 5 years is 85%. Overall 5-year local control is 55%. A trend to improved local control at 5 years was seen in patients treated with neon when compared to patients treated with helium (62% vs 34%), in patients following complete resection versus patients with gross residual tumor (75% vs 40%), and in patients who had treatment courses under 73 days (61% vs 21%). Distant metastases were seen in two patients (14%). No patient developed neurologic sequelae or pain syndromes. One previously irradiated patient required colostomy, one patient had delayed wound healing following a negative post-radiation biopsy, and one patient developed a second malignancy. There were no genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that post-operative charged particle irradiation of sacral chordomas appears to result in reasonable local control and survival with acceptable risk, and that additional evaluation on the use of heavy charged particles is warranted

The period of observation lasted from 6 mos. to 5 yrs. Irradiation was done using a multifield-convergent method and a proton beam of the ITEF synchrotron. The beam energy was 200 MeV, the beam diameter 7-15mm. Radiation response and immediate results were evaluated for all the patients. The least favorable results were noted in the patients with prolactinomas, for which, in addition to irradiation, parlodel therapy is needed. No marked radiation reactions, neurological complications and manifestations of hypopituitarism were observed with the chosen doses and schemes of irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1992 and April 1993, 74 patients received external beam radiation treatment to the prostate +/- nodes, generally with a four-field box technique. Forty-four of the 74 patients had a custom-made hemibody foam cast used in an attempt to improve setup accuracy. A review of the routine weekly port films was performed following the completion of therapy to determine the reproducibility of patient setup in all 74 patients. The physician's request of an isocenter shift was used as an indicator of reproducibility. Neither the treating technologists nor the physicians knew at the time the films were taken that the port films would be reviewed for setup reproducibility at a later date. The results were compared between the patients treated with (44) and without (30) an immobilization device. RESULTS: In the 44 immobilized patients, 213 routine checks of the isocenter were performed during the 7-week course of radiation therapy. In 17.4% of these instances (37 out of 213), an isocenter shift was requested. This rate is compared to 23.1% (30 out of 130) in the 30 patients who did not have the immobilization device (p < 0.2). There was a statistically significant reduction in isocenter shifts requested in the anterior to posterior direction in the patients who were immobilized, 5.1% (9 out of 175) vs. 12.6% (13 out of 103) (p < 0.05, two tailed chi-square test). There was no significant improvement in the reproducibility of isocenter placement in the cephalad to caudal or right to left directions. CONCLUSIONS: This custom-made hemibody foam cradle appears to improve the reproducibility of patient setup during the 7-week course of fractionated external beam irradiation for patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This type of immobilization device is now routinely used in our clinic and is recommended for all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. These devices are likely to be particularly useful when contemplating dose escalation to minimize the volume of bladder and rectum included in the treatment fields

High-resolution 3D T2-weighted fast spin echo (3D FSE) MRI scans were obtained for 60 consecutive ocular melanoma patients using a 1.5 T MRI (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), in a standard head coil. These patients were subsequently treated with proton beam therapy at the UC Davis Cyclotron, Davis, CA. The tumor was delineated by placement of tantalum rings (radio-opaque markers) around the tumor periphery as defined by pupillary transillumination during surgery. A point light source, placed against the sclera, was also used to confirm ring agreement with indirect ophthalmoscopy. When necessary, intraoperative ultrasound was also performed. The patients were planned using EYEPLAN software and the tumor volumes were obtained. For analysis, the tumors were divided into four categories based on tumor height and basal diameter. In order to assess the impact of high-resolution 3D T2 FSE MRI, the tumor volumes were outlined on the MRI scans by two independent observers and the tumor volumes calculated for each patient. Six (10%) of 60 patients had tumors, which were not visible on 3D MRI images. These six patients had tumors with tumor heights < or = 3 mm. A small intraobserver variation with a mean of (-0.22 +/- 4)% was seen in tumor volumes delineated by 3D T2 FSE MR images. The ratio of tumor volumes measured on MRI to EYEPLAN for the largest to the smallest tumor volumes varied between 0.993 and 1.02 for 54 patients. The tumor volumes measured directly on 3D T2 FSE MRI ranged from 4.03 to 0.075 cm3. with a mean of 0.87 +/- 0.84 cm3. The tumor shapes obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images were comparable to the tumor shapes obtained using EYEPLAN software. The demonstration of intraocular tumor volumes with the high-resolution 3D fast spin echo T2 weighted MRI is excellent and provides additional information on tumor shape. We found a high degree of accuracy for tumor volumes with direct MRI volumetric measurements in uveal melanoma patients. In some patients with extra large tumors, the tumor base and shape was modified, because of the additional information obtained from 3D T2 FSE MR images

Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been recognized as a clinicopathologic entity distinct from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapy, and prognosis of ESCC. METHODS: The medical records, from Jan. 1985 to Dec. 2005, of 53 patients with pathologically proved ESCC were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 39 were men and 14 were women, with the median age of 53 years (range, 27-76 years). Of the 53 cases of ESCC, 33 (62.3%) were detected in the esophagus, 5 in the cervix, 4 in the larynx, 3 in the pharynx, 2 in the upper sinus, 2 in the rectum and sublingual gland, 1 in the thyroid gland, 1 in the pleura, and 1 in the liver. Forty patients (75.5%) had limited disease (LD) and 13 (24.5%) had extensive disease (ED). Patients with ED mostly received platinum-based chemotherapy, for which the response rate was 69.2%. Patients with LD were treated with a variety of therapeutic modalities: 7 were treated with surgery plus radiochemotherapy, 3 with surgery plus radiotherapy, 18 with surgery plus chemotherapy, 6 with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, 4 with radiotherapy alone, and 2 with chemotherapy alone. The median survival time (MST) was 20 months for all patients, and the 1-and 3-year survival rates were 41.3% and 31.4%. MST for patients with ED and LD were 15 months and 26 months, respectively, and 1-and 3-year survival rates were 51.1% vs. 14.4%, and 42.5% vs. 0% (P=0.017 ). CONCLUSIONS: ESCC is identified in various sites, with the most common primary site being the esophagus. Multimodality therapy has become increasingly used for the majority of patients with LD-ESCC. Combination chemotherapy has been a major treatment for patients with ED-ESCC. Generally, the prognosis of LD-ESCC is significantly superior to ED-ESCC

The irradiated cohort consisted of 167 patients treated at the Donner Pavilion (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley), and the comparison cohort was the population evaluated in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR). Survival analyses were performed comparing the two cohorts using three different sets of matching criteria, each more restrictive than the previous analyses. The three different strategies were (1) matched only on severity of diabetic retinopathy; (2) matched on severity of retinopathy and age; and (3) matched on severity of retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status. Tests of comparison were the log-rank test, the Wilcoxon test, and the likelihood ratio test. For the model matching only on severity of retinopathy, mean survival was 8.3 years for the WESDR group and 9.4 years for the ablated group (p > 0.05 for all three statistical tests). For the model matched on retinopathy and age, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 9.2 years for the ablated group (p=0.05 log-rank test, 0.32 Wilcoxon test, and 0.06 likelihood ratio test). For the model matching on retinopathy, age, gender, and hypertension status, mean survival was 8.9 years for the WESDR group and 11.6 years for the ablated group (p=0.72 log-rank test, 0.08 Wilcoxon test, and 0.82 likelihood ratio test). These data are compatible with the notion that pituitary ablation, and therefore induced pituitary growth hormone deficiency, may not decrease survival in those with severe diabetic retinopathy

All patients referred to radiotherapy were treated by electron beam (10-15 MeV) and followed for more than 5 years. Postoperative radiotherapy after radical operation, with no macroscopic disease, was performed in 18 patients, 7 of whom were treated by radical re-operation and radiation of a recurrent parotid neoplasm. In these groups, the local recurrence rate was 4/18 (22%) and 2/7 (29%), the 5-year survival rate was 9/18 (50%) and 5/7 (71%). In 17 patients, radiotherapy started with gross tumor left behind. This group showed a local recurrence rate of 10/17 (59%) and a 5-year survival of 7/17 (41%). Treatment was well tolerated with no major sequelae. Local tumor control and its impact on survival is discussed	
1	3511	[Results of treatment of Itsenko-Cushing disease using proton irradiation of the hypophysis]. [Russian]	Adolescent, Adrenalectomy, Adult, Aged, Cushing Syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Pituitary Irradiation, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The application of protons (heavy charged particles) for irradiation of the pituitary body has some essential advantages over other types of teletherapy: insignificant destruction of surrounding tissues, a possibility of a single therapeutic session as well as the absence of post-radiation effects. Proton beam therapy was given to 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease aged 15 to 40. Mild cases were treated by proton beam irradiation only while severe cases were managed using proton beam therapy combined with unilateral adrenalectomy or oral administration of ortho-para-DDD. Catamnesis duration varied from 3 to 5 years. In most cases the exposure dose was 80-90 Gy (50-110 Gy). The procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. A dynamic multipolar converting method with 15-20 entrance poles in the left temporal area was employed (with the beam energy of 200 MeV). Stabilization of the course of disease and some clinical improvement were observed in most of the patients 3-4 months after proton beam therapy. In 6-36 months after irradiation 90% of the patients showed normal biochemical indices and the absence of any clinical signs of the disease. Three-five years after treatment, 94% of the patients were in steady remission. A 24-hour ACTH and cortisol normalization pattern was observed in all the patients in parallel with an increase in GH and gonadotropin secretion and a decrease in the prolactin level. Sex function renewal appeared to be the first clinical sign of remission. Young patients aged 15 to 20 with a short duration of disease reached remission faster than patients of the other age groups. Thus the results of proton beam therapy of 98 patients with Icenko-Cushing disease after a follow-up of 3-5 years showed a high efficacy of this type of treatment. The method can be used alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy as well as with oral administration of ortho-para-DDD

Radiation therapy has been used for patients who cannot be operated on for medical reasons or who have a tumor that is technically difficult to resect or that cannot be resected because of its location. We performed the present study to evaluate the efficacy of megavoltage radiation in terms of lack of tumor progression and treatment-related morbidity. METHODS: Twenty patients who had giant-cell tumor of bone were managed with a single course of megavoltage radiation (forty to seventy gray administered at 1.8 to 2.0 gray per fraction with an average total duration of treatment of five to seven weeks) between March 1973 and March 1992. We used megavoltage photons, 160-megaelectron-volt proton beams, or a combination of the two. RESULTS: After a median duration of follow-up of 9.3 years, the tumor had not progressed in seventeen of the twenty patients. Thus, the actuarial ten-year rate for lack of progression was 85 percent. Local regrowth was evident in one patient who had received radiation alone and in two of the thirteen patients who had been managed with partial resection and radiation. Operative treatment was successful in the three patients in whom the radiation treatment had failed. No radiation-induced tumors were observed in our series. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that giant-cell tumor of bone was effectively treated with megavoltage radiation in our series of twenty patients in whom operative resection would have been difficult or was not feasible. The rate of tumors that did not progress with this regimen of radiation is similar to that reported by investigators from several other centers. Furthermore, these results closely rival those obtained with modern curettage procedures. Malignant sarcomatous transformation was not observed in our series. A longer duration of follow-up of a larger group of patients is necessary to provide a better estimate of the risk of malignant transformation

DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 consecutive incident cases were treated at the Biomedical Cyclotron Centre (Nice, France) from June 1991 to December 1997. Overall, metastasis-free, local recurrence-free, and enucleation-free survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test. The multivariate prognostic analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 78.1% (SE: 3.7%). A largest basal tumor diameter (LTD) below 10 mm and female sex were independently associated with a better prognosis. The 5-year metastasis-free survival rate was 75.6% (SE: 3.6%). Only an LTD above 10 mm and ciliary body involvement were independently associated with metastasis. Ten patients (4.5%) had a local recurrence, which was correlated with the risk of metastasis (P =.045). The 5-year enucleation-free survival rate was 69.6% (SE: 4.0%). Once again, an LTD below 10 mm and female sex were predictive of a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our results with proton-beam therapy correspond to those reported in the literature. This treatment strategy is safe and yields predictably good results. In addition to the two independent prognostic factors for survival and metastasis, namely LTD and ciliary body involvement, sex also had a significant impact in our case series, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis with multivariate analysis using life tables and Cox proportional hazard models in addition to other nonparametric techniques. PATIENTS: All patients with a noncataractous other eye and adequate dosimetry data who were treated with helium ion irradiation. RESULTS: Significant cataracts (grade 3+ or 4+ on a 0 to 4+ scale) developed in 129 patients (44%). The risk of cataract development peaked at 3 years (25% per person-year) and then declined to a sustained level of 7% to 9% per year after 7 years. In multivariate analysis, the percentage of lens included in the treatment port was the predominant predictive correlate with time to significant cataract (relative risk of 2.97 for a 25% increase in the percentage of lens in the treatment port). Patient age, preexisting cortical opacity, and ultrasound tumor height were also significant; ciliary body involvement and tumor dose had smaller effects. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated an increased rate of cataractogenesis with each increment of the percentage of lens in the treatment port; when more than half of the lens was in the beam, the risk of cataract exceeded 90% within 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Cataract development after helium ion irradiation is a function of the amount of the lens in the beam. Unlike neovascular glaucoma that develops mainly in the first few years after treatment, cataract continues to develop during the entire length of follow-up

METHODS: The series consisted of a total of 92 eyes with uveal melanoma, enucleated at various intervals after proton irradiation (range, 1 month to 8 years) due to complications (n = 66) or tumor growth (n = 22), or at autopsy (n = 4). Study slides were read, using a standard protocol, by two pathologists masked to the timing of the enucleation after irradiation and the reason for the surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of inflammation decreased whereas fibrosis increased with time from 15% of cases enucleated within 12 months (early cases) to 61% of those enucleated more than 30 months (late cases) after irradiation (P for trend = 0.0005). Tumor necrosis and blood vessel damage occurred early, and the prevalence of these changes was constant over time. Excluding tumors with evidence of growth after irradiation, mitotic figures became progressively less common as the interval between irradiation and enucleation increased (P for trend = 0.015); no mitotic figures were present in 40 high-power fields more than 30 months after irradiation. CONCLUSION: Histopathologic changes in irradiated melanomas vary according to the time elapsed since irradiation. Inflammation decreases with time whereas fibrosis becomes more prevalent with time after irradiation. Among controlled tumors, mitotic figures appear only in recently irradiated tumors

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

The C-beams were more effective in the tumour growth inhibition than X-rays. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-beams against X-rays was 2.00. It was observed that the interactive hyperthermic (42 degrees C, for 30 min) enhancement of tumour regrowth delay by high-linear energy transfer (LET) C-beams was similar to that of combination of low-LET X-rays with hyperthermia. The thermal enhancement ratios (TER) were 6.10 and 5.57 for X-rays and C-beams, respectively. These results suggest that hyperthermic treatment is effective in radiotherapy not only by low-LET radiation but also by high-LET radiation such as C-beams. In conclusion, the depression of the tumour growth by the combined treatment of hyperthermia (42 degrees C) and the C-beams strongly suggests the available possible application of interdisciplinary cancer therapy for refractory tumours

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues

This total is made of 20 men and 17 women aged between 19 and 81 years with a mean age of 54.7 years. Tumors were localized in the bulbar conjunctival in 27 cases, in the palpebral conjunctival in 2 cases and were diffuse in 8 cases. Cornea was infiltrated in 19 cases. In 21 cases, the first treatment was made in our service and 16 cases were recurrences following a treatment made elsewhere. The mortality rate to 5 years was 20%. In a multivariant analysis using the COX Model, the height of the tumor was the only significant parameter (p = 0.035) for life expectancy. Recurrence of the tumor (p = 0.060) and presence of a PAM (p = 0.652) were not significant parameters. Benefits of cryocoagulation and indications for a proton beam irradiation are discussed

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications	
0	891	Preliminary assessment of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in predicting treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for relapse.[see comment]	Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm Staging, Physics, Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Radiation, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome	The purpose of the study was to determine whether 3D proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can predict treatment outcome in high risk patients with prostate cancer. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRSI were performed in 16 patients with prostate cancer who were considered high risk because of clinical stage T3-4, Gleason score>/=8, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL. Patients were treated with chemotherapy/hormone therapy, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, and were followed for PSA relapse (follow-up, 19-43 months). The ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate was used to localize peripheral zone cancer. An MRSI risk score on a scale of 0-3 was derived from the volume and degree of metabolic abnormality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging risk score, MRI tumor/node (TN) stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA were used as predictors of pathologic stage in patients treated with RP (n=10) and PSA relapse in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage (P<0.01) and MRSI risk score (P<0.05) correlated with pathologic stage, but clinical stage did not (P=0.35). Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage was the only significant predictor of PSA relapse in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). Although the MRSI risk score did not reach significance (P=0.13), 6 patients with a score<0.9 were relapse-free, whereas 7 of 10 patients with a score>0.9 relapsed. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI risk assessments agreed in 15 of 16 patients. These preliminary results suggest that tumor metabolic assessment may indicate treatment outcome in high-risk patients with prostate cancer. Although MRSI did not provide added prognostic value to MRI in this small number of patients, MRSI might increase the confidence of the clinician in assessing risk on MRI by contributing supporting metabolic data

We report the results in terms of local control, toxicity, and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with Grade 2/4 (n = 7) and Grade 3/4 (n = 13) gliomas according to the Daumas-Duport classification were treated on a prospective institutional protocol at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory between 1993 and 1996. Doses prescribed to the target volumes were 68.2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE, 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE) to gross tumor in Grade 2 lesions and 79.7 CGE in Grade 3 lesions. Fractionation was conventional, with 1.8 to 1.92 CGE once per day. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, biopsy-proven Daumas-Duport Grade 2/4 or 3/4 malignant glioma, Karnofsky performance score of 70 or greater, and supratentorial tumor. Median age of the patient population at diagnosis was 35.9 years (range 19-49). Ten tumors were mixed gliomas, one an oligodendroglioma. RESULTS: Five patients underwent biopsy, 12 a subtotal resection, and 3 a gross total resection. Median interval from surgery to first radiation treatment was 2.9 months. Actuarial 5-year survival rate for Grade 2 lesions was 71% as calculated from diagnosis (median survival not yet reached); actuarial 5-year survival for Grade 3 lesions was 23% (median 29 months). Median follow-up is 61 months and 55 months for 4 patients alive with Grade 2 and 3 patients alive with Grade 3 lesions, respectively. Three patients with Grade 2 lesions died from tumor recurrence, whereas 2 of the 4 survivors have evidence of radiation necrosis. Eight of 10 patients who have died with Grade 3 lesions died from tumor recurrence, 1 from pulmonary embolus, and 1 most likely from radiation necrosis. One of 3 survivors in this group has evidence of radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Tumor recurrence was neither prevented nor noticeably delayed in our patients relative to published series on photon irradiation. Dose escalation using this fractionation scheme and total dose delivered failed to improve outcome for patients with Grade 2 and 3 gliomas	
0	716	Dosimetric impact of geometric errors due to respiratory motion prediction on dynamic multileaf collimator-based four-dimensional radiation delivery	Fluoroscopy, Humans, Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Models,Theoretical, Motion, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Respiration, Time, Time Factors	The synchronization of dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) response with respiratory motion is critical to ensure the accuracy of DMLC-based four dimensional (4D) radiation delivery. In practice, however, a finite time delay (response time) between the acquisition of tumor position and multileaf collimator response necessitates predictive models of respiratory tumor motion to synchronize radiation delivery. Predicting a complex process such as respiratory motion introduces geometric errors, which have been reported in several publications. However, the dosimetric effect of such errors on 4D radiation delivery has not yet been investigated. Thus, our aim in this work was to quantify the dosimetric effects of geometric error due to prediction under several different conditions. Conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for a lung patient were generated for anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beam arrangements at 6 and 18 MV energies to provide planned dose distributions. Respiratory motion data was obtained from 60 diaphragm-motion fluoroscopy recordings from five patients. A linear adaptive filter was employed to predict the tumor position. The geometric error of prediction was defined as the absolute difference between predicted and actual positions at each diaphragm position. Distributions of geometric error of prediction were obtained for all of the respiratory motion data. Planned dose distributions were then convolved with distributions for the geometric error of prediction to obtain convolved dose distributions. The dosimetric effect of such geometric errors was determined as a function of several variables: response time (0-0.6 s), beam energy (6/18 MV), treatment delivery (3D/4D), treatment type (conformal/IMRT), beam direction (AP/PA), and breathing training type (free breathing/audio instruction/visual feedback). Dose difference and distance-to-agreement analysis was employed to quantify results. Based on our data, the dosimetric impact of prediction (a) increased with response time, (b) was larger for 3D radiation therapy as compared with 4D radiation therapy, (c) was relatively insensitive to change in beam energy and beam direction, (d) was greater for IMRT distributions as compared with conformal distributions, (e) was smaller than the dosimetric impact of latency, and (f) was greatest for respiration motion with audio instructions, followed by visual feedback and free breathing. Geometric errors of prediction that occur during 4D radiation delivery introduce dosimetric errors that are dependent on several factors, such as response time, treatment-delivery type, and beam energy. Even for relatively small response times of 0.6 s into the future, dosimetric errors due to prediction could approach delivery errors when respiratory motion is not accounted for at all. To reduce the dosimetric impact, better predictive models and/or shorter response times are required

The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR appearance of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome and to consider the underlying pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were compared with those of 11 patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. The two groups, both of which suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent 50-72 Gy of proton-beam irradiation during a period of 14-43 days. Examinations including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced imaging, and dynamic study were performed 3-10 weeks after the end of irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as a low-intensity area on T2-weighted images and on delayed phase images of dynamic study in the Budd-Chiari patients, and as iso- or high-intensity areas on both images in the patients without Budd-Chiari syndrome. US-guided needle biopsy from the irradiated area in one patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome revealed mostly necrotic tissue and fibrous tissue. CONCLUSION: These MR features of hepatic radiation injury in Budd-Chiari syndrome were considered to be due to severe hepatic fibrosis	
0	1939	Fractionated, three-dimensional, planning-assisted proton-radiation therapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: a novel technique	Biopsy, Boston, Child, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hypothalamus, Male, Massachusetts, Optic Chiasm, Orbit, Orbit/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/ra [Radiography], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Survivors, Temporal Lobe, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: Most children with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma will survive their disease. However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

These complex situations give rise to problems and inaccuracies in both dosimetry and analytical/empirical dose calculation, and therefore require other than conventional methods. A natural diamond detector and a Markus parallel plate ionization chamber have been selected for clinical dosimetry in 6 MV photon beams. Results of simulations using the Monte Carlo system BEAM/EGS4 to model the beam geometry have been compared with dose measurements. A modification of the existing component module for multileaf collimators (MLCs) allowed the modeling of a linear accelerator SL 25 (Elekta Oncology Systems) equipped with a MLC with curved leaf-ends. A mechanical measurement method with spacer plates and a light-field edge detection technique are described as methods to obtain geometrical data of collimator openings for application in the Monte Carlo system. Generally a good agreement is found between measurements and calculations of depth dose distributions and deviations are typically less than 1%. Calculated lateral dose profiles slightly exceed measured dose distributions near the higher level of the penumbras for a 10x2 cm2 field, but agree well with the measurements for all other cases. The simulations are also able to predict variations of output factors and ratios of output factors as a function of field width and field-offset. The Monte Carlo results demonstrate that qualitative changes in energy spectra are too small to explain these variations and that especially geometrical factors affect the output factors and depth dose curves and profiles

[Spanish]	Adolescent, Child, Child,Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Intraoperative Care, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Risk	Conventional external beam radiation has proved its profit in pediatric tumors; but its complications have limited it in therapeutical approach. Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1981 and 1988, 15 patients with craniopharyngioma were treated in part or entirely with fractionated 160 MeV proton beam therapy. The group consisted of 5 children (median age, 15.9 years) and 10 adults (median age, 36.2 years). Median dose prescribed to the tumor was 56.9 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE). The median proton component was 26.9 CGE. Patients were treated after documented recurrence after initial surgery (n = 6) or after subtotal resection or biopsy (n = 9). None had had prior radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median observation period of surviving patients (n = 11) was 13.1 years from radiotherapy. One patient was lost to follow-up with tumor control after 5.2 years. Actuarial 10-year survival rate was 72%. Four patients have died 5-9.1 years after treatment, two from local failure. Actuarial 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. The functional status of the living adult patients is unaltered from their preradiotherapy status; all of them continued leading normal or near normal working lives. None of the patients treated as a child had experienced recurrence of tumor. One child shows learning difficulties and slight retardation, comparable to his preradiotherapy status. The others have professional achievements within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Results in terms of survival and local control are comparable with other contemporary series. Although no formal neuropsychological testing was performed, the surrogate measures of lifestyle and professional accomplishments appear to be satisfactory

The tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density, and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing method

This study analyzes relapse and survival in a community-based population with L-SCLC according to age and comorbidity. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 174 patients with L-SCLC referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre, between January 1991 and December 1999. Patient and treatment characteristics, disease response, relapse, and survival were compared among three age cohorts: <65 years (n = 55, 32%), 65-74 years (n = 76, 44%), and > or =75 years (n = 43, 25%); and according to Charlson comorbidity scores 0, 1, and > or =2. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with treatment response and survival. RESULTS: Patient factors that significantly differed with age were functional status classified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and number of comorbidities. Increasing age was significantly associated with fewer diagnostic scans. Combined modality chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was given in 86%, 66%, and 40% of patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively, (p <0.0001). Thoracic irradiation use was comparable among the age cohorts (p >0.05), but chemotherapy use varied significantly with less intensive regimens, fewer cycles, and lower total doses with advancing age (p <0.05). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was used in 41 patients, only 3 of whom were age >70 years. Overall response rates to primary treatment significantly decreased with advancing age: 91%, 79%, and 74% in patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively (p = 0.014). Treatment toxicity and relapse patterns were similar across the age cohorts. Overall 2-year survival rates were significantly lower with advancing age: 37%, 22%, and 19% (p = 0.003), with corresponding median survivals of 17, 12, and 7 months among patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age and Charlson comorbidity scores were not significantly associated with treatment response and survival. Independent prognostic factors favorably associated with survival were good performance status, normal lactate dehydrogenase, absence of pleural effusion, and > or =four cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity. Older patients with L-SCLC were less likely to be treated with CRT, intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Treatment response and survival rates were lower with advancing age, but this may be attributed to poor performance status and suboptimal treatment rather than age. [References: 31]

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

Only radioresistant deeply localized metastases have been treated. Photon-irradiation was carried out with the convergent beam technique using stereotactic localization methods, in a linear accelerator facility. In 11 of the 12 patients no side effects occurred. The first 7 patients, who could be observed 3 months or longer, have been studied in detail. In each of these cases single dose irradiation with 20-30 Gy yielded arrest of tumor growth. In one case a marked decrease in contrast enhancement and in four cases shrinkage of the metastasis as well as a marked decrease of the edema occurred. In every patient a marked, sometimes dramatic improvement of the clinical condition was achieved, beginning a few days after irradiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a valuable tool in the treatment of inoperable, radioresistant brain metastases, the major advantage being high efficacy and smoothness of the procedure, as well as extremely short hospitalization times (2-3 days)

Cranial chordomas arise adjacent to critical neural tissues within the notochordal remnants in the clivus, frequently compromising adequate surgical removal of the primary tumor and making difficult the delivery of an adequate dose of radiotherapy. The optimal dose and fractionation have not been established. METHODS. The results of radiation combined with surgery, radiation alone, and surgery alone were compared based on the cases of 159 patients reported in the literature. An analysis of the optimal biologically equivalent doses (BED) was performed using the linear-quadratic formula on 47 patients. RESULTS. Past techniques using conventional photon irradiation have shown no dose-response relationship. Survival is improved for patients undergoing surgery followed by radiotherapy. CONCLUSION. Combined surgery and postoperative radiation is preferable to radiotherapy or surgery alone for management of cranial chordoma. Newer radiotherapeutic approaches will allow increased dose delivery to the target volume without an anticipated increase in radiation morbidity. It is believed that this will increase tumor control. Recent results of studies using charged particle therapy in cranial chordoma suggest that this may be an alternative way to optimize radiotherapy. [References: 49]

This paper characterizes proton MR spectroscopic findings of the temporal lobes and correlates them with imaging changes. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers (25 spectra) and 18 patients (28 spectra). All patients had biopsy-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and were previously treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment and 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method was used (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 135 ms) and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. Voxel size and geometry were adapted to the lesion to reduce skull-base lipid contamination. The metabolites were quantitated relative to water signal. For each location, an additional non-water-suppressed reference scan in fully relaxed conditions was performed. The imaging findings were divided into four categories: I, normal; II, edema only; III, contrast-enhancing lesions; and IV, cystic encephalomalacia. The N-acetyl-aspartate levels were reduced in 27 (96%) spectra. Choline was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. Imaging showed 4 (14%) spectra with category-I imaging findings; 5 (18%) spectra with category-II findings; 15 (54%) spectra with category-III findings; and 4 (14%) spectra with category-IV findings. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate in radiation-induced temporal lobe changes. Creatine levels were relatively more stable. Choline levels may be increased, normal, or reduced. Imaging findings ranged from normal to contrast-enhancing lesions and cystic encephalomalacia

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Proton-beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn-Meitner Institute after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved

Chordomas are uncommon primary malignant tumors of bone that typically occur in the axial skeleton including the sacrum, vertebrae, and skull base. The base of skull tumors usually are not amenable to complete surgical resection, and most require postoperative radiotherapy. The natural history of skull base chordoma is typified by slow locally invasive tumor progression and eventual death, although few parameters are known that allow stratification of patients into prognostic groups. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with skull base chordomas treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital by proton beam irradiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up information were reviewed in an attempt to identify clinical and pathologic parameters that predicted outcome. RESULTS. Female sex, tumor necrosis in preradiation treatment biopsy, and tumor volume in excess of 70 ml were each independent predictors of shortened overall survival after radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. CONCLUSIONS. Stratification of patients with skull base chordoma into poor and good outcome groups can be performed using the three parameters identified in our study. In addition, the striking difference in survival between the sexes suggests that further investigations of these tumors should include determination of their hormonal receptors status and consideration of hormonal manipulation in their management	
1	4744	Proton radiotherapy as an alternative to exenteration in the management of extended conjunctival melanoma	Adolescent, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Conjunctival Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Conjunctival Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Patients, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Diffuse and multifocal patterns of conjunctival melanoma may not be treatable with standard eye-sparing methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas

To be able to fully utilize the advantages of these techniques correct patient positioning is an important prerequisite. This study employing an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) investigated the positioning uncertainties that occur in the pelvic region for different patient positioning devices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 patients with prostate cancer were irradiated with or without rectal balloon/pelvic mask at a linear accelerator with multileaf collimator (MLC). For each patient multiple portal images were taken from different directions and compared to the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) of the treatment planning system and to simulation films (Table 1, Figure 1). RESULTS: In spite of different positioning devices, all patients showed comparable total positioning uncertainties of 4.0 mm (lateral), 4.5 mm (cranio-caudal) and 1.7 mm (dorso-ventral). The lateral positioning error was reduced for the pelvic mask patients while the cranio-caudal error increased (Table 2, Figure 2). A systematic and a random component sum up to the total positioning error, and a good estimate of the magnitudes of the two is possible from six to eight portal images (Figure 3). CONCLUSIONS: With a small number of portal images it is possible to find out the systematic and random positioning error of a patient. Knowledge of the random error can be used to resize the treatment margin which is clinically relevant since this error differs greatly for different patients (Figure 4). Image analysis with EPID is convenient, yet has some problems. For example, one only gets indirect information on the movement of the ventral rectum wall (Figure 5). The successful operation of positioning devices, although, needs further improvement--especially if one focuses on IMRT

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 394 1H MR spectra were acquired from 100 patients (age 19-74 years; mean and median age, 43 years) before and during 2 years after radiation therapy (the mean absorbed doses calculated for the averaged spectroscopy voxels are similar and close to 20 Gy). RESULTS: Oscillations were observed in choline-containing compounds (Cho)/creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and center of gravity (CG) of the lipid band in the range of 0.7-1.5 ppm changes over time reveal oscillations. The parameters have the same 8-month cycle period; however the CG changes precede the other by 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the oscillative nature of the brain response to irradiation, which may be caused by the blood-brain barrier disruption and repair processes. These oscillations may influence the NMR results, depending on the cycle phase in which the NMR measurements are performed in. The earliest manifestation of radiation injury detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the CG shift

METHODS: Among 249 patients with proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma, the authors identified 59 patients who had visual-field testing performed before treatment and at least 18 months after treatment. The visual fields, color fundus photographs, and charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of radiation papillopathy and visual-field loss after treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 59 patients reviewed (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of radiation papillopathy. Progressive visual-field loss, defined as enlargement of absolute scotoma of greater than [corrected] or equal to 30 degrees as compared with the pretreatment visual field, was noted in 67% of patients with radiation papillopathy and 73% of patients without papillopathy. In both groups, visual-field loss correlated with the area of the retina predicted to be exposed to irradiation in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive visual-field loss is common after proton irradiation for parapapillary choroidal melanoma. However, the scotoma usually correlates with the area of the retina exposed to irradiation. The development of radiation papillopathy does not appear to be associated with additional visual-field defects in most cases

METHODS: We studied the effects of interstitial brachytherapy on the brains of healthy monkeys and in humans with glioblastoma multiforme. The effects of radiation therapy on normal brain tissue in monkeys were assessed with sequential proton MR spectroscopic studies 1 week to 6 months after brachytherapy. Proton MR spectroscopy was also performed in five patients with residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (three of whom had radiation necrosis after brachytherapy), seven patients with newly diagnosed untreated glioblastoma multiforme, and 16 healthy volunteers, who served as a control group. RESULTS: In monkeys, the ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr) and the ratio of choline-containing compounds (Cho) to Cr of the reference point were significantly lower 1 week after brachytherapy than before treatment. The ratio of NAA to Cho of the irradiated area tended to be higher 1 week after brachytherapy than before irradiation. These peak metabolic ratios showed characteristic changes 6 months after treatment. In two of three monkeys, lipid signal was elevated 6 months after irradiation. In the clinical study, the ratio of NAA to Cho in the area of radiation necrosis was significantly different from that in glioblastoma multiforme when compared with the contralateral hemisphere after irradiation. In addition, lipid signal was detected in all patients with radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: It might be possible to use proton MR spectroscopy to differentiate radiation necrosis from residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme on the basis of comparisons with the contralateral hemisphere after radiation therapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability

Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

The proximity of both kidneys and the liver, and a more complex target configuration, can pose a dosimetric challenge for conventional X-ray treatment and intraoperative irradiation. We utilized proton radiation therapy (PRT) to reduce dose to uninvolved kidneys, liver, intestine, and spinal cord. PROCEDURE: A 4-year-old male underwent PRT for neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland, following chemotherapy and delayed surgical resection. Clinical target volume (CTV), boost volume, and normal structures were outlined on the 3D treatment planning CT scan. The patient received 25.2 CGE (cobalt Gray equivalent) to the CTV and 34.2 CGE to the boost region, using 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for target and nontarget structures. RESULTS: The 95% isodose volume enclosed CTV and boost volumes. The dose to 50% of the ipsilateral kidney, with tumor involvement of the medial renal surface, was < or = 16 CGE (47% of prescribed total dose). Doses to 50% and 20% of the contralateral kidney in close proximity to deep left-side, paraspinal soft tissue involvement were restricted to 1 CGE and 10 CGE, respectively. Eighty percent of the liver received 27 CGE (80% of prescribed dose). Using a patch technique, unique to charged particle therapy, the spinal cord was almost completely spared during boost volume irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: PRT can achieve excellent dose conformity for advanced retroperitoneal, paraspinal lesions, while respecting normal tissue tolerance levels. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc

It was shown that especially chronic side effects are benign in most of all cases. Severe - but not vitally dangerous - complications in bladder and intestine are rare (3%); their percentage corresponds roughly to the average mortality rate of surgical intervention (radical prostatectomy). Contrary to operation, troubles of the sexual function appear only in one third of the patients. Taking into consideration the similar therapeutic results of surgical intervention and radiotherapy, radiotherapy is more favorable with respect to side effects. This essential aspect should be considered when making a decision whether to apply a surgical or a radiotherapeutic treatment treatment

Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigated 106 tumors (27 ciliary body melanomas and 79 choroidal-ciliary melanomas) of patients treated between June 1983 and April 1998. Seventy-two patients were treated with 106-ruthenium applicators and 34 were treated with proton therapy. Some large tumors or recurrences required a second treatment. The mean follow-up period was 91 months. RESULTS: The mean tumor sizes before treatment were 6,6mm for melanoma thickness and 10.3mm for mean largest basal melanoma diameters (LTD). Of the patients studied, 71% were still alive at 5 years, 35% had metastasis and 27.7% developed recurrences. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for melanoma-related death were LTD greater than 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis, and choroidal-ciliary location. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With 71% of patients still alive at 5 years, this review shows that melanomas involving the ciliary body do not seem less severe than more posterior uveal tumors. Because of size differences between ciliary body melanomas and choroidal-ciliary melanomas, we cannot come to the conclusion that choroidal-ciliary melanomas have a poorer prognosis than ciliary body melanomas. Largest tumor diameter over 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, and macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis are important risk factors for melanoma-related death, as shown by the multivariate analysis

Functional imaging of tumor metabolism can help with this task, but the choice of tracer is still controversial. This prospective study following up irradiated low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) was, to our knowledge, the first receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis that intraindividually evaluated the diagnostic performance of the SPECT tracers 3-[(123)I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT) and (99m)Tc(I)-hexakis(2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile) (MIBI) and the PET tracer (18)F-FDG. METHODS: We examined 17 patients, initially with histologically proven LGA and treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, who presented with new gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhancing lesions (n = 26) on MRI. At that time, MRI could not differentiate between progressive tumor and nonprogressive tumor. This MRI examination was closely followed by (18)F-FDG PET and by (99m)Tc-MIBI and (123)I-IMT SPECT. Lesions were classified as progressive tumor (n = 17) or nonprogressive tumor (n = 9) on the basis of prospective follow-up (through clinical examination, MRI, and proton MR spectroscopy) for 26.6 +/- 6.6 mo after PET or SPECT. RESULTS: (123)I-IMT yielded the best ROC characteristics and was the most accurate for classification, with an area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.991. The A(z) of (18)F-FDG (0.947) was not significantly lower than that of (123)I-IMT. The difference in the A(z) of (99m)Tc-MIBI (0.713) from the A(z) of the other tracers used in our study was highly significant (P </= 0.01). (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of low accuracy and, especially, of poor sensitivity even at modest specificity values. CONCLUSION: (123)I-IMT SPECT imaging of amino acid transport accurately detects tumor progression in patients with irradiated LGA. In contrast to (123)I-IMT, (18)F-FDG PET was slightly less accurate for classification, and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was of limited value. Imaging of amino acid transport with (123)I-IMT is a valuable additional tool for the follow-up of LGA, allowing early, noninvasive differentiation of lesions with ambiguous morphology after irradiation

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

Three-dimensional conformation of the treatment volume to the target volume can thus be achieved. Following previously reported Phase I and Ib clinical trials, a Phase II trial was initiated with the goal of treating primary deep-seated tumors in a dose optimization schedule which included stepwise increase of total pion dose and of target volume. Patients with multicentric superficial bladder tumors who were cystectomy candidates were initially selected. Since then, more invasive cases have been treated. A graded scoring of acute tissue reactions was employed. Follow-up periods were from 10 to 20 months. The pion dose escalation ranged from 3000 rad (minimum) to 3600 rad (minimum) in 20 fractions over 5 weeks. The treatment volumes encompassed 190 cc for local to 1,820 cc for extended volume therapy. Treatment reactions ranged from a faint erythema and increase of bladder frequency to dry desquamation, mild nausea, moderate dysuria, and moderate proctitis or diarrhea with mucus. These reactions were closely related to treatment volume and site. One severe late cystitis has occurred in a patient treated with 2 courses of pions (4475 rad). Mild to moderate late proctitis has been seen in 4 patients. Ten of 13 bladder cancer patients had local control of disease while all 3 pancreas or biliary tract cancer patients had microscopic residual disease locally at time of death from metastasis. A total of 11 of 17 patients are thus clinically or pathologically free of local tumor to time of last observation

Prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck is a criterion of treatment for these patients. But some authors suggest to prophylactically irradiate the the whole neck. This study was to analyze and compare long-term outcomes of the N0-NPC patients treated by prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck and to the whole neck, and explore radiotherapy on neck for N0-NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 178 N0-NPC patients, proved by pathology, were treated in our hospital from Jul. 1998 to Dec. 1999. Of the 178 patients, 88 received prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck (upper neck group), 90 received prophylactic irradiation to the whole neck (whole neck group). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze and compare survival rate of the 2 groups. Cox model was used to study prognostic factors of N0-NPC. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 90.9%, and 80.7% in upper neck group, and 97.8%, 80.0%, and 71.1% in whole neck group (P = 0.224). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 93.2%, 80.7%, and 77.3% in upper neck group, and 85.6%, 68.9%, and 64.4% in whole neck group (P = 0.163). The incidence of cervical lymph nodes recurrence was 1.14% in upper neck group, and 1.09% in whole neck group (P> 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, and short-term outcome were independent prognostic factors of N0-NPC. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic irradiation to upper neck is recommended for N0-NPC patients

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

One day after the completion of therapy, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, headache, and postural hypotension. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a marked fall of the previously elevated urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) and undetectable plasma cortisols. The urinary 17-OHCS transiently returned to supranormal levels but over a 2 1/2-week period decreased and then remained low. The patient also demonstrated a subnormal urinary aldosterone excretion in relation to plasma renin activity (PRA) during 10 mEq/24 h sodium restriction. The remainder of the endocrine evaluation was normal, suggesting that pituitary function otherwise remained intact. One and one-half years after alpha-particle therapy, the patients's urinary 17-OHCS were normal and responded normally to metyrapone. The relationship between urinary aldosterone excretion and PRA also was normal. It is postulated that there was an infarction of an ACTH secreting pituitary tumor leaving the remainder of the pituitary intact. Achronically elevated circulating level of ACTH with sudden loss of ACTH secretion appeared to have been responsible for the initial low urinary aldosterone as well as the low urinary 17-OHCS. This is the first reported case of a presumed pituitary tumor infarction in association with alpha-particle pituitary radiation

METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment

[Review] [71 refs]	Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Cyclotrons, Extremities, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Massachusetts, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Sarcoma,Ewing's/rt [Radiotherapy], Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Synchrotrons	BACKGROUND: For patients with sarcomas, radiotherapy can be used as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or primary local therapy, depending on the site and type of sarcoma, the surgical approach, and the efficacy of chemotherapy. METHODS: The authors review the current status of advanced technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. RESULTS: Advances in radiotherapy have resulted in improved treatment for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses modifications in the intensity of the photon-beam from a linear accelerator across the irradiated fields to enhance dose conformation in three dimensions. For proton-beam radiation therapy, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are accelerated in cyclotrons or synchrotrons, extracted, and transported to treatment rooms where the proton beam undergoes a series of modifications that conform the dose in a particular patient to the tumor target. Brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy have generally been used to treat microscopic residual disease in patients with sarcomas. These technologies deliver dose to tumor cells with irradiation of limited volumes of normal tissue. Patients who may benefit from technically advanced radiotherapy include those with skull base and spine/paraspinal sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and retroperitoneal/extremity sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in radiation therapy technology, particularly IMRT, proton-beam or other charged-particle radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and intraoperative radiation therapy, have led to improved treatment for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

0	4492	Macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation. 10-year follow-up observation with histopathologic correlation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/pa [Pathology], Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Risk, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Although patients with choroidal melanoma within 3 mm of both the optic nerve and fovea are at higher risk for visual loss after proton beam irradiation, half of the patients in this study with visual acuity better than 20/200 before treatment maintained this level of vision for at least 2 years. Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation	
1	4751	Proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma	Adult, Aged, Cataract, Ciliary Body, complications, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Glaucoma, Humans, Iris Neoplasms, Male, Melanoma, Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, pathology, Patients, Proportional Hazards Models, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation Effects, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Research, surgery, therapeutic use, therapy, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Visual Acuity	PURPOSE: To report on outcomes after proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1993 and 2004, 88 patients with iris melanoma received proton beam radiotherapy, with 53.1 Gy in 4 fractions. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 52 years and a median follow-up of 2.7 years. The tumors had a median diameter of 4.3 mm, involving more than 2 clock hours of iris in 32% of patients and more than 2 hours of angle in 27%. The ciliary body was involved in 20%. Cataract was present in 13 patients before treatment and subsequently developed in another 18. Cataract had a 4-year rate of 63% and by Cox analysis was related to age (p = 0.05), initial visual loss (p < 0.0001), iris involvement (p < 0.0001), and tumor thickness (p < 0.0001). Glaucoma was present before treatment in 13 patients and developed after treatment in another 3. Three eyes were enucleated, all because of recurrence, which had an actuarial 4-year rate of 3.3% (95% CI 0-8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam radiotherapy of iris melanoma is well tolerated, the main problems being radiation-cataract, which was treatable, and preexisting glaucoma, which in several patients was difficult to control

Because few data exist about the clinical course of irradiated patients, we reviewed the 17 patients treated at our institution since 1982. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 47 to 88 years). Twelve patients presented with lymph node involvement (Stage II), 5 patients with negative lymph nodes (Stage I). Five patients were irradiated immediately after initial surgical excision of the primary tumor. Eleven patients underwent a surgical treatment of recurrence prior to the first irradiation. Only 1 patient received primary radiotherapy. A median dose of 52.8 Gy (range 40 to 60 Gy) in the region of the primary tumor and a median dose of 49.5 Gy (range 30 to 54 Gy) in the regional lymph nodes were delivered. RESULTS: The median overall survival after first diagnosis was 45 months. Three-year overall survival was 57%, 5-year cause-specific survival was 73% (Kaplan Meier). Local control could be achieved in the 5 patients irradiated immediately after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. In contrast, an in-field recurrence occurred in 5 of 12 patients irradiated after surgical excision of relapsed disease. Five patients developed distant metastases. None of these patients was irradiated immediately after surgical excision of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our experience, a local control can be achieved with an immediate postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor site and the adjacent lymph nodes

Although they do not usually show cytological atypia, metastases have been reported in 30 per cent of cases. Survival rates in cases of skull base locations are low, and local recurrence is common after local excision. Radiation therapy is used in post-operative treatment and proton radiation therapy as the primary treatment. In the present paper we present the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian man affected by chordoma of the clivus, with liver and chest metastases, relapsed after several surgical local excisions, to discuss improvements in therapeutic and imaging techniques. Indium111 (In111) pentetreotide single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed to assess the presence of somatostatin receptors and to treat the tumour with radiolabelled Y90-DOTA-lanreotide. Imaging, performed 2 months afterwards, showed stable disease in the lungs but a local progression in the metastases, in comparison with pre-treatment uptake. These data suggest the usefulness of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues in the diagnosis and therapy of chordomas

No patient demonstrated tumor enlargement, and most lesions followed for more than five months have demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Heavy charged particle irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity associated with it in either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation	
0	4706	Gemcitabine-related radiation recall in a patient with pancreatic cancer	Antimetabolites,Antineoplastic/ae [Adverse Effects], Breast, Combined Modality Therapy, Connecticut, Deoxycytidine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives], Deoxycytidine/ae [Adverse Effects], Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Hematocrit, Humans, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Physical Examination, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/pp [Physiopathology], Time, Universities	Radiation recall refers to inflammatory reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents and develops cutaneously in the previously irradiated areas. Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

METHODS: We followed prospectively 1,922 patients treated at the Harvard Cyclotron between January 1975 and December 1996 for local recurrences of their tumors. Mortality surveillance was completed through June 1999. For analysis, patient follow-up continued until tumor regrowth was detected or, in patients without recurrence, until the date of the last dilated examination prior to April 1998. Actuarial methods were used to calculate rates of recurrence and metastatic deaths. Cox regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for these outcomes. RESULTS: Median ocular follow-up after irradiation was 5.2 years. Local recurrence was documented in 45 patients by ultrasound and/or sequential fundus photographs; in 17 more patients, the eye was enucleated due to suspected but unconfirmed tumor growth. Recurrences were documented between 2 months and 11.3 years after irradiation. The 5- and 10-year rates of regrowth, including suspected cases, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5%-4.2%), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among the 45 documented recurrences, about one half (21) occurred at the margin, presumably due to treatment planning errors. The remaining cases represented extrascleral extensions (nine cases), ring melanomas (six cases), or uncontrolled tumor (nine cases). Recurrence of the tumor was independently related to risk of tumor-related death. CONCLUSION: These data, based on relatively long-term follow-up, demonstrate that excellent local control is maintained after proton therapy and that patients with recurrences experience poorer survival

From December 1984 to December 1989, 100 patients were treated 86 of them are now evaluable. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range: 9-69). Surgery was abdomino-perineal resection in 33 cases and anterior resection in 53 cases. Radiotherapy was preoperative pelvic irradiation, with a single 500-Gy fraction, the day before surgery. To stages B2, C1 and C2 patients (Astler and Coller) postoperative radiotherapy was administered for a total dose of 4500 Gy (180 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/week), with box technique, from a Co 60 unit or Linear Accelerator (photon 18 MV). Preliminary results indicate 8% (7/86) local recurrences and 9.3% (8/86) distant metastases. Five-year actuarial disease-free survival is 63.2% +/- 8 for stage B1, 55.6% +/- 19 for stage B2, and 40.2% +/- 13 for stages C1 + C2. Overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 53% +/- 10. No lethal or severe complications were observed following treatment

At 37.80 Gy, fields were reduced and a final tumor dose of 59.40 Gy in 33 fractions given in three and a half weeks. Fifty-six percent of patients had complete resolution of tumor; the overall local control rate was 52% with an average follow-up of 12.5 months. Actuarial survival was 74% at 12 months and 50% at 24 months. Disease-free survival was 48% at 12 months and 32% at 24 months. Acute complications were common, but late complications were rare, two cases of asymptomatic subcutaneous fibrosis. Radiation therapy with accelerated fractionation shows promise of improving the therapeutic ratio

Forty of these 45 patients received at least 6000 cGy. The 5 and 10 year actuarial survival rates were 31 and 20%. Four patients are currently alive without evidence of disease at least 10 years after treatment. Local persistence or recurrence of tumor in the nasopharynx was the primary cause of failure and occurred in 42% of our patients. The likelihood of this type of treatment failure correlated with the initial "T stage" of disease. Inability to control nodal disease was less common, occurring in 23% of evaluable patients and was proportional to the "N stage." Distant metastases became apparent in 13% of our patients and correlated with the "N stage." More than 90% of recurrences were evident within two and all occurred within three years of treatment	
0	1029	Quantification of volumetric and geometric changes occurring during fractionated radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer using an integrated CT/linear accelerator system	Adult, Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/dt [Drug Therapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Head and Neck Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lymph Nodes/pa [Pathology], Lymph Nodes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Middle Aged, Parotid Gland/pa [Pathology], Parotid Gland/re [Radiation Effects], Particle Accelerators, Pilot Projects, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Texas, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Weight Loss	PURPOSE: Many patients receiving fractionated radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer have marked anatomic changes during their course of treatment, including shrinking of the primary tumor or nodal masses, resolving postoperative changes/edema, and changes in overall body habitus/weight loss. We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT	
0	4077	Definitive proton beam radiation therapy for inoperable gastric cancer: a report of two cases	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Japan, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Stomach Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Stomach Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach Ulcer/di [Diagnosis], Stomach Ulcer/pa [Pathology], Stomach/pa [Pathology], Universities	Proton beam radiation therapy using 250 MeV protons was carried out on two patients with early gastric cancer (T1, N0, M0). One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers	
1	2152	Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Brain Stem, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Sex Factors, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Time	PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume	
1	2044	The phase I/II clinical study of carbon ion therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix	Adenocarcinoma, Adult, Aged, Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Female, Heavy Ions/ae [Adverse Effects], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Pelvis, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: The phase I/II clinical study of carbon beam therapy was undertaken for 31 cases of advanced cervical cancer of stages IIIB and IVA from June 1995 to November 1997. The main purpose was to determine clinically useful fraction doses without severe acute reaction of normal tissues and to assess tumor control dose levels achievable without significant normal tissue toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment was given with four fixed fractions per week (24 fractions over 6 weeks) and was initiated with a fraction dose of 2.2 Gray equivalent (GyE), and the dose was increased as 2.4 GyE, 2.6 GyE, 2.8 GyE, and 3.0 GyE. Consequently, the total dose initiated was 52.8 GyE, to increase up to 72.0 GyE in 4.8-GyE increments in the dose-escalation fashion. Thirty patients with eligible advanced cervical cancers consisting of 27 squamous cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas were analyzed. RESULTS: Acute response of normal tissues was less than with photon treatment until fraction doses of 2.8 GyE were administered, and patients finished treatment with comfortable conditions. Severe late complications occurred in the two patients who received more than 67.2 GyE. The 2-year cumulative survival rate and the local control rate of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were 61.5% and 59.3%, respectively. According to stages, the 2-year survival rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 54.4% and 75.0%, respectively. The 2-year local control rates of stage IIIB and IVA patients were 52.6% and 75.0%, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results indicated that the disease control seems to be relatively better for very advanced disease and with dose escalation treatment. Local control was not significantly correlated with total dose and tumor volume. The results of the present study, despite small numbers and short observation, suggest that an adequate fraction dose for pelvis fields is 2.8 to 3.0 GyE and that the carbon beam therapy might be advantageous for advanced cervical cancer	
0	3435	Role of stereotactic radiosurgery with a linear accelerator in treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children	Adolescent, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cerebral Angiography, Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Massachusetts, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Stereotaxic Techniques/is [Instrumentation], Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Between 1986 and 1988, 16 children were treated for 10 arteriovenous malformations and 6 recurrent intracranial tumors with stereotactic radiation therapy using a modified Clinac 6/100 linear accelerator. The median age of our patients was 10.5 years. For the group with arteriovenous malformation, follow-up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (median was 20 months). No patient bled during the follow-up period. Five of eight patients with follow-up longer than 12 months have achieved complete obliteration of their arteriovenous malformation by angiogram. The four remaining patients who have not achieved a complete obliteration are awaiting their 2-year posttreatment angiogram. The other patient has been treated within the year and have not yet been studied. Five of the six recurrent tumor patients are alive with a median follow-up of 8 months. The remaining patient was controlled locally, but he died of recurrent disease outside the area treated with radiosurgery. The radiographic responses of these patients have included three complete responses, two substantial reductions in tumor volume (greater than 50%) and one stabilization. Despite previous radiotherapy, there have been no significant complications in these patients. We conclude that stereotactic radiation therapy using a standard linear accelerator is an effective and safe technique in the treatment of selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children. In addition, stereotactic radiosurgery may have unique applications in the treatment of localized primary and recurrent pediatric brain tumors	
0	699	Economic evaluation of proton radiation therapy in the treatment of breast cancer	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/ec [Economics], Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cost-Benefit Analysis, Female, Health Care Costs/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Humans, Markov Chains, Middle Aged, Models,Economic, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Radiation, Radiotherapy/ec [Economics], Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sweden	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton beam therapy offers potential clinical advantages compared with conventional radiation therapy for many cancer patients. The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy

No patient demonstrated tumor enlargement, and most lesions followed for more than five months have demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Heavy charged particle irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity associated with it in either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment	
0	4513	Choroidal melanomas near the optic disk or macula. Long-term results after proton beam irradiation: a report of 3 cases	Adult, Austria, Blindness/et [Etiology], Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Optic Disk, Optic Disk/re [Radiation Effects], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Time, Universities	Three patients with choroidal melanomas of the posterior pole were treated with proton beam irradiation. One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now	
0	4492	Macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation. 10-year follow-up observation with histopathologic correlation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Macula Lutea/pa [Pathology], Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Reading, Risk, Vision, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Although patients with choroidal melanoma within 3 mm of both the optic nerve and fovea are at higher risk for visual loss after proton beam irradiation, half of the patients in this study with visual acuity better than 20/200 before treatment maintained this level of vision for at least 2 years. Findings at a 10-year follow-up examination of a patient with macular uveal melanoma treated with proton beam irradiation are presented. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman with macular uveal melanoma in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye was treated with proton beam irradiation and evaluated for 10 years. The clinical course and histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS: The patient had optic atrophy in the fellow eye with visual acuity of 20/200, but maintained reading vision with the irradiated eye until she died of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic examination of the tumor-bearing eye showed a pigmented choroidal mass involving the macula. The mass consisted of plump spindle-shaped cells with small nuclei and indistinct nucleoli and a large number of pigment-laden macrophages. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that long-term useful vision can be preserved in patients afflicted with macular uveal melanoma after proton beam irradiation	
0	178	Assessment of the micronucleus assay as a biological dosimeter using cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes from cancer patients receiving fractionated partial body-radiotherapy	Adult, Aged, Cell Division/re [Radiation Effects], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Gamma Rays, Humans, Lymphocytes/cy [Cytology], Lymphocytes/pa [Pathology], Lymphocytes/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Micronucleus Tests, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Reference Values, Research, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	PURPOSE: To assess the suitability of the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay as a biological dosimeter following in-vivo radiation using cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. METHODS: Blood from 4 healthy donors was irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays and the dose response of induced micronuclei in binucleate lymphocytes following cytokinesis block was determined. Micronucleus frequency was ascertained before and at intervals during radiotherapy treatment in 6 patients with various tumors in the pelvic region. Equivalent whole body doses (physical doses) at these times were calculated from radiation treatment plans and cumulative dose volume histograms. RESULTS: Linear dose response relationships were found for induced micronucleus frequency in lymphocytes resulting from both in-vitro and in-vivo irradiation. Doses resulting from in-vivo irradiation (biological doses) were estimated by substitution of micronucleus frequency observed in radiotherapy patients into the dose response curve from in-vitro irradiation of blood. The relationship between the biologically estimated dose (BD) and the calculated equivalent whole body dose (PD) was BD = 0.868 (+/- 0.043)PD + 0.117 (+/- 0.075). CONCLUSION: The micronucleus assay appears to offer a reliable and consistent method for equivalent whole body radiation dose estimation, although our findings should be confirmed using lymphocytes from radiotherapy patients with tumors at anatomical sites other than the pelvis. Except at doses lower than about ).4 Gy, the method yields dose estimates acceptably close to "true" physically determined doses. The assay can be performed relatively rapidly and can be used as a "first line" biological dosimeter in situations where accidental exposure to relatively high radiation doses has occurred	
0	4304	Preliminary results in heavy charged particle irradiation of bone sarcoma	Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/tu [Therapeutic Use], Bone Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Bone Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain, California, Californium, Helium, Humans, Ions, Neon, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Research, Sarcoma, Sarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Sarcoma/mo [Mortality], Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Time, Treatment Failure, Universities	Between 1979 and 1989, 17 patients with unfavorable bone sarcoma were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particle irradiation (helium and/or neon ions) at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT	
1	4744	Proton radiotherapy as an alternative to exenteration in the management of extended conjunctival melanoma	Adolescent, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy, Conjunctival Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Conjunctival Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Patients, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Diffuse and multifocal patterns of conjunctival melanoma may not be treatable with standard eye-sparing methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton beam radiation therapy as an alternative to exenteration. METHODS: Twenty patients with extended conjunctival melanoma were treated by proton beam irradiation. Most cases were T3 tumours which were not accessible to brachytherapy due to their extension, localisation with fornical or caruncular involvement. Only 2 patients had a tumour limited to the bulbar conjunctiva. Both were recurrent tumours with multiple lesions. Sixteen cases were recurrences after various pre-treatments. The area of the conjunctiva which was suspected to have microscopic disease was treated by 31 Gy in 6 fractions. The "high risk" areas with a clinically detectable tumour (primary target volume) were treated by an additional boost using a smaller beam size and applying 2 fractions up to 45 Gy. An individually shaped compensator was brought into the beam to modify the range of the protons so that the eye was irradiated only at a depth of 2 mm. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 38.1+/-26.6 months (median 34 months). Recurrent disease occurred in 6 cases (30%); 2 of them outside the irradiated volume, 3 within the target volume treated by 31 Gy, and just one in the primary target volume treated by 45 Gy. An exenteration followed only in two patients (10%). 6 patients (30%) suffered from metastatic disease and 4 (20%) of them have died by now. During follow up we found no statistically significant association between the occurrence of local recurrence after proton radiotherapy and the development of metastases. Best corrected visual acuity remained stable in 12 cases (60%); in 14 patients the best corrected visual acuity was 0.25 or better. A sicca-syndrome developed in 19/20 patients. However, only 10/20 patients used artificial tears more than 5x/d. A focal cataract developed in 7 patients (35%). There was eyelash loss in the area of irradiated eyelids. In 4 cases a limbal stem cell deficiency occurred with the consequence of corneal vascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiotherapy may serve as an alternative to exenteration in case of T3 and diffuse T1 or T2 conjunctival melanomas	
0	891	Preliminary assessment of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in predicting treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for relapse.[see comment]	Disease-Free Survival, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neoplasm Staging, Physics, Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Radiation, Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome	The purpose of the study was to determine whether 3D proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can predict treatment outcome in high risk patients with prostate cancer. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRSI were performed in 16 patients with prostate cancer who were considered high risk because of clinical stage T3-4, Gleason score>/=8, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL. Patients were treated with chemotherapy/hormone therapy, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, and were followed for PSA relapse (follow-up, 19-43 months). The ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate was used to localize peripheral zone cancer. An MRSI risk score on a scale of 0-3 was derived from the volume and degree of metabolic abnormality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging risk score, MRI tumor/node (TN) stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA were used as predictors of pathologic stage in patients treated with RP (n=10) and PSA relapse in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage (P<0.01) and MRSI risk score (P<0.05) correlated with pathologic stage, but clinical stage did not (P=0.35). Magnetic resonance imaging TN stage was the only significant predictor of PSA relapse in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). Although the MRSI risk score did not reach significance (P=0.13), 6 patients with a score<0.9 were relapse-free, whereas 7 of 10 patients with a score>0.9 relapsed. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI risk assessments agreed in 15 of 16 patients. These preliminary results suggest that tumor metabolic assessment may indicate treatment outcome in high-risk patients with prostate cancer. Although MRSI did not provide added prognostic value to MRI in this small number of patients, MRSI might increase the confidence of the clinician in assessing risk on MRI by contributing supporting metabolic data

This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

Technical considerations and results	Aged, Ascites/et [Etiology], Ascites/pc [Prevention & Control], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/co [Complications], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Recurrence/pc [Prevention & Control], Research, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To present technical considerations and results of proton irradiation in a single fraction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with uncontrollable ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

[Japanese]	Aged, Blood Gas Analysis, Female, Fibrosis, Heavy Ions, Humans, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Radiation Injuries/pp [Physiopathology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Universities	Seventeen patients with clinical stage I lung cancer were given irradiation therapy with heavy ion radioactive rays at 73.1 +/- 11.2 GyE. Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications

The patients had stage T1 N0 M0 to T4 N3 M0 disease. Patients with T1 N0 M0 disease (273) had an excellent long-term survival (90%) as did those with T2 N0 M0 disease (142), whose 5-year survival was 70%. Patients with more advanced disease but no nodal spread did not respond as readily to radiotherapy; the 5-year survival was 40%. All patients were treated using a parallel pair set-up 6 X 6 cm lateral neck fields. A more aggressive radiotherapy regime to a larger tissue volume to include microscopic spread to lymph nodes may improve survival of locally advanced disease

Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordoma is a challenge. The authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordoma and 10 patients with chondrosarcoma. METHODS: Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%, respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordoma) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with worst RFS rates as compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy, followed by CSF leakages were the most frequent postoperative complication. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and the patient's age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy provided better prognosis for these patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a series of patients treated with proton beam irradiation between 1991 and December 1998. The data were analyzed to evaluate the local tumor control as well as the general progression and metastatic rate of the patients. Statistical analysis served to isolate risk factors for relapse or metastasis. RESULTS: We treated 1062 patients during the study period, with a median follow-up of 38 months. Local control was obtained for 97.1% of the patients. Tumors anterior to the equator were at risk for relapse. The survival rate was 92% at 2 years and 78% at 5 years. 73.1% of the 1062 patients died from metastasis, 6.1% of living patients presented with metastatic disease. The risk factors for death were the initial diameter, the age of the patient, and large tumor volume at diagnosis. Metastasis were essentially hepatic (94.6%). Risk factors for metastasis were: a large tumor volume, a lesion anterior or straddling the equator and the age of the patient. Ocular complications may induce a visual loss of 0.1 and less in 47% of the patients, due to optic nerve head and macular ischemia. 6% of the patients required secondary enucleation due to local complications (neovascular glaucoma). CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal melanoma allows good tumor control and eye retention. The survival prognosis is associated with the initial volume of the tumor. The functional results may be improved and new therapeutics are needed to treat metastatic disease

DESIGN: The study design was a nonrandomized, retrospective clinical study. Semiparametric and nonparametric statistical techniques were used. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred sixty-six posterior uveal melanoma patients were studied. INTERVENTION: Either iodine-125 plaque or helium ion radiation therapy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local tumor recurrence and systemic metastasis were measured. RESULTS: Local tumor recurrence was detected in 66 (8.6%) of 766 irradiated tumors. The 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 10%. The recurrence pattem was horizontal/marginal in 27 patients (41%) and vertical/diffuse in 39 patients (59%). Systemic metastasis was detected in 5 patients (19%) with horizontal/marginal recurrence and in 19 patients (49%) with vertical/diffuse recurrence. After known metastatic risk factors were controlled, the relative risk for metastasis was 2.2 for horizontal/marginal recurrence and 5.1 for vertical/diffuse recurrence (P = 0.05). The actuarial rate of systemic metastasis was 2.9% per year for all patients, 6.3% per year for patients with horizontal/marginal recurrence, and 15.5% per year for patients with vertical/diffuse recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Postirradiation local recurrence of posterior uveal melanoma is a risk factor for systemic metastasis. Vertical/diffuse recurrences may be associated more strongly with metastatic disease than horizontal/marginal recurrences

A patient with Hodgkin's disease has been chosen as an example and has been planned with different radiation treatment modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate mortality from dose distributions. To this purpose target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. From the mean doses of each organ the mortality has been derived. Our work suggests that calculations of mortality can be useful in comparative treatment planning. Such mortality calculations can be helpful to find decisions between radiotherapy treatment techniques (intensity modulated or conventional treatment) or between different types of radiation (photons, electrons, protons, neutrons)

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 55 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated between 2001 and 2005 with C-ion RT based on computed tomography treatment planning. All patients had a tumor of large size or one located close to the optic disk. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of NVG for the following parameters; gender, age, dose-volumes of the iris-ciliary body and the wall of eyeball, and irradiation of the optic disk (ODI). RESULTS: Neovascular glaucoma occurred in 23 patients and the 3-year cumulative NVG rate was 42.6 +/- 6.8% (standard error), but enucleation from NVG was performed in only three eyes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant risk factors for NVG were V50IC (volume irradiated > or =50 GyE to iris-ciliary body) (p = 0.002) and ODI (p = 0.036). The 3-year NVG rate for patients with V50IC > or =0.127 mL and those with V50IC <0.127 mL were 71.4 +/- 8.5% and 11.5 +/- 6.3%, respectively. The corresponding rate for the patients with and without ODI were 62.9 +/- 10.4% and 28.4 +/- 8.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dose-volume histogram analysis with computed tomography indicated that V50IC and ODI were independent risk factors for NVG. An irradiation system that can reduce the dose to both the anterior segment and the optic disk might be worth adopting to investigate whether or not incidence of NVG can be decreased with it

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-five patients with cervical cancer (Stage I-IV) treated by irradiation were included in the study. Among the 65 cases, 2 were in Stage I, 13 in Stage II, 40 in Stage III, and 10 in Stage IV. Patients who received surgical resection were excluded. Thirty-nine patients received BOAI and 44 received brachytherapy. Twenty-six patients were not indicated for BOAI because of insufficient renal function, hepatic complications, hematological complications, and refusal from the patients. Cisplatin (0.9-1.7 mg/kg), Adriamycin (0.7-0.9 mg/kg), and Pepleomycin (0.4-0.6 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously into the bilateral internal iliac arteries by BOAI. External irradiation was given by 10 MV x-ray. Total dose administered to the regional lymph nodes by the external irradiation was 48.3 +/- 8.7 Gy. Radium was used at brachytherapy. The dose delivered by the brachytherapy at point A was 45.3 +/- 14.9 Gy. Patients without brachytherapy received 26.1 +/- 19.1 Gy of boost irradiation by the external photon beam. The survival probabilities of the patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates of the Stage III patients with and without BOAI were 53 +/- 13% and 24 +/- 18%, respectively (p = 0.036). By multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model, stage and BOAI were selected as significant predictors of the prognosis. Transient bone marrow suppression was observed in about half of the patients with BOAI. No significant increase of the incidence of the late radiation damage by BOAI in rectum or in urinary bladder was observed. CONCLUSION: Balloon occluded arterial infusion of anticancer drugs may improve the prognosis of the patients with cervical cancer without increasing the incidence of the late radiation damage. A larger scale prospective randomized study is desired

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

After a 2 to 4 year follow-up, primary cancer was found to be controlled in 59 patients, a recurrence was noted in 16 patients but 12 patients had died without precise information concerning recurrence. We examined the correlation between recurrence and seven prognostic factors. Among these factors, the tumor volume, age, and the red blood corpuscle sedimentation rate showed a relatively strong correlation. A multivariable analysis (quantification methods II) was undertaken in order to integrate these prognostic factors and the score that was calculated from this analysis showed a strong correlation to local control. We believe that this score can be used for predicting recurrences and can be applied to the selection of patients for new treatments like hyperthermia or high LET irradiation

Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients (48 lesions) and nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were applied in the carbon dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 gray equivalents (GyE) by a 10% increment and from 68.4 to 79.2GyE by a 5% increment, respectively. The radiation target consisted of primary tumor. Image analysis of the patients with local recurrence was systematically performed after the treatment by focusing attention on the enhanced thin slice CT images of the primary lesion. By superimposing the dose distribution on the planning CT image and marking the anatomically identified loci of recurrence, it was possible to establish the relationship between the dose distribution and the incipient loci of recurrence and to classify the recurrence patterns from the differences in the recurrence loci. RESULTS: Local recurrence was found in 19 (23.2%) out of a total of 82 lesions. It is possible to distinguish between three recurrence patterns: Pattern 1 representing marginal recurrence and patterns 2a and 2b, which are both instances of in-field recurrence. In pattern 1, four recurrences take place from a region on the upper tumor margin. In pattern 2a, 13 recurrences take place from the center of the tumor. In pattern 2b, two recurrences take place from the near-center of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: For the 15 in-field recurrence lesions (patterns 2a and 2b) after excluding the four marginal recurrence lesions (patterns 1), we have established that the local control shows dose-dependence. Based on this, we have determined the optimal therapeutic dose

RT was given to a total dose of 60 Gy in six weeks, for CRT additional simultaneous 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12) and mitomycin C (5 mg/m2 days 5 and 12) was administered. 67% respectively 82% of the patients had UICC stage II to IIIB disease predominantly with G2 and G3 squamous cell carcinomas. Local control after three years was 79% for the RT group vs. 82% for the CRT group. Three-year survival rate was 68% and 71%, respectively. These differences were not significant. Only for G1- compared to G3-tumors there is a significantly higher survival rate. Acute and late damage was slightly lower for the RT treatment group (77% and 25%) compared to the CRT group (79% and 30%). In both treatment groups there was one patient needing a permanent colostomy due to radiation induced proctitis. In conclusion, RT or CRT should be the primary form of treatment in patients with and canal carcinoma and abdominoperineal resection should only be performed in case of local recurrence or tumor persistence. The final decision about the indications for RT or CRT can only be made with the results of a prospective randomized trial

In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

The local disease was controlled in 111 of these patients. This study reviews the 26 patients who have had their disease recur, and who have evaluable diagnostic studies to examine for probable causes of recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The histologies of the recurrent tumors were 21 non-chondroid chordomas, two chondroid chordomas, and three chondrosarcomas. The prescribed doses ranged from 67 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 72 CGE (average of 69 CGE). Doses to small regions of the tumor were deliberately reduced where they abutted certain normal tissues (brain stem, spinal cord, optic chiasm, and optic nerves) in order to keep these structures at acceptance dose levels. The first study, CT or MR scan, on which there was evidence of increase in tumor was carefully evaluated and that volume transferred to the CT scan on which the treatment plan had been developed. The 3D dose distribution in the region of recurrence was carefully analyzed and a judgement made as to the most probable cause of recurrence. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter (6 of 26) of the cases failed in the prescribed dose region. More than half (15 of 26) failed in regions where tumor dose was limited by normal tissue constraints. Approximately 10% of the patients recurred in the surgical pathway and 10% were judged to be marginal misses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 75% of the patients failed in regions receiving less than the prescribed dose. All tumors which failed in the high dose region had volume greater than 75 cc. Patients with cervical spine disease had a higher rate of recurrence (10 or 26) and larger tumors (average volume of 102 cc) than those with base of skull disease (16 of 115) with an average volume of 63 cc

The absorbed dose standard for ocular proton therapy beams at HCL was based on a fluence measurement with a Faraday cup (FC). A majority of proton therapy centers worldwide, however, use an absorbed dose standard that is based on an ionization chamber (IC) technique. The ion chamber calibration is deduced from a measurement in a reference 60Co photon field together with a calculated correction factor that takes into account differences in a chamber's response in 60Co and proton fields. In this work, we implemented an ionization chamber-based absolute dosimetry system for the HCL ocular beamline based on the recommendations given in Report 59 by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements. Comparative measurements revealed that the FC system yields an absorbed dose to water value that is 1.1% higher than was obtained with the IC system. That difference is small compared with the experimental uncertainties and is clinically insignificant. In June of 1998, we adopted the IC-based method as our standard practice for the ocular beam

In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

In view of this, pilot studies were instituted at Massachusetts General Hospital in which 32 patients received the standard previous treatment of external beam irradiation and surgery but in addition had an intraoperative electron beam boost of 1000-1500 rad to the remaining tumor or tumor bed. For the 16 patients who presented with unresectable primary lesions, the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy has resulted in a total absence of local recurrence with a minimum 20 month follow-up, and survival rates are statistically better than for the previous group treated with only external beam irradiation and surgical resection. In the group with residual disease, again there have not been any local recurrences in the 7 patients who received all treatment modalities versus 54% and 26% for the group with gross and microscopic residual treated with only external beam techniques. The remaining 9 patients presented with recurrent unresectable lesions--3 are alive (2 NED) at greater than or equal to 3 years

Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

Individual proton spectra from the 3-D array of spectra encompassing the lesion showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation necrosis, recurrent or residual tumor, or normal brain. The 1H-MRS imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or recurrent tumor and contrast-enhancing radiation-induced necrosis. Regions of abnormally high choline (Cho) levels, consistent with viable tumor, were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 gliomas. Changes in the serial 1H-MRS imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following treatment. These changes included the significant reduction in Cho levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to necrotic tissue. For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical progression, an increase in Cho levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or necrotic. Several patients showed regional variations in response to brachytherapy as evaluated by 1H-MRS imaging. This study demonstrates the potential of noninvasive 3-D 1H-MRS imaging to discriminate between the formation of contrast-enhancing radiation necrosis and residual or recurrent tumor following brachytherapy. This modality may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to brachytherapy by detecting the presence of abnormnal metabolite levels in nonenhancing regions of solid tumor	
1	826	Radiotherapy for local control of osteosarcoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Bone Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Bone Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Child, Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Osteosarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy], Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Osteosarcoma/su [Surgery], Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Local control of osteosarcoma in patients for whom a resection with satisfactory margins is not achieved can be difficult. This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05). No definitive dose-response relationship for local control of tumor was seen, although the local control rate was 71% +/- 9% for 32 patients receiving doses > or =55 Gy vs. 53.6% +/- 20.1% for 9 patients receiving <55 Gy (p = 0.11). Of 15 patients with tumors >5.3 cm, 9 received doses > or =55 Gy and the local control rate was 80% +/- 17.9%, and 6 received doses <55 Gy with a local control rate of only 50% +/- 25% at 5 years (p = 0.16). Among patients who underwent gross total resection, the local control rate was 77.5% +/- 9.95% in 22 patients with negative margins vs 66.7% +/- 27.2% in 3 patients with positive margins (p = 0.54). Two patients had unknown margin status. CONCLUSION: RT can help provide local control of osteosarcoma for patients in whom surgical resection with widely, negative margins is not possible. It appears to be more effective in situations in which microscopic or minimal residual disease is being treated

Clinical presentation is related to local invasion. Lesion of the body of the clivus can extend ventrally or dorsally and cause cranial nerve palsies, brain stem compression or hydrocephalus. Pathologically, they form soft, grey masses that are histologically benign but locally invasive and destructive. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging clearly depict the lesion. CT better demonstrates bone destruction and intralesional calcifications. In our case, MR was performed first and showed all the classical signs of skull base chordoma. CT provided complementary information about bone destruction which are also usual in this type of lesion. Major differential diagnoses of the chordoma in the clivus are the other central skull base masses. Biopsy and histology make the diagnosis. Usually treatment consists in surgery and radiotherapy but more recently proton beam therapy is used and seems to yield better results

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy

Angiography showed a small left pontine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with a small aneurysm on the pedicle feeding the AVM. The pedicle aneurysm was occluded by microcoils. The AVM was then treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up angiography 2 years later revealed that the AVM had disappeared completely without neurological deficit. The combination of embolization and proton-beam radiosurgery was curative in this patient with a pontine AVM associated with an aneurysm on the feeding artery, showing that these techniques can be used to treat inoperable vascular lesions safely

We present a case report that appears to contradict this doctrine. The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and was treated with surgical resection and postoperative proton-beam radiation therapy. Approximately 16 mo after completion of therapy, MRI demonstrated two new regions of enhancement, and an FDG-PET study was performed to further characterize these lesions. FDG-PET demonstrated an area of intense hypermetabolism, and wide surgical resection was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed reactive changes and areas of necrosis. There was no evidence of either recurrent or radiation-induced tumor

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) plans were designed for nine patients using the CORVUS treatment planning system (NOMOS Corp.). These plans were delivered using a tertiary collimator dedicated for serial tomotherapy attached to a 10-MV linear accelerator. For each patient, one optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) was placed on the sternum and one on the lower abdomen. The OSLDs were then processed, thereby estimating the in vivo absorbed doses to the sternum and gonads as a function of distance from the treatment site. RESULTS: The OSLDs were shown to measure known doses to within 5%, thereby validating their accuracy for this dose and energy range. In the patient studies, the dose received by the OSLDs varied in direct proportion to the number of monitor units delivered and inversely with the distance from the target volume; the patient dose at a distance of 15 cm from the target is approximately 0.4% of the total monitor units delivered, and drops to below 0.1% of the total MUs at approximately 40 cm from the center of the target. The average sternal dose was 1353 mSv and the average abdominal dose was 327 mSv for an average prescribed dose of 60.1 Gy. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the inefficient treatment delivery that on average required 9.9 MU/0.01 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: While IMRT reduces the normal tissue volume in the high-dose region, it also increases the overall monitor units delivered, and hence the whole-body dose, when compared with conventional treatment delivery. As has been noted in existing literature, these increases in whole-body dose from radiotherapy delivery may increase the likelihood of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of secondary malignancies from IMRT delivery, and compare this relative risk against the potential benefits of decreased normal tissue complication probabilities

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

After therapy they increased slowly. 3 months after irradiation the average immunoglobulin levels showed a reduction of 16%. After substitution of immunoglobulins no decrease of the levels was seen. After substitution of immunoglobulins the Karnofsky index was significantly higher. Substituted patients showed a lower rate of radiation pneumonitis

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome	
0	1042	Spot-scanning proton radiation therapy for recurrent, residual or untreated intracranial meningiomas.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Child, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm,Residual, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Recurrence, Safety, Survival, Survival Analysis, Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PRT) in the treatment of intracranial meningiomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

1	3899	The influence of computer tomography on treatment strategies and follow-up in tumors of the nasopharynx and the paranasal sinuses. A retrospective study on 104 patients	Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Methods, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ra [Radiography], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Retreatment, Retrospective Studies, Skull, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed/mt [Methods]	BACKGROUND: The high value of computer tomography (CT) for detailed imaging of nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinus tumors is known. Less known is the influence of such diagnostic findings on decisions of the therapist. An analysis of this influence might help to compare the value of CT and MRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 104 treated patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx (n = 54) and the paranasal sinuses (n = 50). The study analyzed the influence of CT on primary tumor diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment decision, therapy planning, detection and time of recurrences and retreatment of relapses. RESULTS: Tumors of the nasopharynx: The value of CT for tumor staging was 76% but there was no influence on treatment decision. Radiotherapy planning was influenced in 37% of cases. CT for follow-up was done in 22% of cases. Most relapses occurred within the first 2 years. Paranasal sinus tumors: There was no influence of CT on primary diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor staging was influenced by CT in 94%, treatment decision in 44% and radiotherapy planning in 60%. CT control immediately after therapy was of value in 40%. Most relapses were found within 3 years but some in the 4th and 5th year. Some patients survived 3 to 9 years after retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In tumors of the nasopharynx there is less influence of CT on therapy strategies than diagnostic radiologists might think. No CT is needed for treatment decision since radiotherapy is the only choice of treatment. CT influenced radiotherapy planning however, in about 1/3 of our cases answering sufficiently the 2 main questions: tumor spread into the anterior half of the facial skull or involvement of the base of skull. The retreatment of recurrences detected by CT showed poor results. Late recurrences seem to have better prognosis. We recommend therefore routinely 1 basic CT 6 months after primary treatment followed by 1 CT yearly from the 3rd to 5th year. MRT might offer more diagnostic details than CT. However, at present therapy is not influenced much by this. Since CT is cheaper and faster, MRT could be discussed as additional procedure when CT presents equivocal findings and this fact could be decisive for therapy planning. Paranasal sinus tumors: The influence of CT on tumor-staging and treatment decision is high and convincing. CT helps also at radiotherapy planning and control of tumor response after therapy. CT has high value in detecting recurrences. Retreatment could control disease in some of our patients for 3 to 9 years. Better results could be achieved possibly with earlier diagnosis of recurrence. We propose therefore a basic-CT 6 months after first treatment and 1 CT routinely from the 2nd to 5th year. From the therapist's point of view we recommend CT as first imaging procedure in sinonasal tumors. MRT, more time- and cost consuming, should be applied when CT is equivocal and treatment decision could be influenced

METHODS: Two patients initially diagnosed and treated for unilateral scleritis were referred for management of persistent inflammation. Additional evaluation uncovered underlying malignant processes. RESULTS: The first patient presented with scleritis initially responsive to systemic corticosteroids, with relapse one month later. Upon referral, peripheral fundus examination revealed elevated lesions. Additional studies confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The patient was treated with proton-beam irradiation. The second patient developed necrotizing scleritis unresponsive to systemic steroids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. A scleral biopsy disclosed an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma, likely metastatic. Exenteration was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis can present a diagnostic challenge. It is often the sole initial manifestation of an occult systemic problem. Treatment-resistant scleritis should raise the suspicion of an infectious or malignant masquerade

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing	
0	1140	Treatment planning comparison of conventional, 3D conformal, and intensity-modulated photon (IMRT) and proton therapy for paranasal sinus carcinoma	Austria, Humans, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinuses/ra [Radiography], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Planning Techniques, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	PURPOSE: To determine the potential improvements in patients with paranasal sinus carcinoma by comparing proton and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with conventional and conformal photon treatment planning techniques. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis	
1	3728	Radiation therapy for arteriovenous malformations: a review.[see comment]. [Review] [65 refs]	Boston, Brain, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Humans, Incidence, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/co [Complications], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Massachusetts, Mortality, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Recurrence, Research	There have been numerous case reports and series of patients treated with partial brain irradiation, linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and Bragg peak therapy for inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These cases are summarized and compared. There is convincing evidence that radiation therapy does have a role in obliterating carefully chosen inoperable lesions. The changes that occur in vessel walls after radiation are reviewed. Data about x-ray and gamma radiation are mostly historical and difficult to evaluate because of the techniques of partial brain irradiation. There is a lack of data about the volume of AVM treated and the minimum dose delivered to the AVM nidus. For gamma knife, heavy particle, and linear accelerator therapy, more complete data are available. The incidence of hemorrhage during the first 2 years after treatment, when radiation-induced vascular changes are proposed to occur, is approximately 2.6% per year for gamma knife therapy, 2% per year for proton beam therapy, 2.3% per year for helium beam therapy, and 2.3% per year for linear accelerator therapy. These rates are similar to the recurrence rate for hemorrhage of 2.2 to 3% per year expected based on the natural history of untreated AVMs. If AVM obliteration after therapy is not achieved, the incidence of recurrent hemorrhage remains between 2% per year after treatment with gamma knife therapy. The incidence of hemorrhage for all patients treated was reported as 0.15% per year in one study and 20% over 8 years in a follow-up study using proton beam therapy. Mortality from hemorrhage after treatment was 0.6% after gamma knife therapy, 2.3% after helium beam therapy, and 2 to 5% after proton beam therapy. These figures for mortality are all lower than the 11% observed for the natural history of untreated AVMs. Permanent neurological deficits experienced as a complication of radiation occurred in 2 to 3% of patients treated with gamma knife therapy, 4% of patients treated with helium beam therapy, 1.7% of patients treated with proton beam therapy, and 3% of patients treated with stereotactic linear accelerator therapy. Proton beam therapy has been used for both small and large lesions. The majority of lesions in patients treated with gamma knife, helium beam, and linear accelerator therapy have been small (usually less than 3.0 cm average diameter) lesions. In these patients with small inoperable lesions treated with accurately directed fields of isocentric radiation, the greatest incidence of AVM obliteration has been observed on follow-up angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 65]

We have made it a rule to do field localization by X-ray pictures before each treatment. For this purpose we have developed a localize-verify system consisting of a fluoroscopic unit and a real time digital image processing device. By using this system as well as X-ray films, field placement errors or corrected distance at field localization were measured in 11 patients with esophageal cancers. Measurements of corrected distances on a total of 177 localization attempts disclosed that correction by > 5 mm was necessary in 30.6% and by > 10 mm in 10.2% of all localization attempts. Corrected distances appeared to increase with age, possibly because the skin becomes looser and ambulatory status tends to be more limited in older patients. Field placement corrections of more than 5 mm were required in 66.7% of 60 localizations in patients > 80 years old. Two patients in whom the anatomical positions of the esophagus were easily movable are presented. The following common characteristics of these patients were considered high risk factors: they were more than 80 years old; lesions were located in the lower esophagus; and they had T1 tumors. These findings suggested that frequent positioning and verification of treatment fields are necessary in the accurate treatment of esophageal cancers, especially those in high-risk patients

METHODS: Modern skull base surgical techniques were used in all patients who were treated between August 1991 and July 2000. The degree of tumor resection was gauged according to intraoperative inspection and postoperative high-resolution imaging findings. There were 21 patients with primary disease and eight with recurrent disease. Total resection was accomplished in 18 patients. Five patients had undergone radiotherapy prior to the present surgery, and an additional eight patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. There were no surgery-related deaths. In five patients who died of the disease, surgery and radiotherapy had failed to effect a cure. Two of the remaining patients are alive with recurrent disease, and there is questionable evidence of recurrence in another patient. All 24 patients are functioning independently. Cranial nerve impairment was the most common postoperative deficit, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull base techniques in radical surgery provides an opportunity to excise the tumor and the involved bone. In most cases the procedure-related cranial nerve deficits improve over time. The complications of CSF leakage and infection can be minimized and are preventable. Proton beam irradiation is an excellent adjuvant treatment but is reserved for patients with definite tumor recurrence or residual tumor that can be identified on the imaging studies

Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis. Charged particle radiotherapy can safely deliver high tumor doses to paraspinal tumors with good local control

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four patients with fully excised, Stage I breast cancer treated with adjuvant proton 3D-CPBI had treatment plans generated using the mixed-modality, photon-electron 3D-CPBI technique. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, planning target volumes (PTVs; lumpectomy site plus 1.5-2.0 cm margin) and prescribed dose (32 Gy) were held constant. Plans were optimized for PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Proton and mixed-modality plans both provided acceptable PTV coverage with 95% of the PTV receiving 90% of the prescribed dose in all cases. Both techniques also provided excellent dose homogeneity with a dose maximum exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose in only one case. Proton 3D-CPBI reduced the volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose by an average of 36%. Statistically significant reductions in the volume of total ipsilateral breast receiving 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the prescribed dose were also observed. The use of protons resulted in small, but statistically significant, reductions in the radiation dose delivered to 5%, 10%, and 20% of ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart. The nontarget breast tissue dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI were not dependent on tumor location, breast size, PTV size, or the ratio of PTV to breast volume. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to photon-electron 3D-CPBI, proton 3D-CPBI significantly reduces the volume of irradiated nontarget breast tissue. Both approaches to accelerated partial breast irradiation offer exceptional lung and heart sparing

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large clinical series of patients with intraocular melanoma to determine if light irises are associated with increased risk of death from these tumors. METHODS: A total of 1162 patients treated with proton irradiation between 1984 and 1996 were observed through 1997. RESULTS: Iris color in the patients was blue or gray in 48%, green or hazel in 30%, and brown in 23%. Tumors in patients with blue or gray irises were less heavily pigmented (P<.001) and closer to the optic disc and macula (P<.001). Five- and 10-year metastasis-related death rates were 0.14 and 0.21, respectively, for those with blue or gray irises and 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, for those with darker irises (P = .02). In a Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for tumor characteristics, patients with blue or gray irises died of metastatic disease at a rate 1.90 times (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.85) that of patients with brown irises. The rate of metastatic death was not significantly elevated for those with green or hazel irises (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.23). CONCLUSION: Patients with blue or gray irises appear to be at increased risk of metastatic death from choroidal melanoma, independent of other risk factors	
0	4083	Proton radiation as boost therapy for localized prostatic carcinoma	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Methods, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectum, Research, X-Rays	A 160-MeV proton beam has been modified to irradiate patients with localized tumors by using convention treatment schedules. This proton beam has the physical advantage of megavoltage x-rays of reducing the radiation dose to normal tissues adjacent to the tumor volume. A perineal proton technique used as boost therapy (2,000 to 2,500 rads) was evaluated in the definitive irradiation of 17 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma. This technique allows repeated daily treatment of the carefully defined target volume with a precision of +/- 2 mm. Total dose to the prostatic tumor, but not to the posterior rectum, has been increased by 500 to 700 rads. After 12 to 27 months of observation, no noteworthy rectal reaction has developed in a patient, easily managed urethral strictures have developed in two patients, and all but one are locally controlled

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization	
0	579	Outcomes of surgery for resection of regions of symptomatic radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations	Adult, California, Female, Helium, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/su [Surgery], Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Injuries/ra [Radiography], Radiation Injuries/su [Surgery], Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Research, Retrospective Studies, Time, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVE: Although radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), including radiation necrosis (RN), is often treated with surgical resection, detailed outcome data are lacking after resection of symptomatic radiation-injured regions with imaging characteristics suspicious for RN after SRS for arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 426 ciliochoroidal melanomas that met COMS inclusion criteria for randomisation to enucleation versus radioactive plaque but were treated with either helium ions or 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: At 3 years 36.0% of eyes had 6/12 or better visual acuity. The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision

In this paper, the present status of BNCT for malignant melanoma was introduced. As a melanoma-targetting 10B-compound, 10B-paraboronophylalanine (BPA) was used. It was administered by multiple subcutaneous injection or intravenous drip infusion. We adopted the maximum tolerance dose to the skin as a therapeutic dose regardless of the tumor 10B concentration, because we cannot directly measure it. For this purpose, an approximation of skin concentration was made using blood data just after the administration. We treated 14 melanoma patients in this way and obtained good local control of the tumor with tolerable skin reaction. More experience with logical analysis and basic research is necessary for further development of this therapy

Prolactin concentrations reduced both in macro- and microprolactinomas patients. The response was achieved in 96% of the cases in adenoma stages I-IIIa. Such results are superior to those reached with other treatment modalities. The efficacy of the above proton treatment can be raised by adjuvant use of chemotherapy

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the frequency of HP dysfunction in adults after RT for nonpituitary brain tumors. METHOD: We studied 56 adult patients who received external beam RT for primary nonpituitary brain tumors at time intervals of 12-150 months after RT. The control group consisted of 20 RT-naive patients with primary brain tumors. GH and adrenal axes were assessed using the insulin tolerance test or the glucagon stimulation test. Gonadotroph, thyrotroph, and lactotroph function were assessed using baseline blood measurements. The biological effective dose (BED) to the HP axis was calculated in the RT patients. RESULTS: Hypopituitarism was present in 41% of patients. The frequency of GH, ACTH, gonadotropin, and TSH deficiencies, and hyperprolactinemia was 32, 21, 27, 9, and 32%, respectively. Any degree of hypopituitarism and GH deficiency was significantly associated with longer time interval from RT and greater BED. However, gonadotropin deficiency and hyperprolactinemia were only related to BED, whereas ACTH deficiency was only significantly associated with the time interval from RT. One RT-naive patient was GH deficient. CONCLUSION: Adult patients treated with cranial irradiation for primary nonpituitary brain tumors are at high risk of hypopituitarism, which is time and dose dependent. Long-term surveillance and periodic evaluation are needed. We recommend that adult late effect clinics, similar to those for children, should be established

We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor; perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact. All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Another patient had progressive enhancement and low relative cerebral blood volume and flow; biopsy showed necrosis and inflammation. One patient had progressive enhancement and high choline levels (proved anaplastic astrocytoma). In another, T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis); enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up). CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor

Despite its increased use, follow-up periods for radiosurgery are short and the numbers of patients reported are small. To add to the available information, the authors report their experience with the application of linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife modalities in 13 patients with 16 tumors. METHODS: All patients were treated with frame-based LINAC or CyberKnife radiosurgery, with doses ranging from 1400 to 2700 cGy. Patients were retrospectively assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patients' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow-up duration was 41 months and the mean follow-up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or decreased in size on follow-up MR images. All patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, this individual had received previous external-beam radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings continue to support radiosurgery as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors that results in low rates of morbidity

Life expectancy following conservative treatment is equal to or better than that following enucleation. This is demonstrated by nonrandomized comparative studies, and by the authors' own long-term results following the conservative treatment of melanomas by 60Co applicators: mortality due to metastases of small melanomas was 3% (V = smaller than 10 x 10 x 3 mm), with medium-size melanomas it was 12% (V = 10 x 10 x 3-15 x 15 x 5 mm), and with large melanomas 21% (V = larger than 15 x 15 x 5 mm). Accelerated proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas is currently the method of choice for the conservative treatment of uveal melanomas. The sharp boundaries of the irradiated zone, the uniformly distributed irradiation dose, and beam-splitting are the main advantages of this technique. During the last three years, 310 cases of uveal melanoma have been treated in Switzerland with an accelerated proton beam. Of these, 214 were followed up for more than one year. Eight patients (3.9%) died of metastases. Visual acuity was identical or superior to initial visual acuity in 60.3% of the cases, while 39.6% exhibited a deterioration of vision or a functional loss. Favorable results achieved by conservative treatment of uveal melanomas considerably limited the indications for enucleation, which is now only performed in exceptional situations

Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1981 and 1988, 15 patients with craniopharyngioma were treated in part or entirely with fractionated 160 MeV proton beam therapy. The group consisted of 5 children (median age, 15.9 years) and 10 adults (median age, 36.2 years). Median dose prescribed to the tumor was 56.9 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; 1 proton Gray = 1.1 CGE). The median proton component was 26.9 CGE. Patients were treated after documented recurrence after initial surgery (n = 6) or after subtotal resection or biopsy (n = 9). None had had prior radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median observation period of surviving patients (n = 11) was 13.1 years from radiotherapy. One patient was lost to follow-up with tumor control after 5.2 years. Actuarial 10-year survival rate was 72%. Four patients have died 5-9.1 years after treatment, two from local failure. Actuarial 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. The functional status of the living adult patients is unaltered from their preradiotherapy status; all of them continued leading normal or near normal working lives. None of the patients treated as a child had experienced recurrence of tumor. One child shows learning difficulties and slight retardation, comparable to his preradiotherapy status. The others have professional achievements within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Results in terms of survival and local control are comparable with other contemporary series. Although no formal neuropsychological testing was performed, the surrogate measures of lifestyle and professional accomplishments appear to be satisfactory

Twenty tumors (1.9%) exhibited definitive growth between 4 months and 66 months after irradiation (median, 19 months): 10 were marginal recurrences, 5 were ring melanomas, 3 were uncontrolled tumors, and 2 were extrascleral extensions. Ten of these eyes were enucleated without further intervention, 2 patients died of metastases soon after the growth was detected, and 8 patients had further conservative therapy. In 5 other patients, tumor growth was suspected but unconfirmed and the eye was enucleated elsewhere; the 5-year probability of local tumor control based on 25 recurrences was 97% +/- 1%. There was a nonsignificant increase in the rate of metastases among patients with documented tumor recurrence (adjusted relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 3.4). Results suggest that recurrence of uveal melanomas treated by proton beam therapy is uncommon, but that treatment failure may increase risk of death from metastasis

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

The choice of therapy depends on many factors, and plaque radiotherapy is often used. OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcome of plaque radiotherapy in the management of ciliary body melanoma and to identify the risk factors associated with the development of radiation complications, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and melanoma-related death after plaque radiotherapy of ciliary body melanoma. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical records of 136 patients with ciliary body melanoma who were treated with plaque radiotherapy between July 1976 and June 1992. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the most frequent radiation complication at 5 years' follow-up was cataract, developing in 48% of the patients, followed by neovascular glaucoma (21%), retinopathy (20%), scleral necrosis (12%), and vitreous hemorrhage (11%). Visual acuity decrease (by > or =3 Snellen lines) was noted in 40% of the patients at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 8% of the patients developed recurrence, 28% had metastasis, and 22% died of melanoma-related causes by 5 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the factors predictive of radiation cataract were superonasal (P = .003) and inferior tumor meridian (P = .02) compared with inferonasal meridian and apex dose rate greater than 57 cGy/h (P = .05). The development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly related to iris involvement with the ciliary body tumor (P<.001). The factors predictive of development of radiation retinopathy were base dose rate greater than 230 cGy/h (P = .03) and the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = .05). The only predictor of metastasis was tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02). The risk factors for melanoma-related death were the presence of metastasis (P<.001), tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .02), and recurrence (P = .02). Multivariate analyses showed that the most significant variables predictive of the development of scleral necrosis were intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .007). The most significant predictive factors for vitreous hemorrhage were visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 (P = .02) and intraocular pressure greater than 15 mm Hg (P = .02). The best subset of independent predictors of vision decrease were mushroom tumor shape (P = .002), age older than 61 years (P = .006), and superonasal meridian (P = .04). The risks for melanoma-related death were presence of metastasis (P<.001) and tumor thickness greater than 7 mm (P = .01). There was no group of significant variables predictive for radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plaque radiotherapy offers 92% 5-year local control rate for ciliary body melanoma. Metastasis occurs in 28% of the patients treated with this method by 5 years. Patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in thickness are at greater risk than patients with thinner tumors for metastatic disease and melanoma-related death. Major radiation complications include radiation cataract, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy, and scleral necrosis

The prognosis of unresectable/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma remains very poor because the rarity of the tumor has made it difficult to establish treatment guidelines, and diagnosis and the resultant treatment can be greatly delayed. We treated a 24-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma of the right adrenal gland which extended to the inferior vena cava. Although she underwent surgical resection of the extensive tumor as the primary treatment, the disease recurred in the lung and liver as multiple metastases shortly after surgery. She received intensive multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP regimen), embolization of the feeding arteries, and proton irradiation for the liver mass. Finally, she underwent reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA 1-locus-mismatched sibling donor. A prolonged survival of 39 months after the onset of the disease was achieved. Although this experience is limited, we suggest that TIP chemotherapy was effective for adrenocortical carcinoma, and a graft-versus-tumor effect after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation may have contributed to the prolonged survival

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment

As of 9/92 a total of 28 patients suffering from peripheral (n = 20) or centrally (n = 8) located soft tissue sarcomas had been were treated. Thirteen patients revealed a primary and 15 patients a recurrent tumor. Tumor resection with negative margins was performed in 20 patients, positive margins remained in 5 patients, and gross macroscopic residual disease in 3 patients. Combined intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy was applied in 22 patients, using IORT doses of 10-20 Gy and an external beam dose of 26-50 Gy. Three patients were irradiated intraoperatively twice with a time interval of 24 h. After a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 20 patients are disease free. Two patients died 4 and 5 months after the end of therapy with rapidly progressive distant metastases. An infield failure within the external beam target volume was seen in 1 patient and local failure at the field margin of the external field in 3 patients. So far, there have been no IORT infield failures. Follow-up is performed with magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 patients a second operation was necessary because of a severe wound infection, including one patient suffering from osteomyelitis of a neighboring bone. Mild sensory neuropathy occurred in 1 patient 7 months after treatment. Overall only mild and reversible postoperative and posttherapeutic complications were seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)

An electron beam with the energy of 7 MeV was produced on the small-size betatron, irradiation fields were formed, and absorbed dose distribution was studied. The efficacy of the use of the beam in 110 patients with superficial malignant tumors was analyzed. The use of electron beam radiation was found promising for therapy of patients with locally spread types of skin and lower lip cancers and breast cancer local recurrences. Complete tumor regression was noted in 75-90% of the patients. Intraoral cone electron therapy combined with 60Co-therapy of surgery was employed for early cancer of the oral cavity

These patients refuse to go in to surgery or have indications for surgery (183 patients--T(1-4)N(0-3)M(0-1)). This method consists of the combination of the traditional method of the whole breast and/or nodal photon irradiation with local highly concentrated proton irradiation in the dosage iso-equivalent to tumor (proton with energy from 130 to 180 MeV, with stop in the target in notice depth). We used the irradiation of the adenohypophysis with narrow proton beams energy 200 MeV. The aim of the first combination of the components is the selectively influence on the target and the channeling to the tumor and its subclinical substances the dosages sufficient for the total irradiation of tumor with sparing surrounding tissues and parts of body. The goal of irradiation of adenohypophysis with protons is the normalization of its hormonal activity and elimination of factors stimulating growth of tumor cells in case of dishormonal cancer. The suggested method didu't only improve the results of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, but also contributed to the reducing of the emotional stress. We received high results of the patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer of criteria: local control rate (96%), long remission (more then 40%) and 5-year actuarial survival rate (83%). The patients examined during 5 and 18 years. It made a good cosmetic effect and high quality life of the patients with breast cancer	
0	1585	Pedicled rhinotomy for clival chordomas invaginating the brainstem	Adult, California, Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Cranial Fossa,Posterior, Dura Mater/pa [Pathology], Dura Mater/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasal Cavity/su [Surgery], Neoplasm Invasiveness, Nose, Radiotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Rotation, Skull Base Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Base Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Treatment Outcome	OBJECT: Clival chordomas are frequently midline lesions whose posterior growth may breach the dura and invaginate the brainstem. This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients. METHODS: Pedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation

BACKGROUND: Because of the surrounding vital structures and the difficulties in achieving wide surgical exposure, the treatment of clival lesions is challenging. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, many centers use facial incisions and osteotomies to approach clival lesions. Minimally invasive endoscopic techniques have the potential to minimize morbidity while yielding similar surgical results. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with tumors involving the clivus that underwent endoscopic resection between 2000 and 2004 were identified. Charts were reviewed for clinical characteristics, previous therapies, diagnosis, tumor extent, management modalities, length of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. There were four males and two females with a mean age of 50 years, ranging from 29 to 66 years. The most common presenting symptoms were visual disturbances. Three patients had prior craniotomy with subtotal tumor resection. The pathology included three clival chordomas, and one each of meningioma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. All patients were managed with computer-aided transnasal endoscopic tumor resection with neurosurgical standby or involvement. None of the patients required additional craniotomies. The mean follow-up was 13 (range, 8-24) months. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in three patients, and two patients are currently undergoing proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT). The average length of hospital stay was 2 (range, 2-3) days. There were no major postoperative complications. At the last follow-up, five patients were alive with two patients being free of disease. Two patients with residual disease are currently undergoing PBRT, and one patient developed distant metastasis. One patient died of unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report suggests that transnasal endoscopic management of clival lesions is a viable option to traditional open approaches with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The use of computer-aided surgery further minimizes surgical risks while maximizing tumor resection

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first 9 pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy (1.8 Gy x 28) at the Massachusetts General Hospital had treatment plans generated using a 5 CGE x 5 fraction proton regimen. To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant. Plans were optimized for target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Hypofractionated proton and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans both provided acceptable target volume coverage and dose homogeneity. Improved dose conformality provided by the hypofractionated proton regimen resulted in significant sparing of kidneys, liver, and small bowel, evidenced by significant reductions in the mean doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, to these structures. Kidney and liver sparing was most evident in low-dose regions (< or =20% prescribed dose for both kidneys and < or =60% prescribed dose for liver). Improvements in small-bowel dosimetry were observed in high- and low-dose regions. Mean stomach and duodenum doses, expressed as percentage prescribed dose, were similar for the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: A proton radiotherapy schedule consisting of 5 fractions of 5 CGE as part of neoadjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas seems dosimetrically feasible, providing excellent target volume coverage, dose homogeneity, and normal tissue sparing. Hypofractionated proton radiotherapy in this setting merits Phase I clinical trial investigation

We described in this study the first case of petrousal bone apex chondroblastoma. METHODS: The tumor occurred in a 12-year-old girl and was revealed by left hypoacusis, vertigo, and walking instability. Computerized tomography scan depicted well-demarcated and osteolytic lesion of the left petrousal bone just before the internal acoustic meatus. The tumor was operated on by a subtemporal approach with a subtotal resection. Lesion recurred and was operated a second time by a combined approach subtemporal and translabyrinthine. This treatment was completed by radiotherapy. We used a combination of photon therapy and proton therapy. Outcome was good and free of recurrence 36 months after the second operation. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy can be particularly useful for skull base tumors frequently radioresistant and near very important structures. This case is the first one of a successful treatment by proton therapy for chondroblastoma recurrence

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerns 538 patients referred by French institutions between June 1991 and December 1996. The eye and tumor parameters were measured using ultrasonography and angiography. Since 1994, CT scans were performed in most patients to help determine the axial length and the shape of the ocular globe. Tantalum clips were inserted around the tumor by the referring ophthalmologist. There were 349 posterior pole tumors (64.9%), 130 equatorial tumors (24.1%), and 59 ciliary body tumors (11%). Two hundred four patients (37.9%) had T1 or T2 tumors, and 334 patients (62.1%) had T3 or T4 tumors. The median tumor diameter was 14.6 mm, and the median tumor height was 5.1 mm. All patients received 52 Gy (57.20 Gy Co-equivalent dose) on 4 consecutive days. The data were analyzed by December 1997. RESULTS: The CSS was 77.4% at 78 months, the overall survival was 73.8% and the local control was 89.0%. The CSS was not influenced by the patient age or the site of the tumor. It was 81.5% for T1 and T2 tumors, versus 75% for T3 and T4 tumors (P = 0.035). It was found that the tumor diameter, rather than the height, was the most important parameter affecting outcome. The metastatic rate was 8%. It depended on the T stage, tumor diameter and thickness, but not the tumor site. Thirty-eight enucleations were performed, most of them due to tumor progression and/or glaucoma. One-third of the patients in whom visual acuity was adequately scored before and after treatment had a stable, if not improved vision, and half the patients retained useful vision after treatment. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients suffering from uveal melanoma and treated with high-energy protons compares favorably with other techniques of treatment. The tumor dimensions affected CSS and metastatic rate. Even though two-thirds of patients had posterior pole tumors, half of them retained useful vision

Preliminary results	Aged, Angiography, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Epithelium, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phosphorus, Prognosis, Radiation Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Television, Time, Ultrasonography	Choroidal malignant melanomas in nine patients were treated with proton beam irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Cambridge, Mass. Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

[Russian]	Adult, Eye, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	This paper presents the effects of proton beam therapy of 175 patients with tumors of the eye. Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation

A 74-year-old patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago and started on the endocrine therapy with LH-RH agonist. He had no apparent distant metastasis, and received radiation therapy 8 years ago. He has complained of low back pain since several months ago. A high uptake on bone scintigram and osteolytic and osteoblastic damages on CT were noted in pubic bone and sacrum. The PSA level was less than 0.2 ng/ml. Pathohistological diagnosis by biopsy of the pubic bone was chondroblastic type osteosarcoma, showing an atypical cell proliferation with osteoid. Immunostaining for nonepithelial marker vimentin was positive. He underwent heavy ion radiation therapy for osteosarcoma at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. Osteosarcoma is one of the rare delayed complications after radiation therapy and requires biopsy for correct diagnosis

We retrospectively analyzed our experience in 239 patients to assess treatment outcome with this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1990, 239 uveal melanoma patients were treated with 125I plaques at the University of California, San Francisco. High intensity 125I seeds in the range of 3-20 mCi were used to give a minimum tumor dose of 70 Gy in 4 days. Initial mean tumor size was 10.9 mm x 9.2 mm x 5.5 mm with a range in tumor diameter from 4 to 18 mm and tumor height from 1.9 to 11.1 mm. Best corrected pre-treatment visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 92% of patients. RESULTS: Local tumor control was maintained in 91.7% of patients with a mean follow-up of 35.9 months; 19 patients had local tumor progression; mean time to progression was 27.3 mo (1.8 to 60.1 mo). Actuarial local control is 82% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrates significant correlation of local failure with larger maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0008), closer proximity to the fovea (p = 0.0001), lower radiation dose (p = 0.0437), and smaller ultrasound height (p = 0.0034). The actuarial incidence of distant metastases is 12% at 5 years with multivariate analysis showing significant correlation only with maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.0064). Visual outcome is 20/200 or better in 58% of patients. CONCLUSION: While the tumor control rates appear favorable, ocular morbidity is significant. A current randomized trial comparing 125I plaque with Helium ion therapy is in progress with specific comparison of tumor control, survival, and visual outcome

METHODS: The authors prospectively studied helium-ion irradiation and iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy in a randomized, dynamically balanced trial. Of the 184 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 86 were treated with helium ions and 98 with 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: No patients with uveal melanoma had a history of systemic malignancy. Tumors were less than 15 mm in maximum diameter and less than 10 mm in thickness. A minimum tumor dose of 70 GyE was delivered to the tumor apex. There was a significantly higher local recurrence rate after 125I brachytherapy than after helium-ion irradiation. Enucleations occurred more frequently after brachytherapy (relative risk = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-5.78). More anterior segment complications occurred after helium-ion irradiation. To date, there has been no measurable impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: Most uveal melanomas can be managed with radiation with retention of the eye. There was better tumor control with helium-ion irradiation; however, there were more anterior segment complications	
0	410	The effect of beam energy on the quality of IMRT plans for prostate conformal radiotherapy.[see comment]	Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Neutrons, Photons, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Protons, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography Scanners,X-Ray Computed	Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) for prostate cancer is most commonly delivered with high-energy photons, typically in the range of 10-21 MV. With the advent of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), an increase in the number of monitor units (MU) relative to 3DCRT has lead to a concern about secondary malignancies. This risk becomes more relevant at higher photon energies where there is a greater neutron contribution. Subsequently, the majority of IMRT prostate treatments being delivered today are with 6-10 MV photons where neutron production is negligible. However, the absolute risk is small [Hall, E. J. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, Protons, and the Risk of Second Cancers. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 65, 1-7 (2006); Kry, F. S., Salehpour, M., Followill, D. S., Stovall, M., Kuban, D. A., White, R. A., and Rosen, I. I. The Calculated Risk of Fatal Secondary Malignancies From Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys 62, 1195-1203 (2005).] and therefore it has been suggested that the use of an 18MV IMRT may achieve better target coverage and normal tissue sparing such that this benefit outweighs the risks. This paper investigates whether 18MV IMRT offer better target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Computed Tomography (CT) image sets of ten prostate cancer patients were acquired and two separate IMRT plans were created for each patient. One plan used 6 MV beams, and the other used 18 MV, both in a coplanar, non-opposed beam geometry. Beam arrangements and optimization constraints were the same for all plans. This work includes a comparison and discussion of the total integral dose, neutron dose conformity index, and total number of MU for plans generated with both energies

A slight but significant difference was noted between the two T categories. Fifty-three patients who were tumour-free 3 to 4 months after irradiation had a 55 per cent survival. No other prognostic parameters were identified on the basis of histologic or radiologic findings. In 14 patients severe radiation complications were observed (bladder 9, small bowel 3, combined 2). In patients with radiation sensitive bladder carcinoma, radical radiation therapy seems to be a comparable alternative to total cystectomy

DESIGN: Eligible patients had clinical stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection for medical reasons or because of patient refusal. Patients with adequate cardiopulmonary function received 45 Gy to the mediastinum and gross tumor volume with photons with a concurrent proton boost to the gross tumor volume of an additional 28.8 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE). Total tumor dose was 73.8 CGE given over 5 weeks. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary function received proton-beam radiotherapy to the gross tumor volume only, with 51 CGE given in 10 fractions over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in the study from July 1994 to March 1998. Clinical staging of patients was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 2 patients; and stage IIIa, 8 patients. Eighteen patients received a combination of protons and x rays, while 19 patients received proton-beam radiation only. Follow-up of evaluable patients ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 14 months. Two patients in the proton and photon arm developed pneumonitis that resolved with oral steroids; otherwise, no significant toxicities were encountered. The actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years for the entire group was 63%; for stage I patients, disease-free survival at 2 years was 86%. Local disease control was 87%. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results from this study indicate that proton-beam radiotherapy can be used safely in this group of patients. Disease-free survival and local control appear to be good and compare favorably with published reports utilizing conventional photon irradiation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 24 children treated between 1986 and 1994, no head fixation was applied and boost irradiation was not based on individual radiation treatment planning. Since 1995, boost irradiation has been assisted by CT-based individual radiation treatment planning and ORFIT head fixation in 59 patients. The influence of various factors including age, sex, tumor location, extent, type of surgery, risk group, radiation dose to posterior fossa and spinal axis, and the effect of head fixation and CT-assisted radiation treatment planning on 5-year relapse-free and 5-year overall survival was investigated. RESULTS: Overall and relapse-free survival rates for all 83 patients were 73.5% and 60.7%. Univariate analysis identified metastatic disease (p = 0.034) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.013) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Relapse-free survival rates were influenced by metastatic disease (p = 0.028) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.009). On multivariate analysis, metastatic disease (p = 0.04) and the application of head fixation and individual radiation treatment planning (p = 0.045) were significant factors for overall and relapse-free survival (p = 0.036 and p = 0.041) as well. CONCLUSION: Metastatic disease appears to be correlated with a worse prognosis in this analysis. Individual radiation treatment planning and head fixation have a positive impact on survival. For postoperative radiotherapy of the posterior fossa, the application of head fixation and individual CT-based radiation treatment planning is considered indispensable in each case

One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now

[French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them	
0	1769	A comparison of dose distributions of proton and photon beams in stereotactic conformal radiotherapy of brain lesions	Brain Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Humans, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	PURPOSE: Micromultileaf collimators (mMLC) have recently been introduced to conform photon beams in stereotactic irradiation of brain lesions. Proton beams and stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) can be used to tailor the dose to nonspherical targets, as most tumors of the brain are irregularly shaped. Comparative planning of brain lesions using either proton or stereotactically guided photon beams was done to assess the institution's clinically available modality for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For the photon treatment, multiple stereotactically guided uniform intensity beams from a linear accelerator were used, each conformed to a projection of the planning target volume (PTV) by a mMLC. Proton beams were delivered from an isocentrically mounted gantry, using the spot-scanning technique and energy modulation. Seven patients were scanned in a stereotactic frame; target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) were delineated with the help of MR images. Four different lesions were selected: (1) concave, (2) ellipsoid isolated, (3) superficial and close to an organ at risk, and (4) irregular complex. Dose distributions in the PTV and critical structures were calculated using three-dimensional treatment-planning systems, followed by both a quantitative (by dose--volume histogram and conformity index) and qualitative (visual inspection) assessment of the plans. RESULTS: A high degree of conformation was achieved with a mMLC and stereotactic uniform intensity beams with comparable conformity indices to protons for 5 out of 7 plans, especially for superficial or spherical lesions. In the cases studied, the conformity index was better for protons than for photons for complex or concave lesions, or when the PTV was in the neighborhood of critical structures. CONCLUSION: The results for the cases studied, show that for simple geometries or for superficial lesions, there is no advantage in using protons. However, for complex PTV shapes, or when the PTV is in the vicinity of critical structures, protons seem to be potentially better than the fixed-field photon technique

Symptoms of nasolacrimal duct obstruction and epiphora were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. All patients had nasolacrimal duct irrigation. Patients intubated before irradiation maintained patency (11 of 12), whereas those in the control group did not (zero of 12) (P less than .0014); ten of 12 control patients had closure of both superior and inferior puncta. No significant difference in symptoms of epiphora was observed between the two groups

This conjunctival melanoma arose from primary acquired melanosis with atypia at the temporal corneoscleral limbus. The patient was treated using a combination of surgical excision with physical treatment by ocular proton therapy. Progression remained under control 11 months after treatment: no local tumour recurrence or metastasis was observed. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia must be regarded as a premalignant melanocytic lesion.

In most cases a single dose of stereotactic irradiation effects the reduction of the tumor volume in a few days. External whole brain and, in two cases, spinal irradiation completed the treatment to avoid seeding of tumor cells. The technique and the advantages of this original therapeutical approach to intracranial germinomas are described and discussed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose plans of 6 stereotactically treated patients were recalculated for IMSRT by use of the same field setup and an inverse planning algorithm. Proton and IMPT plans were calculated anew. Three different tumor shapes, multifocal, ovoid, and irregular, were analyzed, as well as dose to organs-at-risk (OAR) in the vicinity of the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distributions were calculated from beam-setup data for a manual mMLC for stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy (SCRT), a dynamic mMLC for IMSRT, the spot-scanning technique for protons, and a modified spot-scanning technique for IMPT. SCRT was included for a part of the comparison. Criteria for assessment were PTV coverage, dose-volume histograms (DVH), volumes of specific isodoses, and the dose to OAR. RESULTS: Dose conformation to the PTV is equally good for all three techniques and tumor shapes considered. The volumes of the 90% and 80% isodose were comparable for all techniques. For the 50% isodose volume, a divergence between the two modes was seen. In 3 cases, this volume is smaller for IMSRT, and in the 3 other cases, it is smaller for IMPT. This difference was even more pronounced for the volumes of the 30% isodose; IMPT shows further improvement over conventional protons. OAR in concavities (e.g., the brainstem) were similarly well spared by protons and IMSRT. IMPT spares critical organs best. Fewer proton beams are required to achieve similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of intensity modulation improves the conformality of mMLC-based SCRT. Conformation of dose to the PTV is comparable for IMSRT, protons, and IMPT. Concerning the sparing of OAR, IMSRT is equivalent to IMPT, and IMPT is superior to conventional protons. The advantage of protons lies in the lower integral dose

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

Diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases and review of the literature	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Chondrosarcoma/di [Diagnosis], Chondrosarcoma/pa [Pathology], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Bone, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects	
0	1105	A treatment planning comparison of intensity modulated photon and proton therapy for paraspinal sarcomas	Cobalt, Heart, Humans, Lead, Liver, Lung, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach, Switzerland	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between intensity modulated (IM) photon therapy and IM proton therapy (IMPT) in paraspinal sarcomas, so as to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. In the case of IM proton therapy, plans were compared also for two different sizes of the pencil beam. Finally, a 10% and 20% dose escalation with IM protons was planned, and the consequential organ at risk (OAR) irradiation was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 5 patients were computed for IM photons (7 coplanar fields) and protons (3 coplanar beams), using the KonRad inverse treatment planning system (developed at the German Cancer Research Center). IMPT planning was performed assuming 2 different sizes of the pencil beam: IMPT with a beam of full width at half-maximum of 20 mm, and IMPT with a "mini-beam" (IMPT(M), full width at half-maximum = 12 mm). Prescribed dose was 77.4 Gy or cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for protons to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Surface and center spinal cord dose constraint for all techniques was 64 and 53 Gy/CGE, respectively. Tumor and OAR dose-volume histograms were calculated. Results were analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient, and conformity index. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume coverage was optimal and equally homogeneous with both IM photon and IM proton plans. Compared to the IM photon plans, the use of IM proton beam therapy leads to a substantial reduction of the OAR total integral dose in the low-level to mid-dose level. Median heart, lung, kidney, stomach, and liver mean dose and dose at the 50% volume level were consistently reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 25. Tumor dose homogeneity in IMPT(M) plans was always better than with IMPT planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient, 0.19 vs. 0.25). IMPT dose escalation (to 92.9 CGE to the GTV) was possible in all patients without exceeding the normal-tissue dose limits. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of IM photon therapy, when compared to IM protons, can result in similar levels of tumor conformation. IM proton therapy, however, reduces the OAR integral dose substantially, compared to IM photon radiation therapy. As a result, tumor dose escalation was always possible with IM proton planning, within the maximal OAR dose constraints. In IM proton planning, reducing the size of the proton pencil beam (using the "mini-beam") improved the dose homogeneity, but it did not have a significant effect on the dose conformity

The proposed fractionation strategy consisted of a SIB treatment following a first phase of conventional fractionation to the elective volume (named SEQ/SIB). The novel method was compared to a conventional sequential fractionation and to a full SIB approach. Treatment plans were designed for five patients on the proton planning system developed for spot scanning at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Villigen (CH). Three to five beams were applied for all plans and fractionations. All effective dose distributions were corrected using biological models to take into account repopulation and time at repopulation onset. Corrected and uncorrected plans were compared on the basis of dosimetry criteria and dose-volume histograms. The results showed a dosimetric advantage for the SEQ/SIB approach in terms of target coverage, without significant disadvantages for risk structures and healthy tissue. Considering the high logistic impact and the limited availability of radiation facilities, the clinical exploitation of accelerated SIB treatment with protons appears promising

Results of 5 1/2-year study	Adult, Aged, Computers, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Neoplasm Metastasis, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	Proton beam irradiation was used in the treatment of 76 uveal melanomas from July 1975 to December 1980. Five (7%) were small, 32 (42%) were medium, and 39 (51%) were large melanomas. The follow-up period ranged from two months to 5 1/2 years; 19 patients were followed up for more than two years and 39 were observed for more than a year. Tumor regression has been achieved in all eyes with more than 12 months of follow-up except one, which was enucleated because of secondary complications. Three patients in whom metastatic disease developed died. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used for the treatment of relatively large lesions that previously were considered untreatable and reduces the high ocular morbidity experienced with other methods in the treatment of medium and small melanomas

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing

Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

1	2622	A performance study of the Loma Linda proton medical accelerator	Biophysics, California, Californium, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radio Waves, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Synchrotrons/is [Instrumentation], Time, Universities	More than three years have passed since Loma Linda treated the first cancer patient with the world's first proton accelerator dedicated to radiation therapy. Since that time, over 1000 patients have completed treatments and the facility currently treats more than 45 patients per day. With a typical intensity of 3 x 10(10) protons per pulse and 27 pulses per minute, dose rates of 90-100 cGy/min are easily achieved on a 20-cm diameter field. In most cases, patient treatment times are 2 min, much less than the patient alignment time required before each treatment. Nevertheless, there is considerable medical interest in increasing field sizes up to 40-cm diameter while keeping dose rates high and treatment times low. In this article, beam measurements relevant to intensity studies are presented and possible accelerator modifications for upgrades are proposed. It is shown that nearly all intensity losses can be ascribed to the large momentum spread of the injected beam and occur at or near the injection energy of 2 MeV. The agreement between calculations and measurements appears quite good. In addition, optimum beam characteristics for a new injector are discussed based upon the momentum acceptance and space charge limits of the Loma Linda synchrotron	
0	3108	Comparative treatment planning between proton and X-ray therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	Aged, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, Risk, Sweden, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage X-rays and protons for medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of X-rays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed	
0	1421	[Comparison with dose-volume histograms of two conformal irradiation techniques used for the treatment of T2N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer, one with association of photons and protons and another with photons alone]. [French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

Oncologically the combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy offers an alternative treatment option. The functional results and the complication rate in stage III and IV tumors of the oral tongue, floor of mouth and oropharynx are described in a patients series. METHOD: The follow-up includes 17 consecutive patients who were primarily treated by a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy between 1997 and 2000. The oncological benefit (complete remission, disease-free survival), the functional results (mastication, swallowing, speech and pain) and the complications were reviewed. RESULTS: After the follow-up period 16/17 patients were alive. There were 3 major complications, one of them lethal. The functional results resembled those after surgical resections. CONCLUSIONS: A combined radiotherapy is a feasible method of treating patients who refrain from surgery. Moreover the application ranges from inoperability to postoperative radiotherapy in cases with close or positive margins. In connection with neck-dissections and therapy of recurrent cancer major complications may occur. In contrast to the general opinion radiation therapy was not superior to surgical resection concerning functional sequelae

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass 10 cm in diameter in the region of the middle clivus enhanced inhomogeneously by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and a defect in the skull base. There was evidence of compression of the anterior surface of the pons. He received proton irradiation employing a pair of parallel opposed lateral proton beams. The dose aimed at the tumor mass was 75.5 Gy, to the pharyngeal wall less than 38 Gy, and to the anterior portion of the pons less than 30 Gy. Time dose and fractionation factor was calculated at 148. Thirty-one months following treatment, he was free of clinical neurological sequelae. Proton therapy should be considered in treatment planning following initial surgical removal or for inoperable clivus chordoma

Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	In a study to evaluate the effect of increasing dose per fraction on radiation response in rectal cancer, two groups of 29 patients each, matched for extent and size of disease, were evaluated. Group A was treated with conventional dose/fraction (180-200 cGy) X 5 days/week and Group B was treated with 250 cGy/fraction X 4 days/week. Total dose was reduced by 10% in Group B patients to allow comparison of biologically equivalent doses. Two categories of patients were analyzed in each group: patients receiving planned high dose preoperative radiation (4000-4500 cGy); and patients receiving high dose radiation for post-surgical recurrent tumors or locally advanced inoperable tumors (5500-6000 cGy). Tumor regression was markedly better in patients treated with the 250 cGy/fraction. Overall response (greater than 50% regression) was 35% (10/29) in Group A and 62% (18/29) in Group B. Nine of 10 patients in Group B, treated preoperatively, had greater than 50% regression in tumor size, with two patients having no evidence of disease on surgico-pathological evaluation. Six of 10 similar patients in Group A had greater than 50% tumor regression

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

The purpose of this study was to use proton MR spectroscopy to investigate serial changes in recurrent malignant gliomas after gamma knife radiosurgery to characterize tissue response to high-dose radiation. METHODS: Eighteen patients with recurrent gliomas were studied with MR imaging and 3D proton MR spectroscopic imaging at the time of radiosurgery and at regular time points thereafter. Choline (Cho) and N-acetyl aspartate levels were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis and compared with levels found in normal tissue and with levels observed at previous time points. The results of the spectral analysis were then compared with the radiologic findings. Statistical comparisons were precluded by the small sample sizes involved. RESULTS: Response within the gamma knife target was observed as a reduction of Cho levels and an increase in lactate/lipid levels, typically within 6 months of treatment. Increases in Cho correlated with poor radiologic response and suggested tumor recurrence, confirmed histologically in six cases. The development of a spectral abnormality preceded a coincident increase in contrast enhancement by 1 to 2 months in nine cases. CONCLUSION: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging provided diagnostic and monitoring information before and after radiosurgery. Evaluation of metabolic changes with proton MR spectroscopy and structural changes with MR imaging improved tissue discrimination and provided correlation with histologic findings

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22). When BNCT is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA and radiobiological considerations, promising clinical results have been obtained, although many problems and issues remain to be solved

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol	
0	1223	Stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and inverse treatment planning for advanced pleural mesothelioma. Feasibility and initial results	Aged, Feasibility Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Mesothelioma/mo [Mortality], Mesothelioma/ra [Radiography], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Pleural Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pleural Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pleural Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiography,Thoracic, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Software, Survival, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complex-shaped malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) with challenging volumes are extremely difficult to treat by conventional radiotherapy due to tolerance doses of the surrounding normal tissue. In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT	
1	3242	[Clinical investigation of indications in proton therapy]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities, Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The indications for curative treatment with proton therapy were investigated by the clinical results of 31 cancer patients treated with proton beams between 1983 and 1985 at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center of Tsukuba University. Many locally extended, radioresistant lesions, lesions with large volume and small radiocurable lesions in this series revealed sufficient improvement without definite late damage in the surrounding normal tissues. This clinical result suggests that proton beam treatment could be applied to lesions in a much wider range for curative purposes as compared with conventional radiotherapy. This study is to be continued further

The proposed fractionation strategy consisted of a SIB treatment following a first phase of conventional fractionation to the elective volume (named SEQ/SIB). The novel method was compared to a conventional sequential fractionation and to a full SIB approach. Treatment plans were designed for five patients on the proton planning system developed for spot scanning at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Villigen (CH). Three to five beams were applied for all plans and fractionations. All effective dose distributions were corrected using biological models to take into account repopulation and time at repopulation onset. Corrected and uncorrected plans were compared on the basis of dosimetry criteria and dose-volume histograms. The results showed a dosimetric advantage for the SEQ/SIB approach in terms of target coverage, without significant disadvantages for risk structures and healthy tissue. Considering the high logistic impact and the limited availability of radiation facilities, the clinical exploitation of accelerated SIB treatment with protons appears promising	
0	2908	Proton irradiation of malignant melanoma of the ciliary body	Ciliary Body, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Ultrasonography	This is our first case of malignant melanoma of the ciliary body treated with proton beam irradiation, a technique that we developed for irradiating choroidal melanomas. After 21 months of follow-up no growth of the tumour has been observed, and shrinkage of the tumour was noted on the follow-up photographs and by ultrasonography. The 32P uptake test, which was positive before treatment, turned negative 14 months after irradiation. The described technique of proton beam irradiation might offer an alternative for the treatment of ciliary body melanomas when the present techniques of iridocyclectomy cannot be applied because of the size of the lesion

Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

The indications for double-dose irradiation with the same radio-element corresponded to "macroscopically abnormal" situations: immediate and prolonged radioresistance, recurrence or secondary radioresistance. Thirteen cases are called series 1 (Ruthenium) and 6 cases are called series 2 (protons). The series 1 allows a more reliable study as far as follow-up is higher (5.8 to 7.5 years) than in series 2 where the follow-up is shorter (13.6 to 29 months). Although double-dose irradiation was macroscopically efficient in 11 out of 13 cases in series 1, and in 3 out of 6 cases in series 2 (stabilization or decrease of tumour height measured before the second therapeutic session), 2 patients are deceased and 1 has a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of Ruthenium serie. Another one has also a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of protons series. Nevertheless double-dose radiotherapy allows a complementary decrease or stabilization of tumour height after a first session. It also decreases the indications for enucleation if there is no severe anatomic complications, when a tumour does not regress or recurs after a first session of radiations

This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

METHODS: Forty-eight eyes of 46 consecutive patients with subfoveal CNVM due to ARMD, not amenable to laser photocoagulation, were treated prospectively with a single proton beam exposure. Two dose regimens were evaluated: 8 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) and 14 CGE. Patients were followed for an average of 22.1 months after proton beam treatment. RESULTS: At the 12 month follow-up, 44% of eyes in the 8 CGE group and 75% of the eyes in the 14 CGE group had stabilized or improved visual acuity. Complex size in the 8 CGE group as measured on standard fluorescein angiography (FA), decreased or had no change initially but showed less effect over time, while the eyes treated with 14 CGE maintained decreased leakage over the follow-up period of 12 months. However, 11 eyes in the 14 CGE group experienced radiation retinopathy, with the onset between 3 and 30 months. Seven of these 11 eyes have demonstrated some visual loss but only 1 eye developed severe visual loss at 15 months after proton treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To date, 14 CGE has suggested a favourable influence on visual function and growth inhibition of CNVM. Proton beam irradiation appears to inhibit CNVM growth. The 14 CGE dose regimen appears to have a longer effect of CNVM growth than does 8 CGE, with overall stabilisation of visual function and growth inhibition. Radiation retinopathy has developed over time, but severe visual loss has been limited. On the basis of the incidence of radiation retinopathy, adjustments in the total radiation dosage and/or fractionation of the dosage should be considered

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I/II dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy. Fifty-seven patients with 64 sites of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for resection received carbon ion radiotherapy. Tumors involved the spine or paraspinous soft tissues in 19 patients, pelvis in 32 patients, and extremities in six patients. The total dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 gray equivalent (GyE) and was administered in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks (3.3 to 4.6 GyE/fraction). The median tumor size was 559 cm(3) (range, 20 to 2,290 cm(3)). The minimum follow-up was 18 months. RESULTS: Seven of 17 patients treated with the highest total dose of 73.6 GyE experienced Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 acute skin reactions. Dose escalation was then halted at this level. No other severe acute reactions (grade > 3) were observed in this series. The overall local control rates were 88% and 73% at 1 year and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. The median survival time was 31 months (range, 2 to 60 months), and the 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 82% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy seems to be a safe and effective modality in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcomas not eligible for surgical resection, providing good local control and offering a survival advantage without unacceptable morbidity

The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients (48 lesions) and nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were applied in the carbon dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 gray equivalents (GyE) by a 10% increment and from 68.4 to 79.2GyE by a 5% increment, respectively. The radiation target consisted of primary tumor. Image analysis of the patients with local recurrence was systematically performed after the treatment by focusing attention on the enhanced thin slice CT images of the primary lesion. By superimposing the dose distribution on the planning CT image and marking the anatomically identified loci of recurrence, it was possible to establish the relationship between the dose distribution and the incipient loci of recurrence and to classify the recurrence patterns from the differences in the recurrence loci. RESULTS: Local recurrence was found in 19 (23.2%) out of a total of 82 lesions. It is possible to distinguish between three recurrence patterns: Pattern 1 representing marginal recurrence and patterns 2a and 2b, which are both instances of in-field recurrence. In pattern 1, four recurrences take place from a region on the upper tumor margin. In pattern 2a, 13 recurrences take place from the center of the tumor. In pattern 2b, two recurrences take place from the near-center of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: For the 15 in-field recurrence lesions (patterns 2a and 2b) after excluding the four marginal recurrence lesions (patterns 1), we have established that the local control shows dose-dependence. Based on this, we have determined the optimal therapeutic dose

Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CRT) is a promising modality because of its excellent dose localization and high biological effect on tumors. This study aims to analyze the relationship between dosimetric factors developed for XRT and the incidence of RP in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after CRT. We examined 80 inoperable patients with NSCLC. The ranges of the daily fraction sizes and the total doses were from 3.3 to 8.8 GyE and from 59.4 to 95.4 GyE, respectively. These doses were successfully delivered with acceptable toxicity; >or= grade 2 RP was observed in 8 patients (10%). The severity of RP was graded within 6 months of the initiation of CRT using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. These results indicate the excellent dose distribution of CRT. We then compared the dosimetric data of the 8 patients developed >or= grade 2 RP with those of 72 patients developed <or= grade 1 RP. Dosimetric factors useful for predicting RP in XRT, such as the percentage of the computed tomography-defined total lung volume receiving > 5, > 20, and > 30 GyE, and mean lung dose, were not predictive factors for RP after CRT. The dosimetric factors used for XRT are not applicable for CRT in patients with NSCLC. The dosimetric factors for CRT remain to be developed

Short-term effects at 2 months following treatment were studied in a further three patients. MRI abnormalities were observed in nine patients. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls (n = 17) were seen in any of the calculated 1H-MRS metabolite ratios, in any of the three patient groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis there was a correlation between the choline/water ratio and a low IQ. It is concluded that any systematic radiation-induced changes in the 1H MRS metabolites must be below the detection threshold of this study

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

Prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck is a criterion of treatment for these patients. But some authors suggest to prophylactically irradiate the the whole neck. This study was to analyze and compare long-term outcomes of the N0-NPC patients treated by prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck and to the whole neck, and explore radiotherapy on neck for N0-NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 178 N0-NPC patients, proved by pathology, were treated in our hospital from Jul. 1998 to Dec. 1999. Of the 178 patients, 88 received prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck (upper neck group), 90 received prophylactic irradiation to the whole neck (whole neck group). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze and compare survival rate of the 2 groups. Cox model was used to study prognostic factors of N0-NPC. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 90.9%, and 80.7% in upper neck group, and 97.8%, 80.0%, and 71.1% in whole neck group (P = 0.224). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 93.2%, 80.7%, and 77.3% in upper neck group, and 85.6%, 68.9%, and 64.4% in whole neck group (P = 0.163). The incidence of cervical lymph nodes recurrence was 1.14% in upper neck group, and 1.09% in whole neck group (P> 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, and short-term outcome were independent prognostic factors of N0-NPC. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic irradiation to upper neck is recommended for N0-NPC patients	
1	2193	Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with linear accelerator for uveal melanoma--preliminary Vienna results	Austria, Ciliary Body, Dose Fractionation, Eye, Fixation,Ocular, Follow-Up Studies, France, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Melanoma, Melanoma/pp [Physiopathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Movement, Particle Accelerators, Radiotherapy, Safety, Stereotaxic Techniques, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Video Recording	PURPOSE: To study local tumor control and radiogenic side-effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and February 1998, 21 patients suffering from uveal melanomas have been treated with stereotactic 6 MeV LINAC (Saturne 43, General Electric, France) in conjunction with a stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB, Germany). Immobilization of the eye was ensured with an optical fixation system which was proven reliable. During radiotherapy, movements of the irradiated eye were controlled on a monitor and documented by video recording. All patients co-operated very well with the optical fixation system. In 1164 measurements, the median value of horizontal deviation of the diseased eye during treatment was 0.3 mm (range: 0 to 1.3 mm). Median vertical deviation was 0.2 mm (range: 0 to 1.2 mm). For all patients, mean tumor prominence before treatment was 6.0 +/- 2.2 mm. In 20 patients, the total dose of 70 Gy (at 80%) was delivered in 5 fractions within 10 days. In one patient with a ciliary body tumor, the total dose of 70 Gy was divided into 7 fractions for better sparing of the anterior eye segment. RESULTS: After a follow-up of at least 6 months, local tumor control was seen in all eyes. Mean tumor thickness reduction after 3, 6 and 9 months was 7%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Up to now, only mild subacute side-effects located in the anterior eye segment have been noticed. CONCLUSION: Optical fixation of the eye allows high precision stereotactic radiotherapy with small safety margins. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and 70 Gy total dose delivered in 5 fractions seems to be appropriate for local tumor control in uveal melanoma. Further long-term studies with extended number of patients will be necessary to conclude on the use of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	
0	885	Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children	California, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Count, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pilot Projects, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer received accelerated photon and proton radiation, 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions/5.5 weeks, to the primary disease, involved lymph nodes, and potential areas of subclinical spread. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months. RESULTS: Five-year actuarial control for local disease was 88%, and for neck node disease, 96%; yielding a 84% locoregional control rate at 5 years. Four patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 84%. The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival rate was 81%; at 5 years, it was 65%. All patients completed the prescribed treatment; though aggressive nutritional and anesthetic support was necessary. Late Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Protons used as a concomitant boost with photons effectively delivered an accelerated time-dose schedule to the cancer with a more tolerable schedule to surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary results reveal increased locoregional control without increased toxicity. Future studies must evaluate the optimum time-dose schedule

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers	
0	4667	Radiation therapy in the management of locally advanced prostate cancer. [Review] [37 refs]	Chemotherapy,Adjuvant, Clinical Trials as Topic, Disease Progression, Humans, Male, Patients, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Risk, Universities, Washington	Locally advanced prostate cancer generally refers to those patients with clinical stages T3-4 disease. Patients with locally advanced cancer frequently are included in clinical trials that examine treatment for patients at high risk for relapse based on presenting prostate-specific antigen, high Gleason score, or advanced clinical stage. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that men with localized prostate cancer benefit from high-dose radiation therapy delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or proton beam therapy. Most importantly, neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy have significantly improved outcomes in men with locally advanced or high-risk prostate cancer. Although questions remain regarding the optimal timing and duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy, a combination of long-term androgen deprivation started before radiation therapy and continued for 2 years represents a North American standard of care for this patient population.

Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

When it was diagnosed, it measured 6mm in thickness and 11.9mm for the largest diameter and had a typical mushroom shape. General investigations found no metastatic disease. It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment. Neovascular glaucoma is a major complication that very often leads to enucleation

The patient maintained good vision until 18 months after therapy, when she developed neovascular glaucoma. This complication required multiple therapeutic procedures, including topical anti-inflammatory and antiglaucomatous drops, 360 degrees peripheral panretinal cryoblation, and a single 180 degrees application of inferior cyclocryotherapy over a 2 1/2-year period. Four weeks after the cyclocryotherapy, inflammation was noted in both eyes, and, one month later, enucleation of the left sympathogenic eye was performed. Serial histopathologic sections showed a full-thickness, fibrovascular, scleral scar and tantalum marker ring suture without uveal incarceration. Penetrating surgical trauma, a uveal melanoma, and multiple nonpenetrating treatments resulted in the development of sympathetic ophthalmia

The technique used to achieve these results was simplified through the physical characteristics of the radioelement and the optimized-dosimetry program employed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 78 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine 125. About 100 Gy were delivered to the superior pole of the tumour. The minimal length of follow-up was 17 months and the average, 67 months. RESULTS: There was 88% local control, leading to lowered visual acuity in 76% of the cases. Radiation retinopathy, directly related to proximity to the macula, is the principle etiology. Seven patients died of hepatic metastasis, five patients were enucleated. Four patients were further treated with protontherapy to make up for noncontrol locally. CONCLUSION: One dose of 100 Gy to the superior pole of the tumor seemed to lead to good local control, with the exception of complications related to proximity to the macula and the optic nerve. In this attempt to optimize irradiation, the time lapse between any benefit in local control derived from irradiation and posttherapeutic complications observed remains insufficient to evaluate any relationship

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, comparative treatment planning was performed by comparing proton plans and related conventional, conformal, and IMRT photon plans. The evaluations analyzed dose-volume histogram findings of the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs, i.e., pituitary gland, optical pathway structures, brain, nontarget tissue). RESULTS: The mean and maximal doses, dose inhomogeneities, and conformity indexes for the planning target volumes were comparable for all techniques. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of irradiated nontarget tissues at the 10-70% dose level compared with the corresponding proton plans. The volumes thereby increased by a factor of 1.3-3.1 for conventional, 1.1-3.8 for conformal, and 1.1-3.7 for IMRT. Compared with conventional techniques, conformal and IMRT photon treatment planning options similarly reduced the mean dose to the OARs. The use of protons further reduced the mean dose to the OARs by up to 65% and 62% compared with the conformal and IMRT technique, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment techniques, conformal RT and IMRT similarly enabled dose reductions to the OARs. Additional improvements were obtained using proton-based treatment planning modalities

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body	
0	4077	Definitive proton beam radiation therapy for inoperable gastric cancer: a report of two cases	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Japan, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Stomach Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Stomach Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach Ulcer/di [Diagnosis], Stomach Ulcer/pa [Pathology], Stomach/pa [Pathology], Universities	Proton beam radiation therapy using 250 MeV protons was carried out on two patients with early gastric cancer (T1, N0, M0). One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

Since November 1987, 26 patients with resectable gastric cancer were irradiated intraoperatively with the linear accelerator using fast electrons (single dose: 12 to 16 Gy). Percutaneous radiotherapy was performed postoperatively with 24 to 38 Gy (4 x 2 Gy per week). For intraoperative and percutaneous radiotherapy the target absorbed dose was selected in a way that their combined effect on the tumor was approximately equivalent to that of a total dose of 60 Gy in the usual fractionating. Up to now, the median survival time for stage III patients (UICC 1987) has been twelve months. In five patients who died of a relapse or of peritoneal carcinosis, histologic evaluation revealed in every case a diffuse tumor type according to Lauren-classification. All relapses occurred within the first eight months. The two-year survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier is 67% for stage III. Advanced resectable gastric cancer of the intestinal tumor type seems to profit from adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy.

It identifies the risk factors for local tumor-control failure and for ocular tumor-related death. It presents the improvements implemented to increase the rate of local tumor control, and compares the survival rate of patients with locally controlled tumors to those of patients who had to receive a second treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated 2,435 uveal melanomas with PBRT between March 1984 and December 1998. Data were analyzed as of September 1999. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 89 years; there were 1,188 men and 1,247 women. The largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 26 mm, and tumor thickness from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 40 months. RESULTS: Local tumor control probability at 5 years was improved from 90.6 +/- 1.7% for patients treated before 1988, to 96.3 +/- 0.6% for patients treated between 1989 and 1993, and became 98.9 +/- 0.6% for patients treated after 1993. Among 2,435 treated patients, 73 (3%) had to receive a second treatment because of tumor regrowth. Cause-specific survival at 10 years was calculated to 72.6 +/- 1.9% for patients with controlled tumors compared to 47.5 +/- 6.5% for those with recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: Reduced safety margins, large ciliary body tumors, eyelids within the treatment field, inadequate positioning of tantalum clips, and male gender were identified to be the main factors impairing local tumor control. The improvement of local tumor control rate after 1993 is attributed to changes implemented in the treatment procedure. Our data strongly support that the rate of death by metastases is influenced by local tumor control failure: improvement of the local tumor control rate results in a better survival rate

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy	
1	163	Survival implications of enucleation after definitive radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma: an example of regression on time-dependent covariates	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cobalt Radioisotopes, Cobalt Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cohort Studies, Dose Fractionation, Eye Enucleation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiotherapy, Regression Analysis, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Failure	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the removal of the eye after radiotherapy alters the rates of metastatic death in patients with melanoma of the choroid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an extension of the Cox model, we based our analysis on a cohort of 1541 consecutive patients with unilateral choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated with protons (70 cobalt-gray equivalent in 5 to 7 fractions) at the Harvard University (Boston, Mass) cyclotron between July 1, 1975, through December 31, 1993, and who were observed prospectively up to September 30, 1995. Patient survival and the status of the treated eye were updated annually. RESULTS: By September 1995 (median follow-up among survivors, 8 years), 137 patients underwent enucleation after radiotherapy for complications (n=103) or tumor regrowth (n=34). The overall 10-year rate of eye retention was 89% (95% confidence interval, 87%-91%). Of the 1541 patients, 300 died of tumor metastasis, 38 following enucleation of the affected eye (mean interval from enucleation to death, 25 months). The multivariate rate ratio for metastatic death associated with enucleation (modeled as a time-dependent covariate) was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4) for enucleation due to complications and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-6.3) for enucleation associated with tumor regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of tumor viability, enucleation after primary irradiation for choroidal melanoma has no deleterious effect on patients' survival. Enucleation concurrent with tumor regrowth is associated with high death rates; growth of the tumor in the eye may presage systemic recurrence and death from metastasis

We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone	
0	3433	Whole abdominal irradiation for tumors of the uterine corpus	Abdomen, Boston, Combined Modality Therapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hysterectomy, Lymphatic Metastasis, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Postoperative Care, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Risk, Sarcoma, Survival, Survivors, Uterine Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Between November 1981 and December 1985, 16 patients with high-risk tumors of the uterine corpus were treated with a postoperative course of whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation. Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy	
1	2516	15 years experience with helium ion radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Survival, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To review the long-term experience of helium ion therapy as a therapeutic alternative to enucleation for uveal melanoma, particularly with respect to survival, local control, and morbidity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)	
1	674	Results of spot-scanning proton radiation therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base: the Paul Scherrer Institut experience	Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Carbon, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Switzerland, Time, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To assess the clinical results of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PT) in the treatment of skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas (CS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up	
1	1035	Clinical outcomes of stereotactic radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer using a novel irradiation technique: patient self-controlled breath-hold and beam switching using a combination of linear accelerator and CT scanner	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Non-Small-Cell Lung/su [Surgery], Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Ireland, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Lung Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Male, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Respiration, Self Care, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome	We have developed a novel irradiation technique for lung cancer that combines a linear accelerator and CT scanner with patient-controlled breath-hold and radiation beam switching. We applied this technique to stereotactic three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluated the primary therapeutic outcomes. A total of 35 patients with stage I (15 IA, 20 IB) primary NSCLC (20 adeno, 13 squamous cell, and 2 others) were treated with this technique. Patients ranged from 65 to 92 years old (median, 78 years). Twenty-three (66%) patients were medically inoperable due to mainly chronic pulmonary disease or high age. Three-dimensional treatment plans were made using 10 different non-coplanar dynamic arcs. The total dose of 60 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions (over 5-8 days) at the minimum dose point in the planning target volume (PTV) using a 6 MV X-ray. After adjusting the isocenter of the PTV to the planned position by a unit comprising CT and linear accelerator, irradiation was performed under patient-controlled breath-hold and radiation beam switching. All patients completed the treatment course without complaint. Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 8/35 (23%) and 25/35 (71%), respectively. Pulmonary complications of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria grade >2 were noted in three (9%) patients. During follow-up (range, 6-30 months; median, 13 months), two (6%) patients developed local progression and five (14%) developed distant or regional lymph node metastases. Two-year overall survival rates for total patients and medically operable patients were 58 and 83%, respectively. In conclusion, this new irradiation technique, utilizing patient-controlled radiation beam switching under self-breath-hold after precise alignment of the isocenter, allows safe high-dose stereotactic radiotherapy with sufficient margins around the CTV and reduced treatment times. Based on the initial results, excellent local control with minimal complications is expected for stage I NSCLC. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

Measurements were made on neck node metastases during the radiation treatment period in 47 patients. Tumors with a slow regression rate were shown to have a high probability of recurrence. The results indicate that accurate measurements of the regression rate provide prognostic information, which is obtained early enough for the radiotherapist to consider additional treatment

Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated

The colon was examined roentgeno-endoscopically in all these cases. As a result of the radiation treatment a marked clinical effect was noted in 94 patients, while in 12 cases locally-unresectable tumors were rendered resectable. 77 patients were radically operated upon, and a morphological assay of the operation specimens indicated significant changes arising in the tumor tissue due to the effect of ionizing radiation.

Feasibility and initial results	Aged, Feasibility Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Mesothelioma/mo [Mortality], Mesothelioma/ra [Radiography], Mesothelioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Pleural Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Pleural Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Pleural Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiography,Thoracic, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Software, Survival, Time, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complex-shaped malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) with challenging volumes are extremely difficult to treat by conventional radiotherapy due to tolerance doses of the surrounding normal tissue. In a feasibility study, we evaluated if inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) could be applied in the treatment of MPM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with unresectable lesions were treated after failure of chemotherapy. All patients were positioned using noninvasive patient fixation techniques which can be attached to the applied extracranial stereotactic system. Due to craniocaudal extension of the tumor, it was necessary to develop a special software attached to the inverse planning program KonRad, which can connect two inverse treatment plans and consider the applied dose of the first treatment plan in the area of the matchline of the second treatment plan. RESULTS: Except for one patient, in whom radiotherapy was canceled due to abdominal metastasis, treatment could be completed in all patients and was well tolerated. Median survival after diagnosis was 20 months and after IMRT 6.5 months. Therefore, both the 1-year actuarial overall survival from the start of radiotherapy and the 2-year actuarial overall survival since diagnosis were 28%. IMRT did not result in clinically significant acute side effects. By using the described inverse planning software, over or underdosage in the region of the field matchline could be prevented. Pure treatment time ranged between 10 and 21 min. CONCLUSION: This study showed that IMRT is feasible in advanced unresectable MPM. The presented possibilities of stereotactic IMRT in the treatment of MPM will justify the evaluation of IMRT in early-stage pleural mesothelioma combined with chemotherapy in a study protocol, in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, dose escalation should be possible by using IMRT	
1	4290	Proton therapy in Japan	Adult, Aged, Clinical Trials as Topic, Female, Gamma Rays, Glioblastoma, Humans, Japan, Male, Melanoma, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Photons, Protons, Radiation, Radiodermatitis/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Relative Biological Effectiveness, Science, Universities	There are two facilities for clinical trials with protons in Japan: the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Chiba, and the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center (PARMS), University of Tsukuba. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, patient treatment with the 70 MeV proton beam began in November 1979, and 29 patients were treated through December 1984. Of 11 patients who received protons only, 9 have had local control of the tumor. Two of the 9 patients, suffering from recurrent tumor after radical photon beam irradiation, developed complications after proton treatment. In the patients treated with photons or neutrons followed by proton boost, tumors were controlled in 12 of 18 patients (66.6%), and no complications were observed in this series. Malignant melanoma could not be controlled with the proton beam. A spot-beam-scanning system for protons has been effectively used in the clinical trials to minimize the dose to the normal tissues and to concentrate the dose in the target volume. At the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center, University of Tsukuba, treatment with a vertical 250 MeV proton beam was begun in April 1983, and 22 patients were treated through February 1984. Local control of the tumor was observed in 14 of 22 patients (63.6%), whereas there was no local control in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. There have been no severe complications in patients treated at PARMS. The results suggest that local control of tumors will be better with proton beams than with photon beams, whereas additional modalities are required to manage radioresistant tumors	
0	3108	Comparative treatment planning between proton and X-ray therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	Aged, Female, Head, Humans, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/is [Instrumentation], Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Research, Risk, Sweden, Universities, X-Ray Therapy, X-Rays	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage X-rays and protons for medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of X-rays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three dose plans were made for each of the six patients: one proton plan, including three beams covering the primary tumour and adjacent lymph nodes and three boost beams covering the primary tumour: one X-ray plan, eight beams including a boost with four beams and one mixed plan with four X-ray beams and a boost with three proton beams. A three dimensional treatment-planning systems, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the biological models TCP and NTCP on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of X-rays for all six patients, but in three of them, the advantage is only marginal. The dose-limiting organ at risk is the small bowel, but the proton plan and the mixed plan also spare the bladder and the femoral heads better. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the six patients is increased by 14%-units with the proton plan and 8%-units with the mixed plan compared to X-rays only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy has potential advantages when treating medically inoperable patients with a large rectal cancer over conventional X-ray therapy. Since the benefits are comparatively small, although clinically worthwhile, large randomised studies are needed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and August 1998 we treated 35 patients with stage cT1-3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. Thirty-two patients with a follow-up of 12 to 28 months (median: 18 months) were evaluated. After ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of 4 non-parallel needles, CT based 3D brachytherapy treatment planning ("Offenbach system") was performed. All patients received 4 fractions brachytherapy using a fractional dose of 5 or 7 Gy. Time between each fraction was 14 days. After brachytherapy 3D external irradiation followed up to 39.6 or 45.0 Gy. All patients received androgen deprivation, starting 2 to 19 months before brachytherapy, ending 3 months after 3D external radiotherapy. RESULTS: Posttreatment PSA levels dropped to < 1.5 ng/ml in 29/32 patients (91%). In 25 patients PSA levels were < 0.5 ng/ml, in 4 patients 0.5 to 1.5 ng/ml. In 2 patients we noted biochemical relapse. Transrectal implantation was very well tolerated. Grade 3 acute urinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient. We noted no Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient developed a Grade 3 late urinary toxicity. No patient showed late gastrointestinal side effects. All 140 dose-volume histograms for 3D HDR brachytherapy were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The new 3D HDR brachytherapy technique, combined with 3D external irradiation and androgen deprivation, is a feasible, so far well-tolerated and effective treatment in the short-time follow-up of median 18 months	
1	3341	On the use of effective dose in the treatment planning of high linear-energy-transfer radiation	Algorithms, Biometry, British Columbia, Canada, Energy Transfer, Health Physics, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Mesons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Research, Universities	Treatment planning for conventional radiations is based on the assumption that the effect of a combination of doses at any location in the treatment field in a multibeam plan will be equivalent to that of a single dose made up of the total sum of the doses delivered to that location. This is obviously valid for conventional low linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiations when the dose contributions from various beam components are associated with the same relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value of unity. However, this is not the case for the new generation of charged particle beams whose RBEs have been shown to vary significantly with depth. A concept of effective dose, defined as the mathematical product of physical dose and RBE value evaluated for an effect level, is developed for the treatment planning of these high-LET particle radiations. Based on radiobiological results in mixed radiation experiments, it is shown that these effective doses are linearly additive like physical doses and hence, can be used directly for general treatment planning using linear algorithms already developed for the use of physical doses. This is illustrated using examples of simplified one-dimensional plans for the TRIUMF pion beam

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

In short-term follow-up (less than 5 years), more than 90% (18/19) of treated patients demonstrated tumor regression. We had to enucleate five eyes after helium ion therapy either because of continued tumor growth (four patients) or other complications (one patient). Two melanomas continued to grow and seemed to be radioresistant. In two other tumors it retrospectively seemed that the entire lesion was not inside the radiation field. In one patient total retinal detachment and glaucoma developed; enucleation was performed because of a painful eye. Metastatic disease developed in no patients. The treatment failures emphasize that there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the use of charged-particle irradiation in the treatment of melanoma. Further studies must be performed to answer these questions and better delineate the use of these newer forms of therapy

Oncologically the combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy offers an alternative treatment option. The functional results and the complication rate in stage III and IV tumors of the oral tongue, floor of mouth and oropharynx are described in a patients series. METHOD: The follow-up includes 17 consecutive patients who were primarily treated by a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy between 1997 and 2000. The oncological benefit (complete remission, disease-free survival), the functional results (mastication, swallowing, speech and pain) and the complications were reviewed. RESULTS: After the follow-up period 16/17 patients were alive. There were 3 major complications, one of them lethal. The functional results resembled those after surgical resections. CONCLUSIONS: A combined radiotherapy is a feasible method of treating patients who refrain from surgery. Moreover the application ranges from inoperability to postoperative radiotherapy in cases with close or positive margins. In connection with neck-dissections and therapy of recurrent cancer major complications may occur. In contrast to the general opinion radiation therapy was not superior to surgical resection concerning functional sequelae	
0	1900	Proton radiation therapy (PRT) for pediatric optic pathway gliomas: comparison with 3D planned conventional photons and a standard photon technique	Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Optic Chiasm, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%, and 25% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (<20 cm3) and larger (> 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47% and 77% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11% and 16%) and pituitary gland (13% and 16%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39% and 54%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT. CONCLUSION: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

METHODS: Patients with invasive bladder cancer, stage T2-3N0M0, were included in the study. Intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed with three injections of methotrexate and cisplatin at 3-week intervals. Simultaneously, the patients underwent X-ray irradiation (40 Gy) of the small pelvic space. Where a post-treatment transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy showed no residual tumor, the tumor site was irradiated by a 30 Gy proton beam and the bladder was preserved. Where tumors remained, radical cystectomy was performed. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1996, 42 patients were treated according to this protocol. Post-treatment TUR biopsy and urine cytology showed no residual tumors in 39 of 42 cases (93%). The bladder was preserved in accordance with the study protocol in 36 cases. A median follow-up of 38 months showed 3-year non-recurrence in 72% of bladder-preserved patients and the rate of bladder preservation was 84%. The nine recurrences included eight cases of superficial bladder recurrence. One cancer death occurred among the bladder-preservation patients, giving 3-year survival and cause-specific survival rates of 84% and 100%, respectively. Although bladder function decreased slightly in compliance, bladder capacity was retained in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is useful for bladder preservation in T2-3 locally invasive bladder cancer. Information from more cases and the results of more long-term observations are needed, as is an evaluation of appropriate subject selection and factors associated with quality of life issues, particularly regarding bladder function

Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan

RT consisted of 3600 to 4500 cGy external pelvic treatments on a 6-MeV linear accelerator followed by two intracavitary applications administering a total of 4000 mg hr of radium equivalent cesium. CT consisted of a course of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 iv bolus) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU; 1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the second week of external RT and another course of cis-platinum (CDDP; 75 mg/m2, 1-6 hr infusion) and 5FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the first intracavitary cesium application. Toxicity was acceptable and complete clinical response was obtained in all patients at the end of the regimen. Nine patients are alive (eight without disease) 6 to 37 months following initiation of treatment (median 20 months). One patient has developed lumbar spine bone metastases and another died of local and pulmonary disease at 28 months. This combination of 5FU/mitomycin C/CDDP and RT appears to be a practical, well-tolerated, and highly effective regimen for advanced cervical carcinoma

A progressive reduction in glandular volume (of low, medium, and high grade) was observed in 48/50 patients respectively within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and 6-9 months after treatment. After 9 months only lesser modifications were observed. A statistically significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between volume decrease percentage and histologic grading of the tumor, but not with its stage. Within the groups of patients affected with similar-grade neoplasms, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) was observed, relative to the decrease rate of prostatic volume, between the patients with complete response and those with partial or no response. US monitoring of prostatic volume after radiotherapy, if correlated with histologic grading, can yield early predictive elements as to treatment outcome, thus contributing to select non-responsive patients to submit to biopsy and, if necessary, to therapeutic alternatives or combinations. Longer-term studies are needed to prove its effectiveness, to prognostic purposes, in the single patient	
1	1757	Treatment planning for heavy ion radiotherapy: clinical implementation and application	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Carbon, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Head, Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Physics, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity, Uncertainty	The clinical implementation and application of a novel treatment planning system (TPS) for scanned ion beams is described, which is in clinical use for carbon ion treatments at the German heavy ion facility (GSI). All treatment plans are evaluated on the basis of biologically effective dose distributions. For therapy control, in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) and an online monitoring system for the beam intensity and position are used. The absence of a gantry restricts the treatment plans to horizontal beams. Most of the treatment plans consist of two nearly opposing lateral fields or sometimes orthogonal fields. In only a very few cases a single beam was used. For patients with very complex target volumes lateral and even distal field patching techniques were applied. Additional improvements can be achieved when the patient's head is fixed in a tilted position, in order to achieve sparing of the organs at risk. In order to test the stability of dose distributions in the case of patient misalignments we routinely simulate the effects of misalignments for patients with critical structures next to the target volume. The uncertainties in the range calculation are taken into account by a margin around the target volume of typically 2-3 mm, which can, however, be extended if the simulation demonstrates larger deviations. The novel TPS developed for scanned ion beams was introduced into clinical routine in December 1997 and was used for the treatment planning of 63 patients with head and neck tumours until July 2000. Planning strategies and methods were developed for this tumour location that facilitate the treatment of a larger number of patients with the scanned heavy ion beam in a clinical setting. Further developments aim towards a simultaneous optimization of the treatment field intensities and more effective procedures for the patient set-up. The results demonstrate that ion beams can be integrated into a clinical environment for treatment planning and delivery

The investigated parameters were leaf width in the MLC, leaf transmission, related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. Seven head-and-neck patients with stage T1-T3N0-N2cM0 oropharyngeal cancer were studied. For each patient nine plans were made with a different set of linac/MLC parameters. The plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) v7.6c and PLATO RTS v2.6.4, ITP v1.1.8. A hypothetical ideal linac/MLC was introduced to investigate the influence of one parameter at a time without interaction of other parameters. When any of the three parameters was increased from the ideal set-up values (leaf width 2.5 mm, transmission 0%, penumbra 3 mm), the mean dose to the parotid glands increased, given the same tumour coverage. The largest increase was found for increasing leaf transmission. The investigation showed that by changing more than one parameter of the ideal linac/MLC set-up, the increase in the mean dose was smaller than the sum of dose increments for each parameter separately. As a reference to clinical practice, we also optimized the plans of the seven patients with the clinically used Elekta SLi 15, equipped with a standard MLC with a leaf width of 10 mm. As compared to the ideal linac, this resulted in an increase of the average dose to the parotid glands of 5.8 Gy

Three regimens of fractionation were used: (1) accelerated fractionation (AF)--(133), 2.5 Gy, 3 days a week, to a total of 47.5--55 Gy; (2) accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF)--(93), 1.25 Gy, daily, to a total of 60-72.5 Gy and standard fractionation (SF)--(149), 2 Gy, daily, to a total of 58-68 Gy. The advantages of AHF were established as regards complete regression rate (54.9% vs. 18.6%--SF and 18.1%--AF; p(0.001), median survival (30.5(2.4 months vs. 18.9 (1%--SF (p = 0.004) and 20.4 (2.4--AF (p = 0.004)), and 3-year survival (36.6% vs. 16.7%--SF (p = 0.005) and 15.5%--AF (p = 0.005). 17.9%, 9.0% (p = 0.11) and 8.1% (p = 0.08) have survived, respectively. Overall survival in the AHF group was superior in stages IIB--III; in stage I, the results were identical. Immediate response to radical radiotherapy appeared the only statistically significant factor of survival (p = 0.005-0.008) in all the groups

Gross total resection with negative margins is rarely achieved, and the risks of functional, structural, and cosmetic deficits limit the radiation dose using conventional radiation techniques. Twenty-nine children and adolescents treated with conformal proton radiotherapy (proton RT) were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome

[Japanese]	Aged, Carbon, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Ions, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Pancreatectomy, Pancreatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Pancreatic Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Prognosis, Prostate, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant/mt [Methods], Recurrence	Prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still remarkably poor, even if complete resection was performed by enlarged abscission. On the other hand, carbon-ion beam therapy is giving good results in some selected carcinoma such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and soft tissue/bone tumor. In this report, we discuss four patients with pancreatic cancer treated by surgical pancreatectomy combined with preoperative carbon-ion beam irradiation. All patients were irradiated with 48 GyE carbon-iron beam by HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) to the pancreatic area including lymph nodes and nerve plexus. Severe cholangitis, as the postoperative complication, had occurred in one of the patients. However, there was no complication or disorder caused by carbon-iron radiation. All four patients are alive now, but two of them developed tumor recurrence, one with hepatic metastasis and the other with peritoneal dissemination. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer combined with preoperative carbon-ion irradiation is expected as a promising cure, but it is necessary to examine more cases in the future to evaluate the clinical outcome of this treatment

Patients were followed for eighteen to forty-five months with regard to progression of disease and development of long-term complications. Upstaging to Stage D1 by virtue of discovering pelvic node involvement was noted in 16 patients (53.3 per cent). Subsequent disease progression (defined as development of bone or soft tissue metastasis) was seen in 9 of 16 upstaged patients with an average time to progression of 12.2 months. Three Stage D1 patients have died with an average time to death of 19.6 months. Only 1 patient whose lymphadenectomy was negative has experienced disease progression, and none has died. Adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride) was given to 9 upstaged patients, in only 3 did disease progress. In contrast, in 6 of 7 upstaged patients not receiving chemotherapy metastatic disease developed, with an average time to progression of 10.3 months. In an attempt to improve local tumor control achieved by interstitial irradiation alone, 18 patients received additional external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, in doses ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 rad. There were sixteen long-term complications in the 30 patients, 75 per cent of which were seen in patients receiving added external beam irradiation

For these 30 cases, the diagnosis was made by B ultrasonography only when the volume of the extension was important, between 20 and 2280 mm3. The Cox model multi-variant analysis was used to study the statistically significant parameters in the development of an extrascleral extension. It appears that the maximal diameter of the intraocular tumor (p = 0.0012), the localisation of the anterior margin (p = 0.0304) and the age of the patients (p = 0.0097) are statistically meaningful. The 4 years' survival, studied with the Kaplan-Meier curves, is estimated at 60% for the patients with extrascleral extension and at 85% for the patients without. These results are similar to those of literature, whatever treatment is chosen (enucleation and radiotherapy, exenteration)

DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed

We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors. However, simultaneous individual anesthetic challenges require pediatric anesthesiologists highly experienced with the pediatric airway, clinical alertness and closed monitoring

Topographically, the tumor is located at the lower limbs (32.9%), the upper extremities (28%), and the head (26%). Involvement of the trunk is rare. Diagnosis can be complicated as the carcinoma is a rare entity, with no correlation of its histologic classification and biologic presentation. This can only implicate the difficulties in treatment

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

Surgical management is the primary therapeutic modality. With the use of modern surgical techniques, recurrence is infrequent, and facial nerve sparing is the norm. However, for patients with recurrent disease, the risk of further relapses is increased with surgical resection alone, particularly for those patients in whom multiple recurrences have already occurred. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting remains uncertain. Although neutron radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy for malignant salivary gland tumors, its role in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas is less well defined. We report our experience using this modality for high-risk, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. METHODS: Sixteen patients were treated with neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands from 1986 through 1993. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11-77 years); median age at the time of neutron radiotherapy was 52 years (range, 22-77 years); median number of prior surgical procedures was 3 (range, 1-6); median duration from initial diagnosis to radiotherapy was 14.5 years (range, 3 months-30 years); median follow-up was 83 months (range, 9-144 months). The median period at risk for survivors was 96 months (defined as the interval from completion of neutron radiotherapy to last follow-up). Ten patients had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment as determined by imaging studies, with nine patients having multinodular disease. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial survival was 79%. One patient died from lung metastases 9 months after treatment; one patient died from a liver tumor of uncertain origin, but the histology could not rule out a metastasis from the previous pleomorphic adenoma; and one patient died from recurrent disease at the base of skull. The 15-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 85%. One of the two patients with locoregional recurrence had a malignant transformation into an adenocarcinoma. No statistical difference in 15-year actuarial survival (75% vs 83%, p =.82) was found comparing patients with gross residual disease vs microscopic residual disease. The actuarial 15-year locoregional control was 76% for patients with gross residual disease vs 100% for those with microscopic disease. The 15-year actuarial risk of RTOG/ESTRO nonaudiologic grade III/IV complications was 21%. No facial nerve injuries were observed as a direct consequence of neutron radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron radiotherapy offers both excellent local control rates and survival rates in patients with multiply recurrent pleomorphic adenomas that are not candidates for surgical resection, even in the presence of gross residual disease. The treatment-related morbidity is acceptable. Malignant transformations and metastases, although uncommon, may be observed in this tumor. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Iodine 125 plaques were used to treat all uveal melanomas between the end of 1989 and 1991. Since 1991, we have used iodine plaques for small anterior tumors and proton beam for other tumors. We use a plaque with a larger diameter than the tumor diameter (2-4mm) with a dose of 90Gy at the apex. Proton beam therapy is used for all tumors at the equator or posterior to the equator not thicker than 12mm. The dose given is 60Gy cobalt equivalent in four fractions. For each patient, the initial size and location of the tumor were noted as well as the follow-up each year: the outcome for the eye (local recurrence, ocular conservation, and functional results), the occurrence of metastasis, and survival. A statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between December 1989 and September 1998, 1272 patients were treated: 926 (72.8%) were treated with proton beam irradiation and 346 (27.8%) with iodine 125 plaques. The median follow-up was 5 years (60 months). For the patients treated with proton beam therapy, the mean age was 58 years, the tumor location was anterior to the equator for 3.8%, at the equator for 43.6%, and posterior to the equator for 52.6%. The mean tumor diameter was 13.4mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.69mm. For the patients treated with iodine 125 plaques, the mean age was 61.5 years. The location of the tumor was anterior to the equator for 34.4%, at the equator for 46.5%, and posterior to the equator for 19.1%. The mean tumor diameter was 11.5mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.12mm. The recurrence rate was 4% for the proton beam treatment and 3.75% for iodine plaques. There was no statistical difference. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the rate of local recurrence is usually higher with iodine 125 plaques than proton beam therapy. We discuss the risk factors for local recurrence after iodine 125 plaques: tumor diameter, lower dose to the tumor apex and lower dose rate, and posterior location of the tumor. We found a higher mortality rate in patients who presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: When we use iodine 125 plaques for anterior tumors with the proper dose and dose rate to the apex of the tumor, we do not find more recurrence than with proton beam therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support continued investigation to confirm therapeutic efficacy

However, conventional photon-radiation treatment, as part of multimodality therapy, results in varying degrees of long-term functional and cosmetic side effects. This report introduces external beam proton radiation therapy (PRT) as a conformal, three-dimensional planned radiation technique for this disease, analyzes normal tissue dosimetry, and describes the technique's application in the first 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1996, 2 patients underwent PRT following biopsy and chemotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifty and 55 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) were delivered to the gross tumor volume and 40 CGE to clinical target volumes in both patients. A relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 was utilized to correlate proton dose calculations with CGE. To achieve dose conformity, a "patch technique" was utilized, where target regions were divided into segments, each treated by a separate proton field. Dose-volume histograms were obtained for target and nontarget regions, including lens, bony orbit, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, optic nerves, lacrimal gland, and ipsilateral frontal and temporal lobes. RESULTS: At 3.4 and 2.5 years after PRT, both patients are clinically and radiographically free of disease. Visual acuity remains excellent, without signs of cataract formation; pituitary function is normal; cosmetically, only mild enophthalmos is noticeable. Doses to 90%, 50%, and 5% of lens volume were kept at less than 1%, less than 2%, and less than 8%, respectively. Fifty percent of lacrimal gland volume received less than 36% of the prescribed dose and 50% of the volume of the optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus were restricted to less than 2%. Proton conformity to orbital contents resulted in between 9% and 36% of the prescribed dose reaching the ipsilateral temporal and frontal lobes immediately adjacent to bony orbit (5% volume). CONCLUSION: PRT can offer excellent sparing of lens and selected intraorbital and ocular normal structures, while maintaining conformal target-dose coverage. The steep dose gradient beyond the orbit minimizes irradiation of normal brain parenchyma, with almost complete sparing of the pituitary gland. Reduction of integral irradiation exposure of the periorbital region will, hopefully, reduce the risk of second malignancy later in life. Reduced radiation dose to specific organs in close proximity to, but not part of the target region promises improved functional outcome and better cosmesis for childhood cancer survivors

The CBCT projection data of a phantom were acquired during rotational megavoltage (MV) dose delivery up to 6 Gy to evaluate image quality under MV beam irradiation. A lung tumor patient was treated with a total dose of 48 Gy in four fractions, each fraction including seven coplanar and noncoplanar beams, as well as a full-angle rotational beam. Tumor registration was performed between a planning CT image and a CBCT image immediately after patient setup. The patient couch was adjusted according to the registration results, and then the registration was repeated three times: immediately before treatment, during treatment, and immediately after treatment. The phantom image quality of the kV CBCT was not visually degraded up to the rotational MV dose of 6 Gy. Tumor position during rotational dose delivery was verified for the first time using kV CBCT

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial meningioma (histopathologically proven in 13/16 cases) were treated with PRT between July 1997 and July 2002. Eight patients had skull base lesions. Thirteen patients received PRT after surgery either as adjuvant therapy for incomplete resection (eight patients) or for recurrence (five patients). Three patients received radical PRT after presumptive diagnosis based on imaging. The median prescribed dose was 56 CGE (range, 52.2-64, CGE=proton Gy X 1.1) at 1.8-2.0 CGE (median, 2.0) per fraction. Gross tumor volume and planning target volume ranged from 0.8 to 87.6 cc (median, 17.5) and 4.6-208.1 cc (median 107.7), respectively. Late ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic toxicity was assessed using the Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale (SOMA) of the Late Effects of Normal Tissue scoring system and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34.1 months (range, 6.5-67.8). RESULTS: Cumulative 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were 91.7, 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. No patient died from recurrent meningioma. One patient progressed locally after PRT. Radiographic follow-up (median, 34 months) revealed an objective response in three patients and stable disease in 12 patients. Cumulative 3-year toxicity free survival was 76.2%. One patient presented with radiation induced optic neuropathy (SOMA Grade 3) and retinopathy (SOMA Grade 2) 8.8 and 30.4 months after treatment, respectively. These patients with ophthalmologic toxicity received doses higher than those allowed for the optic/ocular structures. Another patient developed a symptomatic brain necrosis (CTCAE Grade 4) 7.2 months after treatment. No radiation-induced hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Spot-scanning PRT is an effective treatment for patient with untreated, recurrent or incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas. It offers highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped intracranial meningiomas, while delivering minimal non-target dose. Observed ophthalmologic toxicity is dose-related

The time of development of acute skin reactions varied in 2 patients with 30 metastatic skin nodules treated with doses varying from 1,175 to 1,951 peak pions and 2,350 to 3,901 rads of 100 kVp x rays. The reactions reached their peak approximately one week apart at all dose levels with both forms of radiation. No untoward effects have been seen in epidermis or subcutaneous tissues as late as 169 days after the start of treatment. All nodules disappeared and have not returned 169 days after treatment. There is a strong suggestion that the response of thick tumors is sensitive to the proportion of high LET radiation deposited at various levels in the tumor

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

Risk factors are multifocal; therefore, total dose calculation is crucial. We evaluated the contribution of scatter radiation to obtain an accurate cumulative spinal cord dose. Twenty patients undergoing three field head and neck radiation by Cobalt or 6 MV Linac had a total cord dose calculated from direct and scatter radiation. The cord was removed from the radiation field at tumor doses no higher than 4,400 cGy. Total tumor dose ranged from 5,400-7,400 cGy (mean 6060). All patients achieved the prescribed dose and none were lost to follow up (mean 36 months). It was found that scatter radiation can contribute as much as 20% extra dose to the spinal cord. Mean extra dose was 9% (range 1%-20%). This additional dose ranged from 52-810 cGy (mean 339 cGy). No apparent difference was seen with Cobalt or Linac source. Our conclusion was that significant additional dose is delivered to the spinal cord by scatter radiation and that scatter may contribute more to the development of myelopathy than previously believed

With few exceptions, previous studies have combined results for clival and sacral chordomas, or for chordomas and other similar tumours such as chondrosarcoma, and thus it is difficult to be specific about effects of therapy. This study included histological review using immunohistochemistry to confirm diagnosis. Analysis of the survival data for our patients suggests that there are two subgroups with distinct survival patterns: one group with high mortality within the first 5 years, and a second group with an indolent disease process and near normal life expectancy. The age of the patients at presentation ranged from 7 to 78 years, with a mean of 44.3 years. Male: female distribution was 6:5. The commonest presentation was with cranial nerve palsy (94%) or with headache (60%). The most frequently involved cranial nerve was the VIth (60%), followed by the IXth and Xth (40% each). Comparing our results with those of 50 years ago, there was little improvement in the outlook for these patients, despite improvements in surgical approaches and the use of radiotherapy. The promising results in skull base tumours using proton therapy must be treated with caution until definite criteria for diagnosis and outcome have been established. There is a case for a multicentre prospective study of this disease

There is no established treatment plan for the disease, which may be attributed to its rarity and aggressiveness. Surgery is the choice of treatment in early cases. Radiotherapy follows surgery, and chemotherapy has an insignificant role in its treatment. Radiation with heavy ion beams is showing promising results in cancer therapy. Compared to conventional radiation, it permits selective irradiation with minimal injury to the surrounding normal tissue, and treatment with a low dose within a short interval of time is possible. We herein report a case of PMME treated with heavy ion radiation, the first case to be reported so far, and review the relevant literature

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision

Fifteen patients with urinary malignant tumors were treated by proton irradiation during the period from June, 1985 to March, 1989 at Particle Radiation Medical Center, University of Tsukuba. Four patients were with renal cell carcinoma, five with prostatic cancer and six with bladder cancer. Treatment results were assessed by change in tumor size either three or six months after the irradiation. In all the four cases with renal cell carcinoma, the tumor sizes were found to be unchanged without any enlargement. Of the five cases with prostatic cancer, two showed that the treatment was effective and the tumor sizes in the other three cases were found to be unchanged. In three of the six cases with bladder cancer the tumors disappeared while the treatment was found effective in two other and it did not cause any enlargement of the tumor in the remaining one. Although local control of the tumor was successful in all the cases, one patient with prostatic cancer and three with bladder cancer died of cancer. Various side effects, such as radiation cystitis, were observed. This prospective therapy is expected to replace the conventional photon therapy. However, some improvement is needed to make full use of the advantageous properties in dose distribution. Combination therapy with other general therapy is required for some cases

This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy

Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis

Despite surgical exploration and an extensive diagnostic workup including radiological, nuclear medicine, and computer-assisted tomographic studies, many patients proved to have occult liver metastases manifested within 9 months post treatment. In addition, local and regional control of the primary neoplasm (approximately 20%) has been difficult to obtain even with doses of 6000 equivalent rad in 7 1/2 weeks. Gastric and biliary obstruction have required surgical bypass procedures since irradiation has not been successful in relieving obstructive symptoms. Evidence of gastrointestinal injury has been present in postradiation therapy in approximately 10% of patients, a figure which might be higher if more patients had a longer survival (average 10 months). Some patients require pancreatic enzyme supplementation because of pancreatic deficiency either secondary to tumor or treatment. Further improvement in local control and survival requires better diagnostic methods for evaluation of local and metastatic spread, improved therapy for local and regional disease, as well as therapy directed at occult liver metastases that are frequently present

The results, prognostic factors and live-tables will be demonstrated. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1984 and 1995 48 patients were treated at the Department of Radiooncology at the University of Munster because of epidural metastases. All but 3 cases were histologically proved. Three patients were irradiated without definitive histology because of clinical symptoms and CT or MR-imaging. Only patients with solid tumors were considered-patients with systemic diseases like leukemia or lymphoma were not analysed. In all of our cases irradiation was combined with systemic steroid application. Radiotherapy was performed with cobalt-60 or with an accelerator with total doses between 25 Gy and 40 Gy. RESULTS: The combination of irradiation and steroids had resulted in pain relief in about 80% of all patients. The ambulatory status after paraparesis was restituted in 35%. Best prognosis had been seen in patients with the following criterions: primary tumor should be breast cancer, no evidence of other tumor manifestation, no signs of paraparesis or paraplegia before the beginning of irradiation or regaining the ambulatory status after therapy. Under these conditions we have calculated a median survival rate of 709 days for these patients with good prognosis. Patients with bronchogenic carcinoma had a very poor prognosis with a median survival rate of only 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural metastases in cancer led often to a very fatal outcome. Irradiation is useful for pain relief and also for local tumor control. In some cases in patients with good prognostic factors long-time survival could be demonstrated. The results of irradiation are comparable with those after surgery

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79% and 60%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted

In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. Histopathology confirmed in 1 eye enucleated 5 months after treatment that medium-low internal reflectivity coresponded with several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. The results of our study indicate the reliability of standardized A and B scan echography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation therapy	
1	1562	An optimization algorithm that incorporates IMRT delivery constraints	Algorithms, Head, Humans, Male, Models,Statistical, Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Physics, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum, Research, Risk	An intensity-modulated beam optimization algorithm is presented which incorporates the delivery constraints into the optimization cycle. The optimization algorithm is based on the quasi-Newton method of iteratively solving minimization problems. The developed algorithm iteratively corrects the incident, pencil-beam-like, fluence to incorporate the delivery constraints. In the present study, the goal of the optimization algorithm is to achieve the best deliverable radiotherapy plan, subject to the constraints of the delivery technique described by a leaf-sequencing algorithm being applied concurrently. In general, if they are applied after, rather than during, the optimization cycle, the delivery constraints associated with the IMRT technique can produce local variations up to 6% in the 'optimized' dose (i.e., distribution without applied constraints) and reduce the degree of conformity, of the dose, to the PTV region. The optimization method has been applied to three IMRT delivery techniques: dynamic multileaf (DMLC), multiple-static-field (MSF) and slice-by-slice tomotherapy (NOMOS MIMiC). The beam profiles were generated for a prostate tumour with organs at risk being the rectum, bladder and femoral heads. The optimization method described was shown to generate optimum and deliverable IMRT plans for these three delivery techniques. In the case of the DMLC and MSF the optimization converged within 3-5 iterations to a mean PTV dose of 69.60 +/- 1.34 Gy and 69.71 +/- 1.34 Gy, respectively, while for NOMOS MIMiC approximately 10 iterations were needed to obtain 69.68 +/- 1.55 Gy. In addition to this, the IMRT optimization also yielded optimum fluence profiles when clustering was performed concurrently with the leaf-sequencer. An optimum between 8 and 15 clusters of equal fluence 'intensity' was shown to establish the best compromise between the number of fluence levels and the PTV dose coverage	
0	233	Rectal dose-volume differences using proton radiotherapy and a rectal balloon or water alone for the treatment of prostate cancer	Balloon Dilatation/is [Instrumentation], Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/is [Instrumentation], Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods], Male, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rectum/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Seminal Vesicles/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Seminal Vesicles/re [Radiation Effects], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Water	PURPOSE: To describe dose-volume values with the use of water alone vs. a rectal balloon (RB) for the treatment of prostate cancer with proton therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7%; V50, 17.3%; and V70, 10.2%; RW V10, 32.4%; V50, 20.4%; and V70, 14.6%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2% +/- 2.3% compared with 2.4% +/- 1.3% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1% was seen with an RB in 46% for the rectum V70 and in 40% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients

METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe, brain stem, thalamus, or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment. The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient. Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high. Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution. One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin. The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a helium-ion particle beam. The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents. The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous malformations. RESULTS: One irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult. This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of helium-ion radiosurgery. Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately. Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations, six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels, fibrinoid necrosis, and ferrugination. However, the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls. All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels; none were completely thrombosed. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years (mean 3.5 yr) after radiation delivery. It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients. However, recurrent bleeding from AOVMs may relate to poor radiation response in some patients	
0	136	Comparative treatment planning between proton and x-ray therapy in esophageal cancer	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage x-rays and protons for five patients with esophageal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of x-rays. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 188 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas (<15 mm in diameter and <5 mm in height) near the optic disc or macula (within 4 disc diameters of either structure). METHODS: Patients were treated with proton beam therapy at doses of either 50 CGE or 70 CGE between October 1989 and July 1994, and followed up biannually through April 1998. Outcomes included visual acuity, radiation complications, melanoma recurrence, and metastasis. RESULTS: Proportions of patients retaining visual acuity of at least 20/200 were similar in the 2 dose groups at 5 years after radiation (approximately 55%). Similar numbers of patients in each group experienced tumor regrowth (2 patients at 50 CGE vs 3 patients at 70 CGE; P>.99) and metastasis (7 patients at 50 CGE vs 8 patients at 70 CGE;P=.79). Five-year rates of radiation maculopathy also were similar (for both groups, approximately 75% for tumors within 1 disc diameter and 40% for tumors >1 disc diameter from the macula). Rates of radiation papillopathy were nonsignificantly decreased in the 50-CGE treatment group when tumors were located 1 disc diameter or less from the optic disc (P=.20). Patients treated with the lower dose also experienced significantly less visual field loss. CONCLUSIONS: This level of dose reduction did not result in a lesser degree of visual acuity loss. The lower-dose group did experience significantly less visual field loss. Local tumor recurrence and metastatic death rates were similar in both dose groups. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:773-778

Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated

Twenty-three eyes have been enucleated because of complications and five eyes have been obtained at autopsy. We have evaluated 27 of these eyes. Neovascular glaucoma (10 eyes), painful keratitis (6 eyes), continued tumor growth (4 eyes), and vitreous hemorrhage (2 eyes) were the major complications of treatment that led to enucleation. The degree of tumor necrosis correlated with the size, pigmentation, and anterior extent of the tumor. It did not correlate with the interval from irradiation or with the amount of tumor shrinkage. Mitotic figures were extremely rare in treated tumors, suggesting that the tumor cells have lost their ability to cycle	
0	157	What is the role of radiation in the treatment of subfoveal membranes: review of radiobiologic, pathologic, and other considerations to initiate a multimodality discussion. [Review] [104 refs]	Aged, Animals, Cerebrovascular Circulation/re [Radiation Effects], Choroid/bs [Blood Supply], Humans, Macular Degeneration/rt [Radiotherapy], Microcirculation/de [Drug Effects], Neovascularization,Pathologic/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Rats, Research, Retina/re [Radiation Effects], Retinal Neovascularization/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	BACKGROUND: Single-dose-fraction conformal proton beam and multiple-fraction X ray dose schedules have been used to treat subfoveal neovascular membranes. All schedules successfully controlled membrane progression, stabilized vision in most patients, and increased visual acuity in some. Conformal protons also decreased the radiation dose to healthy tissues outside the designated volume (16 mm in diameter). It appears that radiation therapy could be useful and cost-effective, but neither the optimal time-dose schedule single or multiple dose fractions nor the type of radiation proton conformal beam or x-ray therapy are defined. METHODS: By means of an extensive literature survey, we reviewed the rationale for using radiation to treat subfoveal neovascularization, examined a paradigm of radiation interaction with tissue, reviewed the histopathology of neovascular membranes, and documented the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of the disease. Accepting that the eye is an extracranial brain extension, and that its microvasculature has properties similar to brain microvessels, we reviewed the radiobiologic response of brain microvessels. We also revisited the controversy concerning the efficacy of single-dose-fraction vs. multifraction schedules. RESULTS: This paper outlines parameters within which radiation therapy's role might be defined, and proposes a clinical radiation-biology scoring program to evaluate radiation effects, based on the SOMA concept. CONCLUSION: A prospective, controlled clinical trial is feasible and is indicated to determine radiation therapy's role in managing the proliferative component of age-related macular degeneration.

1	445	Evaluation of surface and superficial dose for head and neck treatments using conventional or intensity-modulated techniques	Antineoplastic Protocols, Calibration, Fluorides/ch [Chemistry], Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Lithium Compounds/ch [Chemistry], Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation Injuries, Radiation Protection, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/mt [Methods]	With increased use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck treatment questions have arisen as to selection of an optimum treatment approach when either superficial sparing or treatment is desired. Other work has pointed out the increased superficial dose resulting from obliquity effects when multiple tangential beams are applied to head and neck treatment, as is the general case in IMRT planning. Helical tomotherapy might be expected to result in even further enhanced superficial dose compared with conventional bilateral field treatment. We have designed a typical right oropharynx target volume in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Three different treatment techniques have been used to optimally treat this target, including bilateral static fields, eight-field IMRT and helical tomotherapy. The phantom was immobilized in a standard treatment position and treated on a Varian 2300cd linear accelerator and on a Hi-Art Helical Tomotherapy unit. 1 mm3 lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed on the surface of the phantom at a number of axial test positions. Film strips (Kodak EDR2) were either wrapped around the surface or sandwiched within the phantom. Measured doses at the surface and as a function of depth are compared with the planning system predictions for each treatment technique. The maximum surface doses on the proximal treatment side, averaged from TLDs and films, were measured to be 69-82% of the target dose with the bilateral fields yielding the lowest surface doses (69%), tomotherapy about 2% more than that (71%) and IMRT 13% more (82%). Anterior to the target volume, doses are always low for bilateral treatment. In this case the minimum anterior surface dose (chin area) was 6% of the prescription dose from that technique as compared with 26% and 35% from the IMRT and tomotherapy methods, respectively. The Eclipse and Tomotherapy planning systems both modelled deep and superficial doses well. Surface doses were better modelled by Eclipse at the test points, while the tomotherapy plans consistently overestimated the measured doses by 10% or more. Depth dose measurements, extracted from embedded films, indicated the depth of dose build-up to >99% to be the shallowest for IMRT (2-5 mm) followed by tomotherapy (5-8 mm) and bilateral fields (10-15 mm). The amount of surface dose is clearly technique dependent and should be taken into account in the planning stage

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

We have treated 54 patients with ciliary body melanoma using helium ions from 1978 to 1985. Because of the high rate of metastatic disease, the 5-year disease specific survival rate is only 59% despite a 5-year local control rate of 98%. The greatest diameter of the tumor was predictive of loss of vision and enucleation (p = .05, p = .04, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the greatest diameter of the tumor was the most important predictor of death from metastases. The incidence of neovascular glaucoma at 5 years is 43%. The 5-year actuarial rate of enucleation is 26%. Enucleation was done for pain and/or neovascular glaucoma. Univariate analysis showed treatment volume to be a statistically significant predictor for the development of neovascular glaucoma (p = .0017) and enucleation (p = .0078). Seventy percent of neovascular glaucoma occurred in patients with treatment volume greater than 5.5 cc. Seventy-four percent occurred in patients with an initial ultrasound height greater than 9.2 mm. Using this information, patients at high risk for neovascular glaucoma could be considered for prophylactic treatment with panretinal photocoagulation

Between December 1993 and August 2002, 100 patients (median age: 53 years [8 - 85], M/F sex ratio: 3/2) were treated by a combination of high-energy photons and protons. The proton component was delivered at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) by a 201 MeV beam. The median total dose delivered to the tumor volume was 67 GyECo. With a median follow-up of 31 months [range: 0 - 87], 25 tumours relapsed locally. The 2- and 4-year local control rates were 86.3% (+/-3.9%) and 53.8% (+/-7.5%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, at least 95% of the tumor volume encompassed by the 95% isodose (p = 0.048; RR: 3.4 95%CI [1.01 - 11.8]) and a minimal dose delivered into the tumor volume <56 GyECo (p = 0.042; RR: 2.3 95%CI [1.03 - 5.2]) were independent prognostic factors of local control. Ten patients died. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.3% (+/-2.5%) and 80.5% (+/-7.2%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, local tumor control (p = 0.005; RR: 21 95%CI [2.2 - 200]) was a prognostic factor of overall survival. For chordomas of the base of the skull and upper cervical spine treated by surgery and irradiation combining photons and protons, the quality of irradiation, reflected by homogeneity of the dose into the tumor volume, is a major factor of local control. Close attention must be paid to minimize the underdosed areas close to critical organs. The role of surgical resection remains paramount, and a trial of dose escalation would have to consider an increase in the dose to critical organs, especially as current results indicate the low toxicity of this treatment

We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC	
0	885	Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children	California, Cerebellar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child,Preschool, Cobalt, Cranial Irradiation/mt [Methods], Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Count, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Pilot Projects, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Spinal Cord/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, X-Rays	PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2 or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields, with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen. Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate irradiation

A progressive reduction in glandular volume (of low, medium, and high grade) was observed in 48/50 patients respectively within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and 6-9 months after treatment. After 9 months only lesser modifications were observed. A statistically significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between volume decrease percentage and histologic grading of the tumor, but not with its stage. Within the groups of patients affected with similar-grade neoplasms, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) was observed, relative to the decrease rate of prostatic volume, between the patients with complete response and those with partial or no response. US monitoring of prostatic volume after radiotherapy, if correlated with histologic grading, can yield early predictive elements as to treatment outcome, thus contributing to select non-responsive patients to submit to biopsy and, if necessary, to therapeutic alternatives or combinations. Longer-term studies are needed to prove its effectiveness, to prognostic purposes, in the single patient	
1	2836	[Radiation pneumonitis in the x-ray picture following megavoltage irradiation using the Neptune 10 p. linear accelerator]. [German]	Aged, Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Fibrosis, Humans, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Pneumonia/et [Etiology], Radiation, Radiation Effects, Radiation Pneumonitis, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Testicular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	For 105 patients with healthy lungs (76 breast carcinomas, 29 testicular tumors) irradiated from 1981 to 1983 with the linear accelerator Neptune 10p. the pulmonary effects of irradiation were monitored over several years. The true dose applied for breast carcinomas was 46 Gy (2 Gy per fraction), for testicular tumors 40 Gy were applied in the mediastinal field. 9% of the patients showed excessive infiltrations, 18% radiation pneumonitis of medium degree. In 35% of the patients slight infiltrations were found. The course of the pneumonitis was, according to its stage, regular. After a latency period 30 days post irradiation the early stadium occurs. Florid pneumonitis develops between the 45th and 90th day after irradiation. Extended radiographic effects occur up to 10 days earlier. Through a period of pneumonitis with pronounced shrinkage fibrosis develops. By CT-based individual radiation planning the pulmonary radiation reaction can be significantly reduced. The differential diagnostics of radiation effects and metastases is discussed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were treated with proton beam radiation between September 1991 and December 1992. They had an initial examination including visual acuity, funduscopy, A and B scan ultrasonography of the eye, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. General examination included chest radiography and B scan ultrasonography of the liver. All tumors received a total dose of 60 cobalt-Gray equivalents (applied in four daily fractions) at the Orsay proton therapy center. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were treated with a median follow-up of 116 months. Their median age was 59 years. Thirteen tumors were anterior to the equator, 76 overlapped the equator and 78 were posterior to the equator. An initial retinal detachment was present in 41 cases. The optic disk was invaded in 10 cases. The median tumor diameter was 12 mm and the median tumor thickness was 5.8 mm. The mean initial acuity was 20/50. The survival rate was 62.93% at 10 years; 72.9% of deaths resulted from metastasis. Statistically significant risk factors for death identified in the multivariate analysis were tumor diameter greater than 12 mm (p=0.0004) and age over 60 years (p=0.0001). The metastasis rate at 10 years was 31%. The liver was affected in 97.8% of these patients. Risk factors for metastasis were the anterior site of the tumor, its volume greater than 0.4 cc and the presence of retinal detachment at diagnosis. The secondary enucleation rate at 10 years was 13.23%, mainly attributable to secondary neovascular glaucoma. The local recurrence rate was 6%. The visual acuity rate in 42.1% of patients was better than 20/100 at 10 years. Visual loss was mainly due to postradiation maculopathy and neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the long-term results found in the literature on proton beam radiation. This therapy allows good tumor control, an excellent eye retention rate, and good final visual acuity for approximately half of the patients

CT consisted of two cycles of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2, by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days and cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on day 4 with mannitol-induced diuresis at 4-week intervals. Postoperatively, RT was administered when resection margins were minimal or if paraesophageal nodes were abnormal; the RT consisted of 5,000 to 5,400 cGy to the tumor area plus a 800- to 1,200-cGy boost to known abnormal tumor margins. Nineteen of 24 patients were resectable (79%). There was one SR death (5%). One of 22 had a normal barium swallow post-CT, no visible tumor at SR, and no pathologic evidence of any residual disease. There was complete radiologic and gross clinical disappearance of tumor post-CT or post-SR in ten of 22 patients (45%). Four of 22 (18%) had greater than or equal to 50% regression, and five of 22 (23%) had no response. Toxicity of CT was mild. Eight of 19 patients (42%) received RT, and six of 19 (32%) received CT postoperatively. Sixteen of 24 (67%) are alive with a median duration of observation of 9.5 months. Eight of 24 (33%) are dead, five of whom had not responded to preoperative CT. Ten of 14 responders are alive and disease free. The mean survival time for nonresponders was 6.70 months and for responders, 20.40 months, with the longest survivor disease free at 45 months

Percutaneous high-voltage therapy with cobalt 60 was given to 51 patients and 35 patients were exposed to ultra-hard X-rays from al 17 MeV betatron. Taking into account tumour staging and grading, there was no difference between the two groups as far as prevention of tumour recurrence is concerned. Tumour recurrences occurred in 63-65 percent of the cases. Following betatron irradiation, there was an average five-year survival rate of 54 percent, following telecobalt irradiation, the figure was 41 percent	
0	1560	Critical appraisal of treatment techniques based on conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams and proton beams for therapy of intact breast	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/ah [Anatomy & Histology], Carcinoma,Ductal,Breast/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Lung, Lung Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control], Physics, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique. RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results

The distribution was determined for four nuclides: 232Th and its decay products, 228Ra and 228Th; and 230Th, a contaminant associated with Thorotrast. More than 90% of the activity was associated with the reticuloendothelial system. Approximately 32% of the total activity was found in the total skeleton (mineral bone and bone marrow), which is somewhat higher than expected from the literature. The 44% found in the liver and 12% in the spleen were somewhat lower than expected. This difference may be attributable, in part, to the initial deposition as influenced by colloidal particle size and to the radiation-induced hyposplenism, splenic atrophy, and slight hepatic atrophy observed at autopsy. In addition, roughly 3% of the activity was found in the Thorotrastoma and surrounding carotid artery tissue. Estimated lifetime absorbed doses from the 232Th series were 15 Gy to the liver, 121 Gy to the spleen, 4 Gy to the skeleton, and 16 Gy to the Thorotrastoma. Comparable dose equivalents to these tissues are 300, 2420, 80, and 320 Sv, respectively, assuming a quality factor of 20 for alpha irradiation	
0	4690	Comparison of radiosurgery planning modalities for acoustic neuroma with regard to conformity and mean target dose	Algorithms, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Hand, Humans, Lead, Light, Methods, Neuroma,Acoustic/pp [Physiopathology], Neuroma,Acoustic/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators/is [Instrumentation], Patients, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Software	PURPOSE: To evaluate dose conformity and mean target dose in light of previous comparative studies and state-of-the-art radiosurgery delivery modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with acoustic neuromas deemed clinically suitable for linear accelerator or Gamma Knife radiosurgery were planned such that the minimum doses for any plan were equal. Gamma Knife plans were prepared in three ways: by altering the prescription of previously published data, by hand and with the assistance of an automatic planning algorithm (wizard). The linear accelerator plans were prepared utilizing a micro-multileaf collimator in both static and dynamic modes. The dose volume histogram analyses lead to a measure of conformity and the mean and minimum target dose for each plan. Statistical significance was calculated as each planning modality was compared with every other. RESULTS: All Gamma Knife plans demonstrated a statistically significantly better conformity when compared with fixed field linear accelerator techniques. When compared to linear accelerator techniques the wizard-assisted Gamma Knife plans demonstrated significantly better conformity. The mean target dose for all the Gamma Knife plans was significantly higher than that of the linear accelerator plans (19.2 Gy vs. 13.4 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: Conformity of the prescription isodose to the target shape is of major importance in radiosurgery. The modalities compared represent commercially available and widely accepted systems. Gamma Knife plans derived using the 'wizard' option and finalized by hand yield the best conformity. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel

[Japanese]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Esophageal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophagus, Esophagus/ra [Radiography], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Risk Factors, Skin, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities, X-Ray Film	Since 1983 a clinical trial of proton beam radiotherapy has been conducted at the Proton Medical Research Center (PMRC) of the University of Tsukuba. We have made it a rule to do field localization by X-ray pictures before each treatment. For this purpose we have developed a localize-verify system consisting of a fluoroscopic unit and a real time digital image processing device. By using this system as well as X-ray films, field placement errors or corrected distance at field localization were measured in 11 patients with esophageal cancers. Measurements of corrected distances on a total of 177 localization attempts disclosed that correction by > 5 mm was necessary in 30.6% and by > 10 mm in 10.2% of all localization attempts. Corrected distances appeared to increase with age, possibly because the skin becomes looser and ambulatory status tends to be more limited in older patients. Field placement corrections of more than 5 mm were required in 66.7% of 60 localizations in patients > 80 years old. Two patients in whom the anatomical positions of the esophagus were easily movable are presented. The following common characteristics of these patients were considered high risk factors: they were more than 80 years old; lesions were located in the lower esophagus; and they had T1 tumors. These findings suggested that frequent positioning and verification of treatment fields are necessary in the accurate treatment of esophageal cancers, especially those in high-risk patients

Short-term effects at 2 months following treatment were studied in a further three patients. MRI abnormalities were observed in nine patients. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls (n = 17) were seen in any of the calculated 1H-MRS metabolite ratios, in any of the three patient groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis there was a correlation between the choline/water ratio and a low IQ. It is concluded that any systematic radiation-induced changes in the 1H MRS metabolites must be below the detection threshold of this study

The treatment volumes for 13 NSCLC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy were planned using the five different techniques and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used extensively in the comparative analysis. The minimum dose to the phase 2 target volume was escalated to 90 Gy, or until the point at which pre-set tolerance limits of spinal cord or lung were exceeded. The proton plan could treat nine of the 13 patients up to a dose of 90 Gy. Among the four X-ray techniques, performance varied enormously. One of them could not treat any of the patients, even to the conventional 60 Gy level, without failing to meet one or more of the criteria, whilst another one could treat 10 out of the 13 patients, although with this technique only four were permitted to have the dose escalated to 90 Gy. It was also found that two of the 13 patients could not be treated by any of the proton or X-ray plans to the conventional level, and were therefore considered unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. Various issues in conformal NSCLC radiotherapy including organ movement, tumour control, other possible organs at risk etc., are also discussed

An additional 30 tumors in the total patient population were treated with 100 kVp x-rays to assess comparative effects on skin nodules and 8 patients received additive photon or electron radiation to pion-treated portals. Of 52 evaluable tumors in 20 patients treated with pions only and followed for 3 to 22 months, 81% (42 tumors) completely regressed; 6% (3 tumors) partially regressed; and 13% (7 tumors) did not respond, although 5 of the 7 have shown no growth for 10 months. Of eight tumors in seven patients treated with a combination of pions and conventional radiation, three tumors showed complete response and five tumors showed partial response, though the resected specimens in two (one with complete and one with partial response) revealed no tumor microscopically. Reactions in normal tissues have been mild, with some patients exhibiting no normal tissue reaction, as compared with relatively marked tumor response	
0	1443	[Quality control of intensity modulated treatments in radiotherapy]. [French]	France, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Prostate, Quality Control, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage/st [Standards], Radiotherapy/st [Standards], Time	Since January 2001, radiotherapy treatments with modulated intensity beams (IMRT) have started at the Centre Oscar-Lambret. This paper presents the tests and measurements made before the clinical implementation as well the quality control performed before each routine treatment. We use the treatment planning system Helax-TMS (MDS-Nordion) and the Primus accelerator (Siemens) linked to the Lantis network with Primeview and Simtec modules (Siemens) allowing to deliver intensity modulated beams with Step-and-Shoot technique. A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a "classical" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique. The next step is the real time dosimetry with a portal imager	
1	3871	Estimates of radiogenic cancer risks	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Air, Alpha Particles, Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Incidence, Infant,Newborn, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Mortality, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Radiation, Relative Biological Effectiveness, Risk, Skin, Time, Washington	A methodology recently developed by the U.S. EPA for estimating the carcinogenic risks from ionizing radiation is described. For most cancer sites, the risk model is one in which age-specific, relative risk coefficients are obtained by taking a geometric mean of the coefficients derived from the atomic bomb survivor data using two different methods for transporting risks from the Japanese to the U.S. population. The risk models are applied to estimate organ-specific risks per unit dose for a stationary population with mortality rates governed by 1980 U.S. vital statistics. With the exception of breast cancer, low-LET radiogenic cancer risk estimates are reduced by a factor of 2 at low doses and dose rates compared to acute high dose exposure conditions. For low dose (or dose rate) conditions, the risk of inducing a premature cancer death from uniform, whole body, low-LET irradiation is calculated to be 5.1 x 10(-2) Gy-1. Neglecting nonfatal skin cancers, the corresponding incidence risk is 7.6 x 10(-2) Gy-1. High-LET (alpha particle) risks are presumed to increase linearly with dose and to be independent of dose rate. High-LET risks are estimated to be 20 times the low-LET risks estimated under low dose rate conditions, except for leukemia and breast cancer where RBEs of 1 and 10 are adopted, respectively

METHODS: Retrospective review of 78 patients with 60 medium and 18 large-size choroidal melanomas at a median follow-up of 34 months. RESULTS: The 5-year data for local control, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were estimated to be 90.5 +/- 3.7%, 76.2 +/- 6.7%, and 75.6 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Eye preservation was achieved in 75.3% of patients, with useful (better than 20/200) visual acuity (VA) in 49.1% of surviving patients. Both local failure and complications led to enucleation. Prognosticators were tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.003), large tumors involving the ciliary body (p = 0.041), and local failure (p < 0.001). Prognostic factors for VA following PRT were initial VA (p = 0.001), doses to optic disc (p = 0.001) and fovea (p = 0.022) higher than 35 CGE (Cobalt Gray equivalent), tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.034), and retinal detachment (p < 0.001). Tumor basis diameter was significantly related to metastases free survival (p = 0.02), overall survival (p = 0.033), and disease specific survival (p = 0.017), but did not impair local tumor control, rate of enucleation, and VA. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that PRT is an effective and safe treatment for medium and large size choroidal melanoma. PRT can preserve the eye and its function in a reasonable percentage of patients. Further evaluation in controlled clinical trials comparing PRT to plaque radiotherapy and enucleation is required	
1	2363	The effectiveness of immobilization during prostate irradiation	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Immobilization, Male, Methods, Particle Accelerators, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/is [Instrumentation], Rectum, Research, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a hemibody foam cradle on the reproducibility of patient setup during external beam radiation treatment of prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1992 and April 1993, 74 patients received external beam radiation treatment to the prostate +/- nodes, generally with a four-field box technique. Forty-four of the 74 patients had a custom-made hemibody foam cast used in an attempt to improve setup accuracy. A review of the routine weekly port films was performed following the completion of therapy to determine the reproducibility of patient setup in all 74 patients. The physician's request of an isocenter shift was used as an indicator of reproducibility. Neither the treating technologists nor the physicians knew at the time the films were taken that the port films would be reviewed for setup reproducibility at a later date. The results were compared between the patients treated with (44) and without (30) an immobilization device. RESULTS: In the 44 immobilized patients, 213 routine checks of the isocenter were performed during the 7-week course of radiation therapy. In 17.4% of these instances (37 out of 213), an isocenter shift was requested. This rate is compared to 23.1% (30 out of 130) in the 30 patients who did not have the immobilization device (p < 0.2). There was a statistically significant reduction in isocenter shifts requested in the anterior to posterior direction in the patients who were immobilized, 5.1% (9 out of 175) vs. 12.6% (13 out of 103) (p < 0.05, two tailed chi-square test). There was no significant improvement in the reproducibility of isocenter placement in the cephalad to caudal or right to left directions. CONCLUSIONS: This custom-made hemibody foam cradle appears to improve the reproducibility of patient setup during the 7-week course of fractionated external beam irradiation for patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This type of immobilization device is now routinely used in our clinic and is recommended for all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. These devices are likely to be particularly useful when contemplating dose escalation to minimize the volume of bladder and rectum included in the treatment fields

This represents the largest group evaluated histologically in the literature and is the first report evaluating effects of particle radiation in pancreatic tissue. Patient survival after therapy averaged 9 months. Most died of infection and/or pulmonary emboli. Local control was achieved in 27%. The pancreatic tumors had histologically more severe radiation changes than nontumor bearing pancreas. Irradiated bone marrow was severely hypocellular, and irradiated skin was atrophic. Five patients had radiation injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal cord, liver, and kidneys showed no damage. This study demonstrates the safety of helium particle irradiation with present therapeutic planning. Injury to tumor was seen without excessive damage to adjacent tissues	
1	872	Radiobiological rationale and patient selection for high-LET radiation in cancer therapy	Dose Fractionation, Fast Neutrons, Fast Neutrons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Linear Energy Transfer, Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Patient Selection, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Research, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The rationale for introducing ion beams in cancer therapy is the high level of physical selectivity that can be achieved with ions, equal or even better than with proton beams or modern photon techniques, as well as the potential advantage of high-LET radiations for some tumour types and sites. The radiobiological arguments for high-LET radiation in cancer therapy are reviewed: reduction of OER in the case of hypoxic and poorly-reoxygenating tumours, and the lesser importance of repair phenomena which are a problem in controlling repair-proficient photon-resistant tumours. Fast neutrons were the first type of high-LET radiation used clinically, and were often applied under suboptimal technical conditions. Nevertheless, useful clinical information was derived from the neutron experience. A greater benefit from neutrons than from conventional radiotherapy was found for several tumour sites. The present discussion is limited to the results for salivary gland tumours and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Based on the fast neutron experience, radiobiological arguments, and the added benefit of excellent physical selectivity of ion beams, the potential clinical indications for high-LET ions are discussed: hypoxic, slowly growing and well-differentiated photon-resistant tumours. One of the main remaining issues is the selection of individual patients for high- or low-LET radiation. Since the physical selectivity of ions now matches that obtained with other techniques, the selection of patients will be based only on the radiobiological characteristics of the tumour	
0	1900	Proton radiation therapy (PRT) for pediatric optic pathway gliomas: comparison with 3D planned conventional photons and a standard photon technique	Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glioma/pa [Pathology], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Optic Chiasm, Optic Nerve, Optic Nerve Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Optic Nerve Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Software, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%, and 25% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (<20 cm3) and larger (> 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47% and 77% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11% and 16%) and pituitary gland (13% and 16%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39% and 54%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT. CONCLUSION: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues

The German Group of Pediatric Radiation Oncology (APRO) has generated a concept for a prospective evaluation of radiation-associated late effects in childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a nationwide central database for the documentation of radiation parameters and side effects of all children treated within therapy protocols of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A study center has been implemented in Muenster, the documentation has started in July 2001 in few centers in a pilot phase. Since February 2004 the documentation is done countrywide. Detailed documentation forms have been designed for treatment parameters and for doses applied at organs at risk. Furthermore, a uniform toxicity documentation, according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria, was chosen. Patients were reported from the study centers of the GPOH to the study center. All information was collected and analyzed in the study center. RESULTS: Till July 31, 2005, 438 documentations of radiation and 579 toxicity documentations of side effects have been collected in the study center. 46 centers for radiotherapy in Germany and one center each in Austria and in Switzerland took part in the documentation. The quality of documentation regarding completeness and plausibility fulfilled the expected criteria in most cases. This feasibility analysis showed that important information about organ dose levels and side effects was documented in a large number of patients (Figures 1 and 2). CONCLUSION: This prospective evaluation of radiotherapy and radiogenic side effects in children and adolescents will allow correlating doses at organs at risk and the incidence of acute and late sequelae in Germany. Further documentations and a longer follow-up are necessary to obtain powerful results	
0	290	Deep propofol sedation for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in children undergoing proton radiation therapy of cranial tumors	Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Conscious Sedation, Female, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives, Immobilization/mt [Methods], Infant, Male, Movement/de [Drug Effects], Nasal Decongestants/tu [Therapeutic Use], Propofol, Protons, Respiratory Tract Infections/co [Complications], Respiratory Tract Infections/dt [Drug Therapy], Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	BACKGROUND: Vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization of the head is a reliable technique for reproducible precise head positioning as used for proton radiation in adults. We report preliminary experience using deep propofol sedation without an artificial airway in children undergoing proton radiation of cranial tumors requiring vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization. METHODS: Sedation was started with a bolus of i.v. midazolam followed by repeated small boluses of propofol as required to tolerate bite-block insertion and patient positioning. Sedation was maintained by continuous propofol infusion until removal of the bite block. Oxygen was administered by a nasal cannula. SpO2, endtidal CO2 taken at the nose and respiratory adverse events such as coughing, bucking, airway obstruction, regurgitation or aspiration were recorded. Data are mean+/-sd. RESULTS: Ten children aged 2.6+/-0.8 years were treated to date. For each child, cumulative 26.7+/-1.9 radiation fractions were administered. Propofol dose administered for induction, bite-block insertion and patient positioning was 3.9+/-0.5 mg.kg(-1). Time from insertion to removal of the bite block lasted 48.3+/-6.2 min. Endtidal CO2 values were 5.6+/-0.8 kPa (43+/-7 mmHg) and SpO2 values were 98.3+/-1.9% with spontaneous breathing, supplemental oxygen and bite block inserted. No respiratory adverse events occurred during the 267 sedation procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Deep propofol sedation without the use of an artificial airway is an interesting technique for vacuum-assisted bite-block immobilization in young children undergoing precise radiation therapy of cranial tumors. However, simultaneous individual anesthetic challenges require pediatric anesthesiologists highly experienced with the pediatric airway, clinical alertness and closed monitoring	
0	1454	Potential reduction of the incidence of radiation-induced second cancers by using proton beams in the treatment of pediatric tumors	Adolescent, Child, Humans, Incidence, Male, Medulloblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/pc [Prevention & Control], Neoplasms,Second Primary/pc [Prevention & Control], Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Risk, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Switzerland, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To assess the potential influence of improved dose distribution with proton beams compared to conventional or intensity-modulated (IM) X-ray beams on the incidence of treatment-induced secondary cancers in pediatric oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology

A limited institutional pilot study was therefore done by the Southwest Oncology Group between October 1977, and November 1978 to test the benefit of this program in previously untreated persons with Stages 3 and 4 diffuse histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eleven evaluable patients with the following histologies were treated: 7 poorly differentiated, 2 with histiocytic, 1 with mixed lymphoma and 1 with well-differentiated morphology. CHOP was given in the following manner: cyclophosphamide 400 mg/M2 IV day 1, adriamycin 40 mg/M2 IV day 1, vincristine 2 mg IV day 1, and Prednisone 100 mg po daily X 5. Forty-five rad total body irradiation was delivered in three fractions on days 21, 23 and 25. Chemotherapy was repeated on day 42, etc., until four cycles of CHOP and three cycles TBI (135R) were delivered. Responses were seen in 8/11 patients (6 CR and 2 PR); 5 persons are currently alive and 6 are dead. Two of the living patients are alive with disease and the remainder are in unmaintained remission. Two persons died with no response and one died in complete remission of an unrelated illness. The median duration of remission is 15 months and the median survival for all patients is 48 months. The therapy was well tolerated with a mean nadir leukocyte count of 3,020 X 10(9)/microliters (range 1.2-5.5) and a mean nadir platelet count of 188 X 10(9)/microliters (range 016-270). As delivered, this program is capable of producing durable remissions and needs to be verified in a larger series of patients

Ten patients were irradiated after a radical thymectomy, three after partial resection and eleven after histologic diagnosis alone The patients were treated by different irradiation methods, mostly with the photons of a Co60 unit and a 43 MeV betatron. The average focal dose was 45 Gy which were administered within five weeks. The observation period was five years on an average. The general five year survival probability was 54%; some partial collectives were evaluated individually. These studies show that by unique radiotherapy, too, a two-year survival rate of 100% and a five-year survival rate of 50% as sell as a local recurrence rate of about 20% can be reached. Patients under fourty years with epithelial thymomas and a dose of less than 40 Gy have a less favorable prognosis. Compared to other authors, a relatively high rate of remote metastases was observed which necessitated extensive follow-up measures and suggests an adjuvant chemotherapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 86%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95% and 79% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients aged > or =80 years with HCC underwent proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 80 to 85 years (median, 81 years). Hepatic tumors were solitary in 17 patients and multiple in 4. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 135 mm (median, 40 mm) in maximum diameter. Ten, 5, and 6 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 60 Gy in 10 fractions, 66 Gy in 22 fractions, and 70 Gy in 35 fractions, respectively, according to tumor location. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period of 6-49 months (median, 16 months). Five patients showed new hepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume, 2-13 months after treatment, and 1 of them also had lung metastasis. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 100% and 72% at 3 years, respectively. Of 21 patients, 7 died 6-49 months after treatment; 2 patients each died of trauma and old age, and 1 patient each died of HCC, pneumonia, and arrhythmia. The 3-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 62%, 88%, and 51%, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or = 3 but thrombocytopenia in 2 patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy seems to be tolerable, effective, and safe for aged patients with HCC. It may contribute to prolonged survival due to tumor control

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2). Grade 3 late toxicity occurred in 1 patient (1.9%) only. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT is an effective treatment for low- and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base offering high local control rates with low toxicity

After 40 Gy/4 weeks of conventional fractionation we have accelerated the treatment in the last week giving two daily fractions of 2 Gy each, 4-6 h apart in the bladder only. Although the follow-up of some of the patients is not very long our results indicate that this relatively short radiotherapeutic scheme is feasible, convenient and probably safe for patients living in remote areas	
0	4663	Proton therapy of uveal melanomas: intercomparison of MRI-based and conventional treatment planning	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Berlin, Eye, Female, Germany, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk, Safety, Tantalum, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton therapy for uveal melanoma provides high-conformal dose application to the target volume and, thus, an optimal saving of the organs at risk nearby. Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity	
1	374	A technique of partial breast irradiation utilizing proton beam radiotherapy: comparison with conformal x-ray therapy.[see comment]	Breast, Breast Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Female, Heart, Humans, Immobilization, Immobilization/is [Instrumentation], Prone Position, Protons, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Skin/re [Radiation Effects], Treatment Outcome, Vacuum, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To develop a breast immobilization system and clinical technique to deliver partial breast irradiation with a proton beam and compare dose distributions using proton therapy and conformal x-rays. METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival

METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics

The proximity of both kidneys and the liver, and a more complex target configuration, can pose a dosimetric challenge for conventional X-ray treatment and intraoperative irradiation. We utilized proton radiation therapy (PRT) to reduce dose to uninvolved kidneys, liver, intestine, and spinal cord. PROCEDURE: A 4-year-old male underwent PRT for neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland, following chemotherapy and delayed surgical resection. Clinical target volume (CTV), boost volume, and normal structures were outlined on the 3D treatment planning CT scan. The patient received 25.2 CGE (cobalt Gray equivalent) to the CTV and 34.2 CGE to the boost region, using 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for target and nontarget structures. RESULTS: The 95% isodose volume enclosed CTV and boost volumes. The dose to 50% of the ipsilateral kidney, with tumor involvement of the medial renal surface, was < or = 16 CGE (47% of prescribed total dose). Doses to 50% and 20% of the contralateral kidney in close proximity to deep left-side, paraspinal soft tissue involvement were restricted to 1 CGE and 10 CGE, respectively. Eighty percent of the liver received 27 CGE (80% of prescribed dose). Using a patch technique, unique to charged particle therapy, the spinal cord was almost completely spared during boost volume irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: PRT can achieve excellent dose conformity for advanced retroperitoneal, paraspinal lesions, while respecting normal tissue tolerance levels. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc	
0	4217	Comparative treatment planning: proton vs. x-ray beams against glioblastoma multiforme	Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Image Processing,Computer-Assisted, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Temporal Lobe, X-Rays	The survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is extremely poor, the 5-year survival rate being almost zero. The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions	
1	340	The impact of dose escalation on secondary cancer risk after radiotherapy of prostate cancer	Computer Simulation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Humans, Male, Models,Biological, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Photons, Physics, Probability, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostatic Neoplasms/co [Complications], Prostatic Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data], Risk, Risk Assessment/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Switzerland	PURPOSE: To estimate secondary cancer risk due to dose escalation in patients treated for prostatic carcinoma with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and spot-scanned proton RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose (OED) concept with a linear-exponential, a plateau, and a linear dose-response curve was applied to dose distributions of 23 patients who received RT of prostate cancer. Conformal RT was used in 7 patients, 8 patients received IMRT with 6- and 15-MV photons, and 8 patients were treated with spot-scanned protons. We applied target doses ranging from 70 Gy to 100 Gy. Cancer risk was estimated as a function of target dose and tumor control probability. RESULTS: At a 100-Gy target dose the secondary cancer risk relative to the 3D treatment plan at 70 Gy was +18.4% (15.0% for a plateau model, 22.3% for a linear model) for the 6-MV IMRT plan, +25.3% (17.0%, 14.1%) for the 15-MV IMRT plan, and -40.7% (-41.3%, -40.0%) for the spot-scanned protons. The increasing risk of developing a radiation-associated malignancy after RT with increasing dose was balanced by the enhanced cure rates at a larger dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk after dose escalation for prostate RT is expected to be equal to or lower than for conventional 3D treatment at 70 Gy, independent of treatment modality or dose-response model. Spot-scanned protons are the treatment of choice for dose escalation because this therapy can halve the risk of secondary cancers	
0	1105	A treatment planning comparison of intensity modulated photon and proton therapy for paraspinal sarcomas	Cobalt, Heart, Humans, Lead, Liver, Lung, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Sarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach, Switzerland	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between intensity modulated (IM) photon therapy and IM proton therapy (IMPT) in paraspinal sarcomas, so as to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. In the case of IM proton therapy, plans were compared also for two different sizes of the pencil beam. Finally, a 10% and 20% dose escalation with IM protons was planned, and the consequential organ at risk (OAR) irradiation was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plans for 5 patients were computed for IM photons (7 coplanar fields) and protons (3 coplanar beams), using the KonRad inverse treatment planning system (developed at the German Cancer Research Center). IMPT planning was performed assuming 2 different sizes of the pencil beam: IMPT with a beam of full width at half-maximum of 20 mm, and IMPT with a "mini-beam" (IMPT(M), full width at half-maximum = 12 mm). Prescribed dose was 77.4 Gy or cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) for protons to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Surface and center spinal cord dose constraint for all techniques was 64 and 53 Gy/CGE, respectively. Tumor and OAR dose-volume histograms were calculated. Results were analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, inhomogeneity coefficient, and conformity index. RESULTS: Gross tumor volume coverage was optimal and equally homogeneous with both IM photon and IM proton plans. Compared to the IM photon plans, the use of IM proton beam therapy leads to a substantial reduction of the OAR total integral dose in the low-level to mid-dose level. Median heart, lung, kidney, stomach, and liver mean dose and dose at the 50% volume level were consistently reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 25. Tumor dose homogeneity in IMPT(M) plans was always better than with IMPT planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient, 0.19 vs. 0.25). IMPT dose escalation (to 92.9 CGE to the GTV) was possible in all patients without exceeding the normal-tissue dose limits. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of IM photon therapy, when compared to IM protons, can result in similar levels of tumor conformation. IM proton therapy, however, reduces the OAR integral dose substantially, compared to IM photon radiation therapy. As a result, tumor dose escalation was always possible with IM proton planning, within the maximal OAR dose constraints. In IM proton planning, reducing the size of the proton pencil beam (using the "mini-beam") improved the dose homogeneity, but it did not have a significant effect on the dose conformity

This study, prompted by reports of transient (30% each) and permanent (10% each) facial and trigeminal neuropathy after stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas with marginal doses of 16-20 Gy, assessed whether proton beam radiosurgery using a marginal dose of only 12 Gy could control vestibular schwannomas while causing less neuropathy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 67 years) were treated between 1992 and 1998. The mean tumor volume was 2.49 cm(3). The dose to the tumor margin (70% isodose line) was 12 Gy. The prospectively specified follow-up consisted of neurologic evaluation and MRI at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: After a mean clinical follow-up of 44 months and imaging follow-up of 34 months in 64 patients, 35 tumors (54.7%) were smaller and 25 (39.1%) were unchanged (tumor control rate 94%; actuarial control rate 94% at 2 years and 84% at 5 years). Three tumors enlarged: one shrank after repeated radiosurgery, one remained enlarged at the time of unrelated death, and one had not been imaged for 4 years in a patient who remained asymptomatic at last follow-up. Intratumoral hemorrhage into one stable tumor required craniotomy that proved successful. Thus, 97% of tumors required no additional treatment. Three patients (4.7%) underwent shunting for hydrocephalus evident as increased ataxia. Of 6 patients with functional hearing ipsilaterally, 1 improved, 1 was unchanged, and 4 progressively lost hearing. Cranial neuropathies were infrequent: persistent facial hypesthesia (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%); intermittent facial paresthesias (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%); persistent facial weakness (2 new, 1 exacerbated; 4.7%) requiring oculoplasty; transient partial facial weakness (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%), and synkinesis (5 new, 1 exacerbated; 9.4%). CONCLUSION: Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas at the doses used in this study controls tumor growth with relatively few complications

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients treated between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients presented with locally recurrent (n = 17), T2 (n = 20), high-grade (n = 26), or incompletely resected tumors (n = 11). All patients underwent limbsparing surgery and IORT (median dose of 15 Gy) given either with high-dose-rate brachytherapy or a linear accelerator. 25 patients received additional EBRT with a mean of 50.6 Gy (range: 30.6-60 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-5.6 years). RESULTS: The 5-year overall and distant disease-free survival rates were 66% and 54%, respectively. The overall actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years is 16% (95% CI: 1%, 31%). The crude rate after 8 years is 18%. Surgical margin status, primary versus recurrent tumor and tumor stage did not show any statistically significant influence (univariate analysis) on local recurrence rates. Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas, IORT +/- EBRT after limb-preserving surgery achieves high local control rates. The risk of normal tissue toxicities is comparable to conventional limb-sparing treatment

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival

Irradiated tumors showed more likely necrosis (p = 0.01) had balloon cells (p = 0.01), and inflammatory infiltrate (p = 0.05). In the irradiated group, the prevalence of tumor blood vessel damage was higher (p = 0.0002) and mitotic figures were fewer (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that proton beam irradiation damages tumor cells and alters the tumor's capacity for cellular reproduction. It damages blood vessels leading to tumor necrosis. It induces an inflammatory response of unknown effects. Radiosensitivity of choroidal melanomas cannot be assessed using conventional histologic methods. However, tumor necrosis, mitotic activity and rate of balloon cells can help to establish tumoral sensitivity to irradiation

The time-attenuation curves, time of appearance and recovery, and 3D size reduction pattern are described in patients of different ages and genders with different irradiation doses, irradiated portals, and Child groups. METHOD: Forty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 50 to 84 Gy proton beam irradiation in periods of 14-52 days. CT including noncontrast and dynamic study was performed every 3 months starting 3 weeks after the end of irradiation. The 3D volume measurement of areas of radiation-induced hepatic injury was performed through incremental dynamic CT images in every follow-up study. CT follow-up study of the patients was done for 12-76 months. RESULTS: Radiation-induced hepatic injury was observed as low attenuation areas on noncontrast CT and enhanced areas on dynamic study in the regions corresponding to the irradiation portals. Of our cases, 67.5% showed the appearance of radiation hepatitis in 3-4 weeks and 95.3% in 3-4 months after the end of irradiation. In both periods, there was a significant delay in the female patients. The time-attenuation curve showed an early and prolonged enhancement of the irradiated regions. The volume reduction pattern of the injured areas was found to be longstanding, exponential, and directed from periphery to the center. CONCLUSION: Early appearance of radiation-induced hepatic injury was found only to be gender dependent, with a tendency to occur with higher irradiated doses; no other parameters affected this phenomenon in our cases. Disappearance of the injured areas, if present, takes a long time (at least 42 months)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 42 patients with solitary lytic metastasis in weight-bearing bones were studied. Primary endpoints were the mean value and energy of gray-level histogram in plain radiographs (MVGLH and EGLH) and relative electron density (RED) of CT scans in bone lesions. In eleven patients (group A) the DP dose was increased stepwise from 90 up to 180 mg (flat dose), while in other 15 patients (group B) a flat dose of 180 mg was administered intravenously in 2 h. In both groups, the first session of DP was given concurrently with local radiotherapy (30 Gy in ten fractions, 5 days a week). Another 16 patients (group C) underwent radiotherapy only. RESULTS: Morbidity related to pamidronate was mild. Significant differences from the baseline (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) were recorded for MVGLH, EGLH and RED values, regarding all groups. Improvement was significantly higher in patients of group B versus A, while the results of pamidronate groups (A and B) were superior to group C, concerning the above indices (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, pamidronate groups had significantly lower skeletal morbidity than group C. CONCLUSION: The 2-h infusional flat dose of 180 mg every 4 weeks seems to be tolerable and superior to 90 mg regarding palliation and mainly recalcification of osteolytic lesions. Radiotherapy alone is effective but inferior to the combined treatment. Last but not least, the findings of MVGLH, EGLH and RED indicate an important increase in bone mass and bone formation, which was difficult to be identified visually by the experts

The authors report the results of treatment of 10 patients, six with chordoma, three with chondrosarcoma, and one with a neurofibrosarcoma. Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed

[French]	Adult, Aged, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Combined Modality Therapy, Conjunctival Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Conjunctival Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Conjunctival Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cryosurgery, Cryotherapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/et [Etiology], Orbit, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Risk, Skin, Switzerland, Visual Acuity/ph [Physiology]	BACKGROUND: Conjunctival melanomas are malignant tumors with a high local recurrence rate after simple surgical excision. The rate of recurrence is particularly high in cases of large size tumor, of widespread tumors and with PAM associated lesions. Tumor recurrences have a bad long-term prognostic significance and often necessitate exenteration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A method of therapy combining total surgical excision with proton-beam irradiation, cobalt plaque irradiation and cryotherapy is described. This technique is used in particular unfavorable cases with the aim of lowering the rate of recurrences. It was practiced in 19 cases in Lausanne, 10 of which were recurrent tumors. The melanoma invaded 3 quadrants of the bulbar conjunctiva in 8 cases and 4 quadrants in 11 cases. At least one neighbouring tarsal conjunctiva was invaded in 11 cases and both in 7 cases. The skin of the eyelid was infiltrated in 6 cases and the caruncle in 9 cases. Tumor thickness was 1 to 2 mm in 8 cases, 3 to 4 mm in 4 cases and 5 to 10 mm in 7 cases. RESULTS: PAM was present in 16 cases. Follow-up period was less than 1 year in 2 cases, between 1 to 2 years in 5 cases, between 2 to 3 years in 5 cases and more than 3 years in 7 cases. 5 patients had lymph node metastases, 3 died of metastatic disease and 2 had a local recurrence. One of these recurrences was small-sized and was excised, the other was widespread and the patient died soon with metastatic disease. No exenteration was performed. CONCLUSION: The method of therapy that is here described appears to be a valuable alternative to exenteration of the orbit for the treatment of diffuse or large-size conjunctival melanomas which have a high risk of local recurrence	
1	1912	Risk factors for radiation maculopathy and papillopathy after intraocular irradiation	Aged, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Cohort Studies, Eye, Female, Humans, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Optic Disk/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve, Prospective Studies, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Risk, Risk Factors, Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To evaluate rates of occurrence and risk factors for radiation maculopathy and radiation papillopathy in patients with choroidal melanoma at high risk for these complications. DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 558 patients treated with proton irradiation for choroidal melanoma between 1986 and 1996 with small to moderate sized tumors (less than 5 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter) located within 4 disc diameters of the macula or optic nerve and with a median ocular follow-up of 4 years. METHODS: Annual and cumulative rates of each endpoint were estimated using life table approaches. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss to worse than 20/100. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year rates for radiation maculopathy, radiation papillopathy, and vision loss were 64%, 35%, and 68%, respectively. Complication rates rose as a function of radiation exposure to the macula (P for trend = 0.04) or optic disc (P for trend < 0.001), although dose-response patterns were nonlinear. History of diabetes was a significant risk factor for maculopathy (P < 0.001) and optic neuropathy (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of radiation vasculopathy is determined primarily by the degree of irradiation exposure to the macula and optic disc. Risk may be enhanced among those with underlying vascular disorders

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

These tumours are rare and occur in difficult anatomical regions. We reviewed the local control and survival of patients treated in our centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 12 adult cases of chordoma (nine) and chondrosarcoma (three) in the skull base or cervical spine were treated in our centre. The median follow-up is currently 38 months. One patient was treated with palliative intent. In 10 cases the prescription dose was 65 Gy in 39 fractions. The target volumes were measured, and the target maximum and minimum doses and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the phase I plans were recorded. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 11 of 12 cases. One chordoma patient failed locally, and one other died of metastatic disease despite local control. The 3- and 5-year cause-specific survival for the series was 88 and 75%, respectively. The mean phase I planning target volume (PTV) was 120.4 cm(3). The median minimum dose in the phase I PTV was 81.0%. The median EUD (expressed as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for the phase I PTV, calculated using a value for the exponent a of -15, was 98.3%. The phase I EUD was below 80% in two of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a need for aggressive local surgery and high-dose radiotherapy, and endorse multidisciplinary working. Although charged particle therapy is accepted as providing optimal treatment plans, in eight of our patients travel abroad would not have been feasible. This series provides encouraging results for carefully planned photon conformal radiotherapy, carried out in close collaboration with a specialist surgical team

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen children, 4 to 18 years of age, with base of skull or cervical spine chordomas, received fractionated high-dose postoperative radiation using mixed photon and 160 MeV proton beams. The median tumor dose was 69 Cobalt Gray-equivalent (CGE) with a 1.8 CGE daily fraction. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 68% and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 63%. The only significant prognostic factor was the location: patients with cervical spine chordomas had a worse survival than those with base of skull lesions (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-related morbidity was acceptable: two patients developed a growth hormone deficit corrected by hormone replacement, one temporal lobe necrosis, and one fibrosis of the temporalis muscle, improved by surgery. CONCLUSION: Chordomas in children behave similarly to those in adults: children can receive the same high-dose irradiation as adults with acceptable morbidity

Prolactin concentrations reduced both in macro- and microprolactinomas patients. The response was achieved in 96% of the cases in adenoma stages I-IIIa. Such results are superior to those reached with other treatment modalities. The efficacy of the above proton treatment can be raised by adjuvant use of chemotherapy

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites

Among these 86 cases were admitted primarily with view of treatment. Within the period conception of therapy was changed drastically. Where as in former time treatment consists in excision of the tumour with following conventional X-ray therapy, since 1973 therapy of choice was radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphonodectomy. Based on these facts a retrospective comparison of the survival rates in possible, particularly distribution of stages is likely the same in the two groups. The group treated since 1973 has essential better survival rates. This can be attributed to the conception of radical operative treatment preferred in literature predominantly. Mortality rate is below 5 per cent which will be favourable in the geriatric clientele. To make the results of treatment comparable internationally a postoperative classification should be proposed like in breast cancer. The question of the position of an additional postoperative irradiation is to be answered only with aid of a prospective multicenter study

METHODS: Retrospective review of 78 patients with 60 medium and 18 large-size choroidal melanomas at a median follow-up of 34 months. RESULTS: The 5-year data for local control, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were estimated to be 90.5 +/- 3.7%, 76.2 +/- 6.7%, and 75.6 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Eye preservation was achieved in 75.3% of patients, with useful (better than 20/200) visual acuity (VA) in 49.1% of surviving patients. Both local failure and complications led to enucleation. Prognosticators were tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.003), large tumors involving the ciliary body (p = 0.041), and local failure (p < 0.001). Prognostic factors for VA following PRT were initial VA (p = 0.001), doses to optic disc (p = 0.001) and fovea (p = 0.022) higher than 35 CGE (Cobalt Gray equivalent), tumor close to the optic disc (p = 0.034), and retinal detachment (p < 0.001). Tumor basis diameter was significantly related to metastases free survival (p = 0.02), overall survival (p = 0.033), and disease specific survival (p = 0.017), but did not impair local tumor control, rate of enucleation, and VA. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that PRT is an effective and safe treatment for medium and large size choroidal melanoma. PRT can preserve the eye and its function in a reasonable percentage of patients. Further evaluation in controlled clinical trials comparing PRT to plaque radiotherapy and enucleation is required

METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 2004, 11 patients (four were recurrences because they previously had been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy) underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas at the Neurosurgical Department of Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. The transsphenoidal endoscopic approach and the ethmoid-pterygo-sphenoidal endoscopic approach were used to accomplish resection of the lesions involving the clivus and extending up to the parasellar region and to the petrous apex, or within the cavernous sinus. RESULTS: Patient follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 69 months (mean, 27 mo). Three patients died of chordoma progression at 20, 14, and 10 months, respectively, after endoscopic treatment. One patient experienced two recurrences; the first was treated using a new endoscopic approach, whereas the second, 1 year later, was treated by means of a far lateral approach. Four patients underwent postoperative proton beam radiotherapy, whereas one underwent a conventional megavoltage x-radiation therapy. However, postoperative radiotherapy was not administered in the two patients treated for cranial base chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: The flexibility of this new technique with respect to the classical microscopic transsphenoidal approach permits us to widen the horizon of surgical management of aggressive cranial base tumors such as clival chordomas and chondrosarcomas

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma

DESIGN: Randomized dose-ranging clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with angiographic evidence of classic choroidal neovascularization resulting from AMD and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better. METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 16-cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) or 24-CGE proton radiation in 2 equal fractions. Visual acuity was measured using standardized protocol refraction. Complete ophthalmological examinations, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of eyes losing 3 or more lines of vision from baseline. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare cumulative rates of vision loss between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS: At 12 months after treatment, 36 eyes (42%) and 27 eyes (35%) lost 3 or more lines of vision in the 16-CGE and 24-CGE groups, respectively. Rates increased to 62% in the 16-CGE group and 53% in the 24-CGE group by 24 months after treatment (P = 0.40). Radiation complications developed in 15.7% of patients receiving 16 CGE and 14.8% of patients receiving 24 CGE. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in rates of visual loss were found between the 2 dose groups. Proton radiation may be useful as an adjuvant therapy or as an alternative for patients who decline or are not appropriate for approved therapies

One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi.

The NIRS (National Institute For Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan) was the first dedicated medical centre for cancer with more than 1200 patients exclusively treated with carbon ion from 1994. A three-year 70 to 100% local control was reported for radio-resistant cancers, supporting the use of high LET particles. Hypo-fractionation was particularly explored for lung cancers and hepatocarcinoma (4 sessions only). Dose escalation studies demonstrated a tumour dose-effect and permitted to precise dose constraints for healthy tissues especially for the rectum. More than 140 patients were treated with carbon ion exclusively or associated with photons since 1997 in the GSI laboratory Gesellschaft Fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany). A very high local control was also obtained for radioresistant cancer of the base of the skull. Preliminary clinical data seem to confirm the expected therapeutic gain with light ions, due to their ballistic and radio-biological properties, and justify the European projects for the construction of dedicated medical facilities for cancers. The French "Etoile" project will be integrated in the European hadrontherapy network "Enlight", with the objectives to coordinate technologic, medical and economic features

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors	
1	2912	Current results of proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	Proton beam irradiation has been used for the treatment of 241 uveal melanomas over the past 7 1/2 years. Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient). Complications following treatment with electrons to a spinal field are compared with reported complications following treatment with photons to the spinal field. Although short-term reactions were minimal, the authors found no difference in late complications. More sophisticated treatment planning may show such a long-term benefit in the future	
0	2144	Change in radiosensitivity with fractionated-dose irradiation of carbon-ion beams in five different human cell lines	Carbon, Carbon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Cell Line, Cell Survival/ph [Physiology], Cell Survival/re [Radiation Effects], Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Fibroblasts/ph [Physiology], Fibroblasts/re [Radiation Effects], Heavy Ions/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Ions, Japan, Linear Energy Transfer, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiobiology, Research, Tumor Cells,Cultured/ph [Physiology], Tumor Cells,Cultured/re [Radiation Effects], Tumor Stem Cell Assay, X-Rays	PURPOSE: To investigate the change in the surviving fractions by fractionated-dose irradiations with carbon ions, based on the recovery of potentially lethal damage (PLDR) and the change of radiosensitivity by every fractionated-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One normal human and four human-tumor cell lines were used. Cells were irradiated with carbon ions accelerated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan. The LET values were estimated to be 13.18 keV/microm for low-LET beams and 76.92 +/- 0.20 keV/microm for high-LET beams. Fractionated-dose irradiations were carried out with 5 fractions within a 24-h interval. RESULTS: The surviving fractions for the fractionated-dose irradiation with X-rays and carbon ions decreased exponentially with increasing the number of fractions in the tumor cell lines. In contrast, the surviving fractions for the carbon ions in normal human cells decreased exponentially as well as the tumor cell lines, while it tended to level off from the 3rd to the 5th fraction in the case of using X-rays. CONCLUSION: The change in both the recovery ratio of the PLDR and radiosensitivity by every fractionated-dose irradiation depends on individual cell lines and the quality of radiations

The patient maintained good vision until 18 months after therapy, when she developed neovascular glaucoma. This complication required multiple therapeutic procedures, including topical anti-inflammatory and antiglaucomatous drops, 360 degrees peripheral panretinal cryoblation, and a single 180 degrees application of inferior cyclocryotherapy over a 2 1/2-year period. Four weeks after the cyclocryotherapy, inflammation was noted in both eyes, and, one month later, enucleation of the left sympathogenic eye was performed. Serial histopathologic sections showed a full-thickness, fibrovascular, scleral scar and tantalum marker ring suture without uveal incarceration. Penetrating surgical trauma, a uveal melanoma, and multiple nonpenetrating treatments resulted in the development of sympathetic ophthalmia

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

[French]	Aged, Ciliary Body, Efficiency, Female, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Protons, Recurrence, Time Factors, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	A malignant ciliary body melanoma was treated by proton-beam irradiation. Ring-shaped recurrence with extraocular extension appeared thirty-six months later and required enucleation. Histologic study revealed a predominant epithelioid cell type tumor, flattened in previously treated area. Proton-beam irradiation efficiency depends on clinical evaluation, which remains questioned in ciliary body locations where circumferential extension could be misevaluated

Choroidal biopsy confirmed that the clinical diagnosis and conventional radiotherapy to one eye resulted in rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, cataract, and vitreous hemorrhage. We were able to destroy the tumors in the other eye by photocoagulation and proton beam irradiation without any adverse effects. The patient is in good health 1 1/2 years after therapy and he has 6/6 (20/20) vision in the eye that was treated	
1	3410	Long-term results of helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Glaucoma,Neovascular/ep [Epidemiology], Helium, Humans, Ions, Melanoma, Melanoma/ep [Epidemiology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/ep [Epidemiology], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Risk Factors, Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Uveal Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	Between 1978 and 1988, 307 patients with uveal melanoma were irradiated using helium ions at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The length of follow-up ranged from 1-115 months (median 42 months). The 5-year actuarial treatment results were: local control rate, 96.8%, determinate survival rate, 81%, freedom from distant metastases, 76%, eye retention rate, 83%, and risk of developing neovascular glaucoma, 36%. Long-term vision outcome was analyzed in 81 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Forty-seven percent of patients retained vision of 20/200 or better. The median change in vision was a loss of four lines on the standard eye chart. Thirty-eight percent of patients had visual acuity either improve or remain within two lines of their pretreatment vision. A multivariate analysis identified tumor size as the only independently significant risk factor affecting survival, development of neovascular glaucoma, or the risk of enucleation; no risk factor correlated with local recurrence. Tumor size, tumor-fovea distance, and pretreatment visual acuity were independently significant risk factors influencing vision outcome. These results confirm that helium ion irradiation is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma which combines high rates of local control, survival, and eye retention with a substantial likelihood of long-term vision preservation

The first series of patients include 37 with lesions in the brain, 5 in the thorax and 28 in the abdomen. The main advantages of NMR-CT are as follows: No ionizing irradiation exists. Sagittal and frontal tomograms are easily produced. Chemical status of tissue is shown by relaxation times (T1, T2) and proton density. Vascular structures are easily recognized and the blood flow can be estimated. Less bone artifacts are produced compared with X-ray CT. (XCT)	
0	4324	Dose volume histogram analysis of liver radiation tolerance	Helium, Humans, Ions, Liver, Liver Neoplasms/pc [Prevention & Control], Liver Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Liver/re [Radiation Effects], Neon, Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Patient Care Planning, Radiation, Radiation Tolerance, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research	Eleven patients with carcinoma of the pancreas or biliary system received heavy charged particle radiation treatments and whole liver heavy charged particle radiation at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Doses to the whole liver ranged from 10 to 24 Gray-equivalent (the biological equivalent of 10 to 24 Gray of low-LET photon radiation), whereas the dose to the primary lesion ranged from 53.5 to 70 Gray-equivalent (GyE). The fraction size was 2 to 3 GyE. The liver received partial as well as whole organ irradiation. Integral dose volume histograms for the liver were obtained in all 11 patients. An integral dose volume histogram displays on the ordinate the percentage of liver that was irradiated in excess of the dose specified on the abcissa. In this study, the clinical liver radiation tolerance of these patients is correlated with the information contained in an integral dose volume histogram. One patient developed radiation hepatitis. The integral dose volume histogram of this patient differed from the dose volume histograms of the other 10 patients. This difference was greatest in the range of doses between 30 and 40 GyE. Our results suggest that liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction in addition to primary radiation of the pancreas or biliary system

The patient retained 6/7.5 visual acuity for 2 1/2 years before he was killed in an automobile accident. The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision	
0	447	Effect of anatomic motion on proton therapy dose distributions in prostate cancer treatment	Calibration, Femur Head/ra [Radiography], Humans, Male, Motion, Movement, Physics, Prostate, Prostate/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Rectum/ra [Radiography], Research, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Urinary Bladder/ra [Radiography]	PURPOSE: To determine the dosimetric impact of interfraction anatomic movements in prostate cancer patients receiving proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities	
0	2906	Proton irradiation of small choroidal malignant melanomas	Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Eye, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Nuclear Energy, Ophthalmoscopy, Protons, Radiography, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Research, Sclera, Tantalum, Transillumination	Five patients with choroidal malignant melanomas were treated with proton irradiation with a cyclotron. We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments

Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome

1	8	Proton irradiation of malignant uveal melanoma. A five year follow-up of patients treated in Uppsala, Sweden	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Protons, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Twenty patients with malignant uveal melanoma were treated at the The Svedbergh cyclotron in Uppsala from 1989 to 1991. Each tumour received a total dose of 54.6 Gy in four equal fractions on four following days. After treatment the melanoma in all eyes showed decrease in size combined with irradiation retinopathy. In eight patients the treatment was successful after five years. Nine eyes had to be enucleated, two due to recurrence and seven due to neovascular glaucoma. Three patients died, two from metastases and one from heart disease. In all patients the visual acuity was dependent on the distance between the irradiation field and the macula or optic nerve. Each patient suffered from transient post irradiation skin erythema and permanent loss of eyelashes and eyebrows when these were included in the irradiation field. The development of secondary glaucoma was positively correlated with tumour volume, but not to the age or sex of the patients. Histological examination of all the enucleated eyes revealed residual viable tumour without obvious radiation damage: mitotic figures were not identified. MRI examination, performed before and after treatment, demonstrated a marked shift in water binding properties after irradiation. The final visual acuity was dependent on the location of the tumour

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation	
1	1827	Radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastases in renal cell carcinoma. [Review] [36 refs]	Bone Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Bone Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Renal Cell/su [Surgery], Germany, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Lead, Melanoma, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Survival, Survival Rate, Universities	BACKGROUND: In the treatment of brain metastases using a stereotactically modified linear accelerator it could be shown that a single dose between 15 and 25 Gy leads to partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from melanoma and hypernephroma. Radiosurgery of brain metastases then started in centers all over the world, however, experiences with brain metastases of renal cell carcinoma are yet limited. The aim of this analysis is therefore to present the treatment results of radiosurgery of brain metastases. Furthermore, in this paper prognostic subgroups shall be defined, in order to establish guidelines for an optimal therapy strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiosurgery means stereotactically guided high-precision irradiation methods by extremely focussing ionizing radiation within the target volume as a single dose application. The characteristic steep dose decrease allows the selective destruction of small intracranial lesions, while the surrounding brain tissue is optimally protected. Two methods, Gamma Knife and stereotactic modified linear accelerator are clinically available. RESULTS: In larger studies from different groups all over the world, local tumor control rates from 85% to 95%, recurrence rates from 6% to 15% and side effects between 3% and 15% have been attained, independent of the system used. Prognostic factors, like volume of metastases < 10 ml, applied dose > 18 Gy, one or two metastases, absence of extracranial metastases, good patient performance with a Karnofsky score > 70%, primary treatment and more than one year between primary diagnosis and brain metastases showed a trend toward improved survival. Depending on the prognostic factors the median survival after radiosurgery ranged from 6 to 12 months. Retrospective comparison of radiosurgery and surgical series suggest that both modalities attain similar results. The dose can be applied with an accuracy of 0.3 mm. DISCUSSION: Based on these experiences, brain metastases can be treated by radiosurgery, primarily in patients with one or two metastases or in combination with whole brain irradiation as a boost in patients with more than two metastases. Furthermore with radiosurgery a new treatment modality exists to re-irradiate patients who have been failed after surgery or whole brain irradiation. [References: 36]	
0	2466	Extended field irradiation in the treatment of patients with cervical carcinoma involving biopsy proven para-aortic nodes	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Aged, Aorta, Biopsy, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Lead, Lymphatic Metastasis/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Survival, Survivors, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Between November 1974 and November 1979, 15 patients with cervical carcinoma were treated with extended field irradiation for biopsy proven para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastases. Treatment consisted of pelvic and para-aortic irradiation at a daily dose of 180 to 200 rad per day, delivering 4000 to 6000 rad to the pelvis and 4000 to 5000 rad to the para-aortic nodes. One or two intracavitary insertions each delivered an additional 2000 to 3500 rad to point A. The three year actual disease free survival for the 12 patients with Stage I and II disease was 50%. All six survivors remain alive without evidence of disease for 41 to 93 months, with a mean and median follow-up of 65 months. All patients dying of disease did so within 26 months, all but one dying within one year. All patients with Stage III and IV are dead of disease. Pelvic disease was controlled in 11 of 12 patients with Stage I or II disease, and in one of the three patients with Stage III and IV disease. There was no clinical indication of failure in the PALN in any patient. Nine patients failed with disseminated disease. Three of 15 patients (20%) suffered serious treatment-related complications. Two of these were attributed to the pelvic irradiation, with one patient requiring a colostomy. Thus, complications resulting from the extended field irradiation were seen in only one patient (6.7%). There was no treatment related mortality. Extended field irradiation can lead to a 50% survival in patients with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma and PALN metastases, a survival comparable to that reported in patients with involved pelvic nodes	
0	4713	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry of the head and neck: a comparison of treatment plans using linear accelerator-based IMRT and helical tomotherapy	Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Methods, Neck, Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Gland, Particle Accelerators, Patients, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography,Spiral Computed/mt [Methods], Tonsillar Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	PURPOSE: To date, most intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery has occurred using linear accelerators (linacs), although helical tomotherapy has become commercially available. To quantify the dosimetric difference, we compared linac-based and helical tomotherapy-based treatment plans for IMRT of the oropharynx. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We compared the dosimetry findings of 10 patients who had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Five patients each had cancers in the base of the tongue and tonsil. Each plan was independently optimized using either the CORVUS planning system (Nomos Corporation, Sewickly, PA), commissioned for a Varian 2300 CD linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with 1-cm multileaf collimator leaves, or helical tomotherapy. The resulting treatment plans were evaluated by comparing the dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), dose uniformity, and normal tissue complication probabilities. RESULTS: Helical tomotherapy plans showed improvement of critical structure avoidance and target dose uniformity for all patients. The average equivalent uniform dose reduction for organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the base of tongue and the tonsil were 17.4% and 27.14% respectively. An 80% reduction in normal tissue complication probabilities for the parotid glands was observed in the tomotherapy plans relative to the linac-based plans. The standard deviation of the planning target volume dose was reduced by 71%. In our clinic, we use the combined dose-volume histograms for each class of plans as a reference goal for helical tomotherapy treatment planning optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy provides improved dose homogeneity and normal structure dose compared with linac-based IMRT in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma resulting in a reduced risk for complications from focal hotspots within the planning target volume and for the adjacent parotid glands

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. A total of 2645 patients (2648 eyes) with uveal melanoma were treated between 1984 and 1999 with proton beam radiotherapy. Data were analyzed as of February 2001. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 90 years, 1284 were men, and 1361 were women. Largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 27.5 mm, and tumor height from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization

METHODS: We retrospectively identified four patients who presented with uveal melanoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment simultaneously and six patients in whom a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed 11-100 months (mean, 44.8 months) after radiotherapy for a choroidal melanoma. RESULTS: All four patients with simultaneous presentation of uveal melanoma and retinal detachment underwent successful retinal detachment repair (cases 1 and 4, scleral buckle; case 2, pars plana vitrectomy, and case 3, pneumatic retinoplexy). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurring after proton beam or plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma was repaired successfully in five of six patients with scleral buckling alone or in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. In the short follow-up period of this study, we did not observe tumor recurrence either before or after retinal detachment repair. CONCLUSION: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with uveal melanoma may be treated successfully using conventional retinal surgical techniques. The benefits of retinal detachment repair must be weighed against any theoretical increased risk of extra-scleral extension of the melanoma. Long-term follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the safety of various retinal detachment repair techniques in these eyes

A retrospective study	Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intestinal Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Intestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Male, Morbidity, Norway/ep [Epidemiology], Particle Accelerators, Questionnaires, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Urologic Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Urologic Diseases/et [Etiology]	48 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer were asked by a mailed questionnaire concerning post-radiotherapy functional status, urological and intestinal complaints. All patients had received curative pelvic irradiation (greater than or equal to 1750 reu) nine to 133 months prior to the investigation. Eleven patients had recurrent or persistent disease and four (36%) of these patients had severe hematuria. The urinary morbidity of the 37 patients without evidence of disease varied between 24 and 38%, but only 3 to 8% of these patients experienced severe disturbances. Four patients (9%) had to undergo bowl resection due to severe radiation damage in the intestines. In conclusion, slight morbidity after curative radiation treatment is to be expected in about 30% of patients surviving more than six months. Severe complications may be expected in 10% of the patients. Serious complaints from the urologic tract, especially hematuria, indicate recurrent or persistent disease rather than a late radiation effect	
0	4077	Definitive proton beam radiation therapy for inoperable gastric cancer: a report of two cases	Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Japan, Male, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Skin, Stomach Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Stomach Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Stomach Ulcer/di [Diagnosis], Stomach Ulcer/pa [Pathology], Stomach/pa [Pathology], Universities	Proton beam radiation therapy using 250 MeV protons was carried out on two patients with early gastric cancer (T1, N0, M0). One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

Fast neutrons, 30 MeV d-Be, were used to treat patients who had malignant melanoma in order to confirm the biological effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation for tumor control. Seventy-two patients suffering from malignant melanoma participated in the clinical trials with fast neutrons between November 1975 and December 1986. Of 72 patients, 45 had melanoma of the skin, 20 had melanoma of the head and neck, and seven had choroidal melanoma. Five-year survival rate of the patients who had previously untreated melanoma of the skin was 61% and for patients who received postoperative irradiation, it was 35.7% whereas no patients who had recurrent tumor survived over 4 years. Of 22 patients who had melanoma of the skin, stage I, local control in four cases was achieved by irradiation alone, whereas local control was achieved in 17 of 18 patients who required salvage surgery after fast-neutron therapy. The results of pathological studies performed with specimens obtained from salvage surgery have shown that melanoma cells growing in intradermal tissue are radio-resistant, compared with cells growing in intraepidermal tissue. This might suggest that melanoma cells acquire radioresistance when the connective tissue is involved. Five-year survival rate of the patients who had locally advanced melanoma of the head and neck, previously untreated, was 15.4%. Radiation therapy with accelerated protons was suitable for patients suffering from choroidal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In our clinic, selected patients were treated under a phase I institutional review board-approved SBRT protocol for limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors. Before treatment planning multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted on the periphery of the tumor. During treatment the EPID was used in cine mode to collect the exit radiation and produce a sequence of images for each field. An in-house program was developed for calculating the location of the fiducials and their relative distance to the planned locations. RESULTS: Three case studies illustrate the utility of the technique. Patient A exhibited a systematic shift of 4 mm during one of the treatment beams. Patient B showed an inferior drift of the target of approximately 1 cm from the time of setup to the end of the fraction. Patient C had a poor setup on the first day of treatment that was quantified and accounted for on subsequent treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: Target localization throughout each treatment beam can be quickly assessed with the presented technique. Treatment monitoring with an EPID in cine mode is shown to be a clinically feasible and useful tool

We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94%. One patient (2.2%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg

Most uveal melanomas were large, with a mean tumor thickness of 6.5 mm; approximately 60% of the patients had tumors that extended anterior to the equator. A complete follow-up was obtained for all patients. One hundred twelve patients were alive at the time of this report; 18% of the patients developed clinical and laboratory evidence of metastases and eventually died of widespread tumor. Eighty-four percent of eyes were retained. Data were analyzed with a number of parametric and nonparametric techniques. Larger tumors and those located in close proximity to the optic nerve and fovea had a higher incidence of most complications, especially visual loss

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart	
0	4215	Importance of precise positioning for proton beam therapy in the base of skull and cervical spine	Adult, Boston, Brain, Brain Stem, Cervical Vertebrae, Child, Chordoma, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Immobilization, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Probability, Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Skull, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Temporal Lobe, Uncertainty, X-Rays	Using proton beam therapy, high doses have been delivered to chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Dose inhomogeneity to the tumors has been accepted in order to maintain normal tissue tolerances, and detailed attention to patient immobilization and to precise positioning has minimized the margins necessary to ensure these dose constraints. This study examined the contribution of precise positioning to the better dose localization achieved in these treatments. Three patients whose tumors represented different anatomic geometries were studied. Treatment plans were developed which treated as much of the tumor as possible to 74 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) while maintaining the central brain stem and central spinal cord at less than or equal to 48 CGE, the surface of the brain stem, surface of the spinal cord, and optic structures at less than or equal to 60 CGE, and the temporal lobes at less than or equal to 5% likelihood of complication using a biophysical model of normal tissue complication probability. Two positioning accuracies were assumed: 3 mm and 10 mm. Both proton beam plans and 10 MV X ray beam plans were developed with these assumptions and dose constraints. In all cases with the same positioning uncertainties, the proton beam plans delivered more dose to a larger percentage of the tumor volume and the estimated tumor control probability was higher than with the X ray plans. However, without precise positioning both the proton plans and the X ray plans deteriorated, with a 12% to 25% decrease in estimated tumor control probability. In all but one case, the difference between protons with good positioning and poor positioning was greater than the difference between protons and X rays, both with good positioning. Hence in treating these tumors, which are in close proximity to critical normal tissues, attention to immobilization and precise positioning is essential. With good positioning, proton beam therapy permits higher doses to significantly more of the tumor in these sites than do X rays

DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective phase 1 study of choroidal melanoma patients with exudative retinal detachments. These tumors did not overhang the optic disc, involve the fovea, or have greater than 40% involvement of the ciliary body. Patients were treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with those of similar patients treated at the same institution with only proton radiation. Patients were followed up in an identical manner for loss of subretinal fluid, visual acuity change, and visual field alterations. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days, compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P<.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation may dissipate exudative detachments more rapidly than radiation alone

PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 17-year-old male patient underwent corpus callosotomy conformal SRS using a dedicated linear accelerator (linac) with dynamic arcs technique. The prescribed dose was 36.0 Gy at the periphery of the rostrum, genu, and a half of the body of the corpus callosum (CCA). At 8 months after conformal SRS, the patient developed a significant brain edema and moderate transitory motor deficit, which were controlled with steroids. After 32 months follow-up, there is an improvement of 84% on drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal SRS for corpus callosotomy with a single isocenter reproduce the results reported on literature using Gamma Knife-based SRS. The results show that this technique is safe and demonstrate its efficacy to control seizures

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect

For these 30 cases, the diagnosis was made by B ultrasonography only when the volume of the extension was important, between 20 and 2280 mm3. The Cox model multi-variant analysis was used to study the statistically significant parameters in the development of an extrascleral extension. It appears that the maximal diameter of the intraocular tumor (p = 0.0012), the localisation of the anterior margin (p = 0.0304) and the age of the patients (p = 0.0097) are statistically meaningful. The 4 years' survival, studied with the Kaplan-Meier curves, is estimated at 60% for the patients with extrascleral extension and at 85% for the patients without. These results are similar to those of literature, whatever treatment is chosen (enucleation and radiotherapy, exenteration)

Neuroimaging with technetium 99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid and positron emission tomographic scanning with fludeoxyglucose F 18 aided in his evaluation. Significant improvement of his neurologic deficits resulted from corticosteroid therapy. Clinical resolution was corroborated by serial computed tomographic scans demonstrating regression of the abnormality (a mass lesion). Various facets of radiation injury are discussed, including pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and therapy

A correlative study of histologic and clinical features of 62 cases	Adult, Biopsy, Boston, Chordoma, Chordoma/mo [Mortality], Chordoma/pa [Pathology], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/su [Surgery], Chordoma/ul [Ultrastructure], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Mitotic Index, Necrosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Sacrum, Sex Factors, Skull, Skull Base, Skull Neoplasms, Skull Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Skull Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Skull Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Skull Neoplasms/ul [Ultrastructure], Survival, Survival Rate	BACKGROUND. Chordomas are uncommon primary malignant tumors of bone that typically occur in the axial skeleton including the sacrum, vertebrae, and skull base. The base of skull tumors usually are not amenable to complete surgical resection, and most require postoperative radiotherapy. The natural history of skull base chordoma is typified by slow locally invasive tumor progression and eventual death, although few parameters are known that allow stratification of patients into prognostic groups. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with skull base chordomas treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital by proton beam irradiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up information were reviewed in an attempt to identify clinical and pathologic parameters that predicted outcome. RESULTS. Female sex, tumor necrosis in preradiation treatment biopsy, and tumor volume in excess of 70 ml were each independent predictors of shortened overall survival after radiation therapy for skull base chordoma. CONCLUSIONS. Stratification of patients with skull base chordoma into poor and good outcome groups can be performed using the three parameters identified in our study. In addition, the striking difference in survival between the sexes suggests that further investigations of these tumors should include determination of their hormonal receptors status and consideration of hormonal manipulation in their management

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

METHODS: Three hundred nineteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer and initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 15.0 ng/mL or less received conformal radiation doses of 74 to 75 cobalt gray equivalent with protons alone or combined with photons. No patient had pre- or post-treatment hormonal therapy until disease progression was documented. Patients were evaluated for biochemical disease-free survival, PSA nadir, and toxicity; the mean and median follow-up period was 43 months. RESULTS: Overall 5-year clinical and biochemical disease-free survival rates were 97% and 88%, respectively. Initial PSA level, stage, and post-treatment PSA nadir were independent prognostic variables for biochemical disease-free survival: a PSA nadir 0.5 ng/mL or less was associated with a 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rate of 98%, versus 88% and 42% for nadirs 0.51 to 1.0 and greater than 1.0 ng/mL, respectively. No severe treatment-related morbidity was seen. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that patients treated with conformal protons have 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rates comparable to those who undergo radical prostatectomy, and display no significant toxicity. A Phase III randomized dose-escalation trial is underway to define the optimum radiation dose for early-stage prostate cancer

[French]	Adult, Cobalt, Dose Fractionation, Female, France, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk	Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques.Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma	
0	1305	The efficacy of linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery in treating glomus jugulare tumors	Adult, Aged, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glomus Jugulare Tumor/su [Surgery], Hearing, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Retrospective Studies, Time, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	Treatment of glomus jugulare tumors with radiosurgery has grown in acceptance since the first reported treatment in 1995, but only a few centers have reported their experiences with limited follow up time. We report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery in nine patients with ten glomus tumors. All patients were treated either with frame based LINAC or Cyberknife with doses ranging from 1600 cGy to 2500 cGy. Three patients received no previous therapy and one patient received additional external beam radiation for concomitant treatment of carotid body tumors. Patients were then followed for post treatment side effects in addition to change in tumor size by MRI evaluation. The median clinical follow-up time was 26 months (mean 54 months), median radiographic follow-up was 21.5 months (mean 46 months), with a range from 3 to 126 months. The results from our center demonstrated nine of ten tumors to be stable in size by MRI exam, and one tumor which regressed in size. Nine patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one patient experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. Our results continue to support radiosurgery as a suitable form of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors as evidenced by results from this four and a half year follow-up

Eighty-two percent of the patients had widespread metastatic disease, and the mean tumor burden was 2,900 cc. Seventy-nine percent of the patients received concurrent radiotherapy. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain within the AA aperture (43%), systemic stress (43%), and nausea or vomiting (29%). Systemic stress was the most frequent power-limiting factor (46%). There were two treatment-related complications: sciatic neuritis from intramuscular injection (one) and pleural effusion from thermometry probe placement (one). Detailed thermal mapping and thermal dosimetry were performed on 26 patients. The mean thermal dosimetry parameters were quite low. Concurrent radiation doses were also quite low (mean, 1,500 rad) to avoid toxicity of sensitive organ systems within the abdomen. The objective response rate was only 18%, all partial, but 43% of the patients achieved effective symptomatic palliation. The five objective responders did survive significantly (P = .02) longer than the 23 nonresponders

In all patients N-acetyl-aspartate signals were decreased in tumour areas compared to the normal brain hemisphere. No recovery was seen after radiotherapy. Choline signals were increased in tumour margins of high grade gliomas and more diffusely in low grade gliomas. In 5 patients the choline resonance decreased after radiotherapy, accompanied by a shrinkage of tumour diameter on MRI. Lactate signals were present in high grade and unspecified astrocytomas and absent in most low grade gliomas. In 3 patients the lactate signal disappeared after radiotherapy. These observations indicate the feasibility of 1H-MRS in monitoring metabolic responses on radiotherapy of brain gliomas

The mean age of patients was 37 years, the male/female ratio 1:1.1. The most frequent complaints were diplopia with oculomotor disorders (51%), headache (31%), and decreased hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus with statoacusticus dysfunction (21%). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 27 months. The chondrosarcomas were located in the petrosal bone in 37% (47 cases), in the occipital bone and clivus in 23% (30 cases), in the sphenoid bone in 20% (25 cases) and to a lesser extent in frontal, ethmoidal, and parietal bones (14%). In 6% (eight cases) the primary location was in dural tissue. Radiological examinations showed bone destruction and variable calcification (CT), involvement of neuronal and vascular structures (MRI), and mostly hypovascularity on angiography. On histological examination 51% of tumours were classified as grade I, 11% grade II, 30% mesenchymal, and 8% myxoid. The mesenchymal type was the most malignant as illustrated by a strong tendency to intradural and cerebral growth and possibly occurrence in younger age groups. The treatment of choice until recently was surgery because of the critical location and local aggressive nature. Regrowth of tumour after surgery occurred in 53% of the patients (average after 32 months). Charged particle irradiation gave a five year survival of 83-94% and a local control rate of 78%-91%. Both in surgery and radiotherapy there is treatment related morbidity and mortality that should be considered when offering these therapies. Recent promising results imply that charged particle radiotherapy, in combination with surgery, may be the therapeutical choice of the future. [References: 46]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We followed 11 patients receiving an exclusive external radiation therapy for brain tumor for 8 months. They underwent proton MRS scans before any radiation exposure and 1, 4, and 8 months after they began the radiation therapy. The patients received 60 Gy in tumoral area fractionated over 6 weeks. The contralateral normal brain hemisphere received a radiation dose from 20 to 50 Gy. The main metabolite concentrations (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were evaluated by the areas of the peaks after peak fitting. Normalized values (NV) were obtained by processing the ratio of the peak area of a given metabolite to the sum of all the spectrum peak areas; ratios (NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr) were processed. One patient, who received panencephalic radiotherapy (30 Gy) after metastasectomy from a primary kidney adenocarcinoma, has been monitored with 1H-MRS eight times for 6 months to observe the onset of the metabolic changes. RESULTS: Changes were observed in irradiated normal brain tissue 4 months after radiation therapy began: the NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios and the NAA (NV) decreased while the Choline (NV) increased. Four months later, normal values were recovered. CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS has the potentiality to detect and to evaluate in vivo early adverse metabolic effects of radiation therapy in the normal human brain. These changes are significant 4 months after the radiation therapy began and appear to resolve over time

Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent complication, which resolved in all except 4 patients. Survival at 8 years was 52%, with 14% relapse-free survival. Patients with nodular histology had a more favorable prognosis than those with diffuse histology (median relapse-free survival of 24 vs. 12 months). There were 2 cases of erythroleukemia, which occurred after combination chemotherapy was given for relapse. Though TBI can offer complete remission and extended survival in advanced NHL, most patients eventually relapse and it should not be considered as a curative mode of therapy

METHODS: The authors prospectively studied helium-ion irradiation and iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy in a randomized, dynamically balanced trial. Of the 184 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 86 were treated with helium ions and 98 with 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: No patients with uveal melanoma had a history of systemic malignancy. Tumors were less than 15 mm in maximum diameter and less than 10 mm in thickness. A minimum tumor dose of 70 GyE was delivered to the tumor apex. There was a significantly higher local recurrence rate after 125I brachytherapy than after helium-ion irradiation. Enucleations occurred more frequently after brachytherapy (relative risk = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-5.78). More anterior segment complications occurred after helium-ion irradiation. To date, there has been no measurable impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: Most uveal melanomas can be managed with radiation with retention of the eye. There was better tumor control with helium-ion irradiation; however, there were more anterior segment complications

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1994 and January 1997, 36 patients with locally advanced, histologically proven, and new or recurrent cancer of the head and neck were treated with carbon ions. A dose escalation study was conducted, delivering 18 fractions through 6 weeks for 17 patients (Group A) and 16 fractions through 4 weeks for 19 patients (Group B). Eligibility and ineligibility criteria were the same in both groups. The dosages were escalated in increments of 10% after careful observation of at least 3 patients treated with the same dosages. The endpoints of the study were a Grade 3 reaction of the skin and the mucous membrane or local control of the tumors. RESULTS: Follow-up time ranged from 77 to 108 months with a median of 90 months. Grade 3 acute reaction of the skin was detected in 1 of the 2 patients in Group A who were treated with 70.2 GyE/18 fractions/6 weeks. In Group B, Grade 3 acute skin reaction was detected in 20% (1/5), 27% (2/11), and 67% (2/3) patients treated with 52.8 GyE, 57.6 GyE, and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks, respectively. There was only 1 patient with a Grade 3 acute reaction of the mucous membrane. Only 1 patient developed a Grade 2 late reaction of the mucous membrane (superficial ulcer), which was located close to the tumor. No other Grade 2 or greater late reaction was noted until the time of analysis. Acute tumor reactions in 34 patients consisted of 10 patients of complete response 19 of partial response, 4 of no change, and 1 of progressive disease. Local control of 34 patients calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 5 years. Five years' local control of five malignant melanomas showed 100%, and that of 9 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma was 90%. Also, local control of 8 patients of salivary glands and 4 patients of ears was 100% at 56 months and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The dose fractionation methods of 70.2 GyE through 18 fractions for 6 weeks and 64.0 GyE through 16 fractions for 4 weeks showed equal clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and local control. The outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy showed a specific effectiveness in local control of non-squamous cell carcinoma such as adenoid cystic carcinomas and malignant melanomas. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that carbon ion radiotherapy will deliver a high local control rate without unacceptable injuries to the surrounding normal tissues	
1	2972	Radiation maculopathy after proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Color, Eye, Female, Fluorescein Angiography, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Macula Lutea/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Photography, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Research, Retinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Retinal Vessels/re [Radiation Effects], Vision, Visual Acuity, Visual Acuity/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: Radiation maculopathy is a microangiopathy of the retina, which is often observed after irradiation of the eye. To quantitatively determine the frequency of anatomic and functional features of this condition, the authors reviewed a large series of patients with choroidal melanomas who were treated by proton beam irradiation. METHODS: Color photographs and/or fluorescein angiograms of 218 patients with paramacular choroidal melanomas were graded by two independent masked readers to determine the frequency of the various lesions of radiation maculopathy. RESULTS: Overall, 194 (89%) of the 218 patients in this study developed some degree of radiation maculopathy. The earliest and most common finding was macular edema, which was observed in 87% of patients, overall, by the end of year 3. Microvascular changes (microaneurysms and/or telangiectasia), intraretinal hemorrhages, and capillary nonperfusion were noted in 76%, 70%, and 64% of eyes, respectively, by the end of postirradiation year 3. Visual acuity was retained at 20/200 or better in 90% of eyes 1 year after irradiation and in 67% of eyes 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiation maculopathy is common after proton beam irradiation of paramacular choroidal melanomas. However, ambulatory vision is preserved in many eyes

The prognosis of unresectable/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma remains very poor because the rarity of the tumor has made it difficult to establish treatment guidelines, and diagnosis and the resultant treatment can be greatly delayed. We treated a 24-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma of the right adrenal gland which extended to the inferior vena cava. Although she underwent surgical resection of the extensive tumor as the primary treatment, the disease recurred in the lung and liver as multiple metastases shortly after surgery. She received intensive multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP regimen), embolization of the feeding arteries, and proton irradiation for the liver mass. Finally, she underwent reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA 1-locus-mismatched sibling donor. A prolonged survival of 39 months after the onset of the disease was achieved. Although this experience is limited, we suggest that TIP chemotherapy was effective for adrenocortical carcinoma, and a graft-versus-tumor effect after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation may have contributed to the prolonged survival

[German]	Biopsy, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/pa [Pathology], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/su [Surgery], Combined Modality Therapy, Ethmoid Sinus, Ethmoid Sinus/pa [Pathology], Ethmoid Sinus/re [Radiation Effects], Ethmoid Sinus/su [Surgery], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Head, Humans, Imaging,Three-Dimensional, Incidence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Invasiveness/pa [Pathology], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Radiation Injuries/et [Etiology], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Adjuvant, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	Primary tumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare entities which, because of precarious localization and frequently diffuse propagation into neighbouring cavities and the skull base, pose a significant therapeutic problem. Even after complete surgical resection, local relapses are frequent. Postoperative radiotherapy is therefore usually indicated. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a new technique that helps creating dose distributions that conform closely to the target volume while maximally sparing the organs at risk. This results in the possibility of applying escalated doses to the target while still keeping the incidence of side effects low. What is especially appealing is the possibility of shaping the dose distribution within the target in such a way that areas with a presumably high tumor cell load receive increased doses, a concept which is best described by the term "integrated boost". We present the case of a patient with a sinunasal carcinoma and describe the implications of the clinical implementation of this technique	
1	2952	Mixed beam radiation therapy for unresectable squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck: the results of a randomized RTOG study	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Clinical Trials as Topic, Fast Neutrons, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Head, Head and Neck Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Larynx, Male, Middle Aged, Neck, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Random Allocation, Survival	Three hundred and twenty-two patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were entered on a randomized study comparing "mixed beam" radiation therapy with photon radiation therapy. Patients with histologically proven tumors of T-stage T2, T3, or T4 and any N-stage originating in the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were eligible. One hundred forty-five patients were randomized to photon treatment and 177 were randomized to mixed beam treatment. No significant differences could be demonstrated between the experimental and control groups for primary tumor control or overall survival, although there was an advantage for mixed beam treatment over photon treatment for patients with metastatic cervical adenopathy (69 vs. 55% complete response rate in the nodes, p = .024). It is concluded that mixed beam radiation therapy does not offer a significant advantage over photon radiation therapy for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck	
0	3433	Whole abdominal irradiation for tumors of the uterine corpus	Abdomen, Boston, Combined Modality Therapy, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hysterectomy, Lymphatic Metastasis, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/mo [Mortality], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Postoperative Care, Prognosis, Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Risk, Sarcoma, Survival, Survivors, Uterine Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	Between November 1981 and December 1985, 16 patients with high-risk tumors of the uterine corpus were treated with a postoperative course of whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation. Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy	
1	2112	Value and perspectives of proton radiation therapy for limited stage prostate cancer	Dose Fractionation, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Staging, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Survival, Survival Rate, Time, Time Factors, Universities	BACKGROUND: This review article will focus on clinical results and limitations of proton beam irradiation. Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone	
1	924	Influence of patient age on biochemical freedom from disease in patients undergoing conformal proton radiotherapy of organ-confined prostate cancer	Adenocarcinoma/mo [Mortality], Adenocarcinoma/pa [Pathology], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged,80 and over, California, Disease-Free Survival, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Life Tables, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Survival, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome	OBJECTIVES: To examine a large, single-institution series of patients to test the perception among clinicians that radiotherapy is preferred for "older" patients and surgery should be indicated for "younger" men. Both radiotherapy and surgery are used to control prostate cancer, and both yield similar results in terms of long-term biochemical disease-free (bNED) survival. METHODS: The bNED survival results from more than 1000 patients treated solely with conformal radiotherapy were analyzed to determine whether a difference in outcome supervened for patients younger than 60 years of age versus older patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bNED survival was found, in terms of patient age. Statistically significant predictors of outcome included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage at diagnosis, and Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age younger than 60 years versus older than 60 years at treatment did not influence bNED survival significantly. Patient age at treatment should not be used in and of itself to recommend one type of treatment over another

CASES: Using 123I-IMP SPECT, we observed three patients over a period of 18 months in whom choroidal melanoma had been diagnosed. Two underwent radiotherapy (cyber knife) in our clinic; the other patient was referred to us after 8 months of proton beam irradiation at another clinic. OBSERVATIONS: In two of the three cases, no metastasis or tumor recurrence has been observed up to the present time. In these individuals, the average 123I-IMP uptake in the pathological eye gradually and progressively decreased after radiotherapy to levels seen in the fellow eye. One eye of the three patients examined here, however, exhibited tumor recurrence in the ciliary body as well as hepatic metastasis 12 months after radiation treatment. In the pathological eye of this patient, the average 123I-IMP uptake gradually decreased, but never reached the levels in the fellow eye during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: 123I-IMP SPECT is a useful examination method not only for diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients with choroidal melanoma

Protons have favorable physical characteristics which allow the delivery of high doses of radiation to these critically located tumors. The methods employed for these treatments are described. These patients have been followed for at least 17 months and for a median of 34 months. The median tumor dose was 69 CGE (cobalt Gy equivalent): CGE is the dose in proton Gy multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons compared to cobalt-60. The daily dose was 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. For this group the 5-year actuarial local control rate is 82% and disease-free survival rate is 76%. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity has been acceptable

[German]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Child, Female, Head, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Stereotaxic Techniques	Since 1982 79 patients with intracranial AVM's were irradiated at linear accelerator with 10 MV photons. Diagnosis, localization and therapy were done immobilizing the head for identical positioning. In a controlled study the therapy was done with fractionated irradiation up to 50 Gy in 25 fractions within 5 weeks or with 20 Gy in 4 fractions within 7 days. Complications, due to therapy, did not occur. Suffering from convulsion was not affected. Five patients have died, one patient got a hemorrhage 36 months later. The angiographical analysis of the first 25 patients until 30 months after radiotherapy gave complete obliterations and reduction of volume in more than 50% with minor AVM's. The result are not detrimental compared with a group after photon irradiation

DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects	
1	2468	[Experience in the treatment of eye tumors using a narrow medical proton beam]. [Russian]	Adult, Eye, Eye Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Mortality, Physics, Protons, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods]	This paper presents the effects of proton beam therapy of 175 patients with tumors of the eye. Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. With 1H-MRS imaging, high choline with low citrate signal was observed in the prostate, and in the lymph node a signal of choline-containing compounds was identified. The tissue level of the compounds in the enlarged lymph node was estimated to be 8.1 mmol/kg water. Subsequent histopathological analysis of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and computed tomography-guided biopsy of the lymph node confirmed the presence of prostate cancer in both

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 3,561 patients who underwent conformal radiation for prostate cancer. Therapy consisted of proton irradiation of the prostate and seminal vesicles and X-ray treatment of the pelvis when warranted. The number of treatments in which the balloon was tolerated was recorded. Results were stratified according to method of irradiation (protons alone vs. combined proton/X-ray) and method of planning (2D vs. 3D planning of X-ray fields in patients undergoing combination treatment). RESULTS: Of all the patients evaluated, 3,474 (97.6%) tolerated the balloon throughout treatment; 87 (2.4%) declined the balloon for 1 or more treatments and tolerated the balloon for 85.5% of their treatments. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant tolerance advantage in those who received protons alone compared with combination treatment (99.5% vs. 95.7%; p < 0.001). In patients undergoing combination treatment, chi-square analysis did not reveal significant tolerance differences in patients undergoing 3D vs. 2D planning for pelvic X-ray fields (95.74% vs. 95.72%; p = 0.990). CONCLUSIONS: Intrarectal balloons are well tolerated over a course of conformal prostate irradiation

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and September 2005, 54 patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors after surgery. Median total dose was 60 CGE (weekly fractionation 7 x 3.0 CGE). All patients were followed prospectively in regular intervals after treatment. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-84 months). Only 2 patients developed local recurrences. The actuarial local control rates were 96.2% and 89.8% at 3 and 4 years; overall survival was 98.2%at 5 years. Only 1 patient developed a mucositis CTCAE Grade 3; the remaining patients did not develop any acute toxicities >CTCAE Grade 2. Five patients developed minor late toxicities (RTOG/EORTC Grades 1-2), including bilateral cataract (n = 1), sensory hearing loss (n = 1), a reduction of growth hormone (n = 1), and asymptomatic radiation-induced white matter changes of the adjacent temporal lobe (n = 2). Grade 3 late toxicity occurred in 1 patient (1.9%) only. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT is an effective treatment for low- and intermediate-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base offering high local control rates with low toxicity

Surgical excision is often attempted after embolization. Interventional neuro-radiology is available in only a few centers. If large AVMs can be safely excised without pre-operative embolizaton, then these lesions can be treated at many neurosurgical centers. METHODS: Between January 1986 and June 1992, a total of 210 patients with cerebral AVMs were diagnosed by angiographic studies. Twenty-seven of them had large AVMs wider than 5 cm in the longest diameter. The case records of these patients were retrieved and studied. RESULTS: Two patients were treated with Bragg peak proton beam therapy. Twelve patients were treated conservatively with no improvement. Thirteen patients underwent surgery and total AVM excision was achieved in 11. None of the patients who underwent surgery had any pre- or intra-operative embolization. All the patients had no neurological deterioration post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS: Large cerebral AVMs can be treated by surgical excision alone with acceptable results

However, psychological distress and anxiety related to irradiation are often observed. Purpose of our study was the evaluation of the influence of radiotherapy-induced distress in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and June 1996 in 48 breast cancer patients (31 to 76 years old) treated by breast-conserving surgery adjuvant irradiation with or without systemic therapy was applied. On the first and the last day of radiotherapy they were given a questionnaire (Table 1) which was designed together with psychologists. Covering different situations related to radiotherapy the construction of items are determined by factors with possible influence on psychological distress and perception with regard to irradiation. RESULTS: Most of the women (92%) stated to be well informed about the irradiation and tried to obtain further information about this treatment (83%). 56% tried not to think about radiotherapy and/or to distract themselves (81%). 40% were anxious about the fact to undergo irradiation. In the end of treatment 77% reported to have been anxious only initially or never; only 19% were anxious almost or most of the time. 35% were worried about the expected cosmetic alterations of their breast; only 30% observed acute cosmetic changes. With regard to situation-related distress all patients (100%) stated that the communication with the medical staff made it easier to stand the irradiation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of theoretical considerations our results are explorative in character. However, following statements seem to be important: 1. A large requirement exists to get information about radiotherapy. 2. The patients experience irradiation treatment more positive than initially expected by themselves. 3. With regard to radiotherapy anxiety is reduced during the course of treatment. Here the psychosocial care of the medical staff is an important support for reduction of anxiety

In all cases enlargement of the lesion and increase of the perilesional edema were demonstrated by MRI on average 10.6+/-2.6 months after initial treatment. Radiation-induced necrosis was identified in 5 patients (histologically in 2, clinically in 3). In one of these a false positive result of FDG PET was observed, whereas data of proton MRS were always correct. The diagnosis of tumor recurrence was established in 4 patients (histologically in 3, clinically in 1). Among these both FDG PET and single-voxel proton MRS showed false negative results (each method twice), whereas multi-voxel proton MRS always permitted us to establish the correct diagnosis. The present study demonstrates the higher diagnostic accuracy of multi-voxel proton MRS, in comparison with single-voxel proton MRS and FDG PET, for the differentiation of the radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. Its use is especially important in mixed lesions with co-existence of both post-irradiation changes and viable neoplasm. Monitoring of the treatment response by serial multi-voxel proton MRS seems to be reasonable during follow-up of patients with brain metastases after radiosurgery	
1	1096	Simultaneous minimizing monitor units and number of segments without leaf end abutment for segmental intensity modulated radiation therapy delivery	Algorithms, Humans, Models,Theoretical, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Time Factors	Leaf end abutment is seldom studied when delivering segmental intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields. We developed an efficient leaf sequencing method to eliminate leaf end abutment for segmental IMRT delivery. Our method uses simple matrix and sorting operations to obtain a solution that simultaneously minimizes total monitor units and number of segments without leaf end abutment between segments. We implemented and demonstrated our method for multiple clinical cases. We compared the results of our method with the results from exhaustive search method. We found that our solution without leaf end abutment produced equivalent results to the unconstrained solutions in terms of minimum total monitor units and minimum number of leaf segments. We conclude that the leaf end abutment fields can be avoided without affecting the efficiency of segmental IMRT delivery. The major strength of our method is its simplicity and high computing speed. This potentially provides a useful means for generating segmental IMRT fields that require high spatial resolution or complex intensity distributions

We have studied the severe complications occurring after treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. Four groups of patients were compared: Group 1 (80 patients) had treatment with surgery alone for mobile and resectable tumors; Group 2 (23 patients) had treatment with high dose preoperative irradiation followed by surgical resection for tumors which were fixed to adjacent structures and initially unresectable for cure; Group 3 (24 patients, primary disease) and Group 4 (17 patients, locally recurrent disease) had locally advanced tumors as in Group 2 but were treated with IORT after preoperative irradiation and attempted surgical resection. All but 3 complications occurred within one year of therapy. Severe complications were seen in 16% of patients in Group 1, 35% in Group 2, 21% in Group 3 and 47% in Group 4 (32% in Groups 3 and 4 combined). There was a statistically insignificant increase (p = .10) in the complication rate in all irradiated patients (locally advanced tumors) compared to surgery alone (clinically mobile tumors). These data indicate no increase in severe complications with the use of IORT. If the ongoing studies continue to show improved local control with the use of IORT, expanded use of this modality may be warranted

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

A 76-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma on January 17, 2002. She received five courses of sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate-5-fluorouracil after the surgical resection. A metastatic liver tumor was detected in the caudate lobe of the liver by computed tomography at 6 months after the surgical resection. We employed concurrent proton beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy which consisted of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/body per day, as a 24-h intravenous injection for 4 weeks) and low dose cisplatin (10 mg/body on days 1-5 every week for 4 weeks). Proton beam therapy targeting the metastatic liver tumor was performed in a daily fraction of 3 Gy, 5 days per week, with a total dose of 66 Gy over 30 days. The tumor disappeared 3 months after the treatment and no recurrence has been observed for 2 years after termination of the treatment. Throughout the entire course of treatment, the patient received injections of granulocyte stimulating factor subcutaneously for grade 3 leukopenia. She never complained of abdominal symptoms, such as epigastralgia, nausea or diarrhea. Liver failure related to proton irradiation has not been observed. This concurrent proton beam radiotherapy with systemic chemotherapy could be an effective treatment modality for metastatic liver tumor from gastric carcinoma

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, 175 patients received C-ion RT using a recommended dose fractionation (66.0 GyE/20 fractions) established from prior studies. C-ion RT alone was performed for 33 patients constituting a low-risk group (Stage < or =T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml and Gleason score < or =6); the remaining 142 high-risk patients received an additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and bNED rates were 91% and 87%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all but one patient. The 4-year bNED rates were 87% in the low-risk group and 88% in the high-risk group. In very advanced diseases (Stage > or= T3a or PSA > or= 20 ng/ml or Gleason score > or =8), there was significant difference in the bNED rate according to period of ADT administration (ADT > or =24 months: 93%, ADT <24 months: 73%, p<0.01). Grade 2 late toxicities developed in 4 patients (2%) for the rectum and 9 patients (5%) for the genitourinary system but no Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of C-ion RT for prostate cancer has been well confirmed. Based on these results, new study of a C-ion RT modified for the administration strategy of ADT according to the patient risk has been started by dividing patients into 3 groups, high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk	
1	2974	Neurovisual outcome following proton radiation therapy	Adult, Boston, Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Color, Eye, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Optic Chiasm, Optic Chiasm/re [Radiation Effects], Optic Nerve/re [Radiation Effects], Protons, Radiation, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Visual Acuity	From February 1981 to January 1984, 20 patients with a tumor of the upper clivus received proton irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended

[French]	Humans, Particle Accelerators, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiosurgery/td [Trends], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted	We began intracranial stereotactic irradiation under the direction of O Betti 11 years ago. At the present time, we believe it is interesting to present the methodologies of the SALT (Saint-Anne-Lariboisiere-Tenon) group. Up to the present time we have irradiated 693 patients using a single fraction. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represented the majority (90%) of treated lesions. Irradiation protocol has little changed since 1986, and the localization of the target volume was performed in the neurosurgery department of St Anne Hospital, France. The stereotactic images (computerized tomography [CT], angiography) were sent to the radiotherapy department of Tenon Hospital through the French public digital network NUMERIS. Protocol was realized using the stereotactic ARTEMIS-3D/Dosigray TPS. The lesion volume was filled by one or more spherical or elliptical subvolumes using the "Associated Target Methodology". The interactive adjustment of subvolumes was based on the 3D graphical representations of the lesion. The direct optimization of the irradiation space was performed by managing parameters provided by the DDB (Dosimetric Data Base) such as the number of arcs, their angular position, as well as the starting and the ending point of each arc. The evaluation of the calculated dose distribution was made using quantitative parameters. The second method of optimization was based on the minibeam intensity modulation using a mathematical theory of inverse problems and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. At the present time, due to technical reasons, linear accelerators do not permit the modulation of intensity of arctherapy. Thus we transformed the profiles of irregular forms into rectangular profiles of modulated ponderation, with each optimized plan being evaluated before its implementation. The criteria of evaluation were derived from the differential and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH). The DVHs permitted the evaluation of the volumes of underdosage and overdosage inside the lesion and in the healthy tissue, respectively. Using DVHs, we have defined parameters such as the conform factor and the homogeneity index. We stress that the methodology of protocol optimization is valid for single or multiple fractions as well as for intra- and extra-cranial irradiation

The time between start of helium ion treatment and recognition of metastatic disease ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 27 months). The mean pretreatment tumor height in the patients with metastases was 7.7 mm. All 42 patients who developed metastatic disease have died. The median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease was 5 months; the longest survival was 49 months. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (n = 34). Four (10%) of the 42 patients with metastases also had local recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis identified three variables that predicted independently the development of metastases and lack of survival. These variables are anterior location of tumor (P = .027), tumor height greater than 5 mm (P = .02), and tumor diameter greater than 10 mm (P = .0075)

We have developed a dynamic intravenous coronary angiography (IVCAG) system using synchrotron radiation (SR) and have used it clinically. Four patients suspected of having angina pectoris underwent IVCAG. An SR beam was reflected asymmetrically with a silicon crystal to produce a wide (150 mm x 80 mm) and monochromatic (37 keV) X-ray beam, with an energy level to achieve high sensitivity to the contrast agent. Following an intravenous injection of contrast agent, irradiation was applied for 4 ms periods at 33 ms intervals for dynamic IVCAG at 30 images s-1. Images were acquired with an image intensifier and recorded with a digital fluorography system. The dynamic images permitted clear visualization of the coronary arteries and permitted evaluation of coronary anatomy. Two patients exhibited no stenotic lesions, one patient had a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and the remaining patient had a 25% stenosis at the site of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The total irradiation doses used for IVCAG were less than those for conventional angiography. Dynamic IVCAG can be readily used for the evaluation of coronary arteries

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing	
1	3370	A comparison of proton and megavoltage X-ray treatment planning for prostate cancer	Humans, Male, Patient Selection, Physics, Probability, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectum, Research, X-Ray Therapy	Conformal photon and proton therapy plans for prostate cancer have been compared in an attempt to quantify the potential advantages of using protons. Two X-ray plans (3-field, 6-field) and a 2-field proton plan were made and compared for each of 20 T3 prostate patients with the aid of the 3D planning system VOXELPLAN. Dose distributions were analysed in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVH). Tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were computed using our own and the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models, respectively. The study shows that on average the proton technique results in the best dose distribution, giving the lowest rectal complication probability, and also that the 3-field X-ray technique is more effective than the 6-field X-ray technique in sparing the rectum. At 5% rectal NTCP, the predicted proton average TCP for the 20 patients is 2% (in absolute terms) greater than that obtained using 3-field X-ray therapy. For 7 of the patients the gain in TCP is more than 3%. For the same rectal NTCP as the 3-field X-ray plan with a 64 Gy mean target dose, the use of protons increases the TCP by 2% on average, but for 5 of the patients the increases are greater than 4%. The result is in general positive towards the use of protons but a few patients do not benefit from it and this indicates the importance of patient selection for maximum clinical benefit

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1994 and February 2002, 48 patients with histologically confirmed malignant gliomas (16 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 32 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical study. The treatment involved the application of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks of XRT, followed by CRT at 8 fractions/2 weeks. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) were administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) concurrently in weeks 1, 4, or 5 of XRT. The carbon ion dose was increased from 16.8 to 24.8 Gray equivalent (GyE) in 10% incremental steps (16.8, 18.4, 20.0, 22.4, and 24.8 GyE, respectively). RESULTS: There was no Grade 3 or higher acute reaction in the brain. The late reactions included four cases of Grade 2 brain morbidity and four cases of Grade 2 brain reaction among 48 cases. The median survival time (MST) of AA patients was 35 months and that of GBM patients 17 months (p = 0.0035). The median progression-free survival and MST of GBM showed 4 and 7 months for the low-dose group, 7 and 19 months for the middle-dose group, and 14 and 26 months for the high-dose group. CONCLUSION: The results of combined therapy using XRT, ACNU chemotherapy, and CRT showed the potential efficacy of CRT for malignant gliomas in terms of the improved survival rate in those patients who received higher carbon doses

Currently published studies use IMRT only in the treatment of the primary tumor. In these studies, the lymph nodes of the neck were treated using conventional techniques. The feasibility of an IMRT technique which allows treatment of the complete target volume, including the primary tumor and lymph nodes, without a beam split is described. PATIENT AND METHOD: For inverse treatment planning, the KonRad planning system was used. The primary as well as the secondary PTV (bilateral lymph node levels) were treated with one intensity-modulated primary plan. To increase the dose in the primary PTV and suspicious lymph nodes, an intensity-modulated boost plan was performed. The "step and shoot" IMRT technique was used. A plan comparison between the described IMRT approach and an IMRT approach using a split-beam technique was performed focusing on the treatment time. A patient with a carcinoma of the nasopharynx was treated with curative intent by a combined radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: The median total dose to the primary PTV was 70 Gy, to suspicious lymph nodes > or = 66.0 Gy, and to the secondary PTV 52 Gy. The defined maximum doses to the organs at risk were not exceeded, and the median dose to the protected parotid gland amounted to 21 Gy. Comparison of the treatment time between both IMRT approaches revealed only a slightly shorter treatment time (1-3 min) for the split-beam IMRT technique without considering the remaining conventional treatment parts of the split-beam IMRT technique. The patient achieved a complete response, and 18 months after treatment no signs of recurrent disease are visible. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT allows the treatment of the target volumes with high doses combined with an excellent sparing of the organs at risk. The IMRT approach presented here makes the treatment of the whole target volume with a single-beam arrangement feasible and does not increase the treatment time compared to a split-beam IMRT technique. Treatment time was comparable to a conventional three-field technique combined with electrons. This IMRT technique can prevent over- or underdosage at field matchlines in the head and neck region and, moreover, is able to spare parotid glands and therefore better avoid xerostomia compared to conventional techniques	
0	1634	A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.[see comment]	Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Head, Humans, Laryngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Quality of Life, Radiation Injuries/pc [Prevention & Control], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Switzerland, Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this work, the potential benefits and limitations of different treatment techniques, based on mixed photon-electron beams, 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photons (IM) and protons (passively scattered and spot scanned), have been assessed using comparative treatment planning methods in a cohort of patients presenting with advanced head and neck tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plans for five patients were computed for all modalities using CT scans to delineate target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and to predict dose distributions. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 54 Gy, whilst the spinal cord was constrained to a maximum dose of 40.5 Gy for all techniques. Dose volume histograms were used for physical and biological evaluation, which included equivalent uniform dose (EUD) calculations. RESULTS: Excluding the mixed photon-electron technique, PTV coverage was within the defined limits for all techniques, with protons providing significantly improved dose homogeneity, resulting in correspondingly higher EUD results. For the spinal cord, protons also provided the best sparing with maximum doses as low as 17 Gy. Whilst the IM plans were demonstrated to be significantly superior to non-modulated photon plans, they were found to be inferior to protons for both criteria. A similar result was found for the parotid glands. Although they are partially included in the treated volume there is a clear indication that protons, and to a lesser extent IM photons, could play an important role in preserving organ functionality with a consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: For advanced head and neck tumours, we have demonstrated that the use of IM photons or protons both have the potential to reduce the possibility of spinal cord toxicity. In addition, a substantial reduction of dose to the parotid glands through the use of protons enhances the interest for such a treatment modality in cases of advanced head and neck tumours. However, in terms of target coverage, the use of 3D conformal therapy, although somewhat inferior in quality to protons or IM photons, has been shown to be a reasonable alternative to the more advanced techniques. In contrast, the conventional technique of mixed photon and electron fields has been shown to be inferior to all other techniques for both target coverage and OAR involvement

To establish heavy ion therapy for prostate cancer, three trials have been conducted. For 247 patients with T1b-T3 cancer, carbon ion beam was irradiated 20 times/5 weeks with or without endocrine therapy. Overall and cause-specific survivals were excellent and local control was achieved in all patients except one. Grade 3 late morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra was developed in 7 cases who received higher dose. Thus, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment. In conclusion, carbon ion therapy is expected to exert excellent effect in the treatment of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. [References: 19]

We present a case report that appears to contradict this doctrine. The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and was treated with surgical resection and postoperative proton-beam radiation therapy. Approximately 16 mo after completion of therapy, MRI demonstrated two new regions of enhancement, and an FDG-PET study was performed to further characterize these lesions. FDG-PET demonstrated an area of intense hypermetabolism, and wide surgical resection was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed reactive changes and areas of necrosis. There was no evidence of either recurrent or radiation-induced tumor

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma

All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma. Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation. The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed

METHODS: 54 patients after with malignant brain tumor (44 cases of glioblastoma, 10 other high-grade gliomas) were examined post-surgically in a total of 140 proton MRS examinations in the course of radiotherapy and in follow-up controls. Fast SI acquisition was performed as single-slice or double-slice TSI sequence with 32 x 32 phase encodings within 11 or 15 minutes, respectively. SVS with TR/TE 2000/272 ms yielded relative metabolite ratios, and in 15 patients the time courses of the absolute concentrations of brain metabolites were also determined. RESULTS: In the group of 44 patients that could be tracked by MRS until therapy completion, TSI localized in 23 patients a persistent or newly arisen distinct choline accumulation indicating residual or recurrent tumor after radiation therapy. In all these cases MRS diagnosis was confirmed histologically or by short-term follow-up. However, in 6 of 15 patients showing a normal choline pattern in the TSI acquisition, tumor recurrence appeared within three months. SVS provided early recognition of recurrent tumor when detecting characteristic alterations of metabolite concentrations oin therapy follow-up. CONCLUSION: TSI and SVS represent complementary MRS techniques and are able to diagnose tumor recurrence early and unambiguously in cases where focal choline accumulation is detected

This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05). No definitive dose-response relationship for local control of tumor was seen, although the local control rate was 71% +/- 9% for 32 patients receiving doses > or =55 Gy vs. 53.6% +/- 20.1% for 9 patients receiving <55 Gy (p = 0.11). Of 15 patients with tumors >5.3 cm, 9 received doses > or =55 Gy and the local control rate was 80% +/- 17.9%, and 6 received doses <55 Gy with a local control rate of only 50% +/- 25% at 5 years (p = 0.16). Among patients who underwent gross total resection, the local control rate was 77.5% +/- 9.95% in 22 patients with negative margins vs 66.7% +/- 27.2% in 3 patients with positive margins (p = 0.54). Two patients had unknown margin status. CONCLUSION: RT can help provide local control of osteosarcoma for patients in whom surgical resection with widely, negative margins is not possible. It appears to be more effective in situations in which microscopic or minimal residual disease is being treated

Recently, both radical resection and charged-particle irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery have reportedly been found effective for tumor control and for promoting a better quality of life in patients. In this article the authors analyzed the outcomes in 17 patients with skull base chordomas who were surgically treated at Kobe University Hospital between 1972 and 2000. METHODS: Preoperative radiological examinations included magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, angiography, and balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery. Among the various surgical approaches used to remove the tumor were the frontoorbitozygomatic, transmaxillary, transcondylar, transsphenoidal, and the transbasal. Total removal was achieved in two (12%), near-total removal in three (18%), subtotal removal in nine (52%), and partial removal in three patients (18%). Since 1990, chordomas have been radically resected via various skull base approaches; the combined total or near-total removal rate has been 80% in this period. Radical removal of the tumors has not led to an increased risk. At the final follow-up review (mean 59.5 month), 75% of the patients were still alive, and 25% had died of chordoma recurrence. The overall recurrence-free survival rate was 82% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate in the five patients who underwent the operation during the past decade was 77% (mean follow up of 5.2 years). In two patients with recurrent tumors who underwent radiosurgery, no evidence of tumor regrowth was demonstrated at 3 years posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that for the treatment of skull base chordomas radical resection is a key factor for longer survival and improved quality of life. Patients with sufficiently small tumors, which show a favorable configuration and location, can be suitable candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery

N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR AMS. since 1983 using the synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. A "piercing" method with a proton beam of 12 mm in diameter (in one case 10 mm) was employed. Nine patients had unilateral anastomoses with the blood supply from branches of the internal and/or external carotid arteries, and one patient had a bilateral anastomosis. Irradiation was given in 2 fractions, in 2-3 days, the maximum total dose was 50-60 Gy. Regression of ophthalmological symptoms was noted 2-3 months after irradiation. Convalescence was noted in 8 patients, a follow-up period in 2 patients was insufficient. Of 7 patients examined by angiography complete thrombosis of the anastomosis was noted in 4, considerable reduction of the blood flow was noted in 3

In four cases in which detailed microscopic examinations were performed, radiation induced tumour necrosis was evident but in all four cases viable tumour cells were also observed. No abnormalities that could be attributed to radiation were observed in brain tissue free from tumour. The therapeutic results were comparable to the results achieved by other modern therapies. The results support the view that the RBE of high-energy protons is similar to that for 60Co radiation. It is suggested that a larger radiation dose, delivered by a homogeneous, well-defined proton field could possibly result in an improved therapeutic result without undue risk of injury to normal brain tissue	
1	2752	An evaluation of the influence of reproductive factors on the risk of metastases from uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Contraceptives,Oral, Environment, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Middle Aged, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/mo [Mortality], Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/pa [Pathology], Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Reproductive History, Risk, Risk Factors, Sex Factors, Survival Analysis, Women	BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data concerning the possible role played by hormonal factors in the risk of metastases from intraocular melanomas. METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma	
0	675	Proton beam radiotherapy versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: A comparative study	Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Dose Fractionation, Germany, Humans, Melanoma/ra [Radiography], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Risk, Switzerland, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Uveal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]	PURPOSE: A comparative treatment planning study was undertaken between proton and photon therapy in uveal melanoma to assess the potential benefits and limitations of these treatment modalities. A fixed proton horizontal beam (OPTIS) and intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT), with multiple noncoplanar beam arrangements, was compared with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), using a static and a dynamic micromultileaf collimator and intensity-modulated RT (IMRS). METHOD AND MATERIALS: A planning CT scan was performed on a brain metastasis patient, with a 3-mm acquisition slice spacing and the patient looking at a luminous spot with the eyes in three different positions (neutral and 25 degrees right and left). Four different gross tumor volumes were defined for each treatment technique. These target scenarios represented different locations (involving vs. not involving the macula and temporal vs. nasal) and volumes (10 x 6 mm vs. 16 x 10 mm) to challenge the proton and photon treatment techniques. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 2 mm laterally and 3 mm craniocaudally for both modalities. A dose homogeneity of 95-99% of the planning target volume was used as the "goal" for all techniques. The dose constraint (maximum) for the organs at risk (OARs) for both the proton and the SRT photon plans was 27.5, 22.5, 20, and 9 CGE-Gy for the optic apparatus, retina, lacrimal gland, and lens, respectively. The dose to the planning target volume was 50 CGE-Gy in 10 CGE-Gy daily fractions. The plans for proton and photon therapy were computed using the Paul Scherrer Institute and BrainSCAN, version 5.2 (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) treatment planning systems, respectively. Tumor and OARs dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using the dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index (CI(95%)), and inhomogeneity coefficient. RESULTS: Target coverage of all simulated uveal melanomas was equally conformal with the photon and proton modalities. The median CI(95%) value was 1.74, 1.86, and 1.83 for the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively. With proton planning, the median CI(95%) was 1.88 for OPTIS and substantially improved with IMPT in some tumor cases (median CI(95%), 1.29). The tumor dose homogeneity in the proton plans was, however, always better than with SRT photon planning (median inhomogeneity coefficient 0.1 and 0.15 vs. 0.46, 0.41, and 0.23 for the OPTIS and IMPT vs. the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans, respectively). Compared with the photon plans, the use of protons did not lead to a substantial reduction in the homolateral OAR total integral dose in the low- to high-dose level, except for the lacrimal gland. The median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume with the static, dynamic, and IMSRT plans was 33-30.8, 31.8-28, and 35.8-49 Gy, respectively, for the lacrimal gland, a critical organ. For protons, only the OPTIS plans were better, with a median maximal dose and dose at the 10% volume using OPTIS and IMPT of 19.2 and 8.8 and 25.6 and 23.6 CGE, respectively. The contralateral OARs were completely spared with the proton plans, but the median dose delivered to these structures was 1.2 Gy (range, 0-6.3 Gy) with the SRT photon plans. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of SRT photon techniques, compared with protons, can result in similar levels of dose conformation. IMPT did not increase the degree of conformality for this small tumor. Tumor dose inhomogeneity was, however, always increased with photon planning. Except for the lacrimal gland, the use of protons, with or without intensity modulation, did not increase homolateral OAR dose sparing. The dose to all the contralateral OARs was, however, completely eliminated with proton planning

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery

All patients were examined with standardized A and B scan ultrasonography before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation therapy. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 6-34 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 9 out of 10 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period.

1	1508	Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas: combined experience of the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre and the Princess Margaret Hospital	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cohort Studies, Disease Progression, Female, Hearing, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neurilemmoma/su [Surgery], Ontario, Particle Accelerators, Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Time Factors, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for vestibular schwannomas in patients treated at two university-affiliated hospitals. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-nine patients were treated between April 1996 and September 2000. The median age was 56 years (range: 29-80), and median maximal tumor diameter was 20 mm (range: 9-40). A total of 11 patients had fifth and/or seventh cranial nerve dysfunction before irradiation; 2 patients had only facial weakness, 5 patients had only facial numbness, and 4 patients had both facial weakness and numbness. Thirty-three patients were treated with primary FSRT, and 6 patients were treated for recurrent or persistent disease after previous surgery. All patients were treated with 6-MV photons using a stereotactic system with a relocatable frame. The 39 patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Median follow-up was 21.8 months (range: 4.4-49.6). RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 37 patients (95%). Two patients experienced deterioration of their symptoms at 3 and 20 months as a result of clinical progression in one case and tumor progression in the other and underwent surgery post FSRT. A total of 19/28 (67.9%) patients preserved serviceable hearing after FSRT. Deterioration of the facial and trigeminal nerves was observed in only 2 patients who were treated with surgery post FSRT. CONCLUSION: FSRT provided excellent tumor control with minimal morbidity and good hearing preservation in this cohort of patients. Longer follow-up is required to confirm long-term control rates

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients previously treated for a variety of irregularly shaped intracranial lesions using BrainLAB's micro-MLC were retrospectively replanned using the Varian Millennium MLC (5 mm leaf width). All planning was performed with the BrainSCAN v 5.1 software. The same fixed, noncoplanar beam arrangement was used for both plans, and identical target coverage was achieved by adjusting the MLC shape around the planning target volume (PTV). The isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were computed and plans were compared in terms of conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV and dose received by surrounding normal tissue. RESULTS: Equivalent PTV coverage was achieved using the 5-mm collimator by adjusting the MLC shape around the target in every case. There was a statistically significant increase in the conformity index for the Varian MLC compared with the micro-MLC (p < 0.001), indicating a worse conformity of the prescription isodose to the PTV, but this parameter was within our (and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) clinical criterion in all cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to critical structures, but DVH curves demonstrated an increased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower isodose levels. The mean increase in the volume of critical structure enclosed within the 50% and 70% isodose surfaces was 5.7% and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The micro-MLC consistently improves both PTV conformity and surrounding tissue sparing when compared to that of a standard linear accelerator. However, when viewed quantitatively, the improvements are small enough that individual centers may question their choice of equipment when outfitting a stereotactic radiotherapy service

Longterm follow-up after conventional high voltage radiation in 17 patients and proton therapy in 13 patients confirmed a similar reduction of GH levels in both groups. After 4.5 years a decrease of about 80% was achieved. After "conventional radiation" GH was normal in 8 (47%) and near normal in 6 (35%) while proton therapy resulted in normalization in 5 and improvement in 5 (38%). The slightly better results of "conventional radiation" must be attributed to lower pretreatment levels of GH. Side effects as additional pituitary deficits and oculomotor palsies were more often seen after proton treatment. Since the results of both radiation methods are similar and proton therapy has a tendency to more serious side effects we recommend "conventional radiation" as secondary treatment of acromegaly

METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 6 patients (7 eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and choroidal hemangiomas were reviewed. An exudative retinal detachment was the indication for treatment in all cases. The mean age of the 6 patients was 13 years (range, 4 to 20 years). The minimum follow-up time was 1 year. Patients were checked for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. The patients were treated with radiotherapy. A total dose of 20 Grays was applied to 7 eyes: 2 with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma underwent proton therapy and 5 with diffuse hemangioma were treated by external beam irradiation. RESULTS: Complete resolution of the subretinal fluid was achieved in all cases with the tumor height decreased. Visual acuity improved to 1 line or more in 5 eyes and remained stable in 2 eyes. Two cases that underwent proton therapy developed radiation retinopathy. CONCLUSION: External beam radiation is an effective and safe option in the management of choroidal hemangiomas complicated by retinal detachment. Based on our experience, proton therapy should be reserved for sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization

All patients had locally advanced disease without evidence of distant metastases. Partial compensation for tissue inhomogeneities was accomplished. Although palliation of symptoms and regression of tumor was commonly seen, local failure occurred in most patients (77%). The median survival was 8 months. It does not appear that an increase in tumor dose relative to normal tissues can be achieved that would be high enough to increase locoregional control rates over historical control rates with low-LET irradiation. Further studies will be carried out with heavier particles such as neon or silicon in hopes of achieving greater biological effect on these difficult-to-control tumors

0	639	Proton radiotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcome and a dosimetric comparison with photons	Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Massachusetts, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Over 85% of pediatric orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are cured with combined chemotherapy and radiation. However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, cT2-3N0M0, underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s), followed by pelvic X-ray irradiation combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy with methotrexate and cisplatin. Upon completion of these treatments, patients were evaluated by transurethral resection biopsy. Patients with no residual tumor received proton irradiation boost to the primary sites, whereas patients demonstrating residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 23 (92%) were free of residual tumor at the time of re-evaluation; consequently, proton beam therapy was applied. The remaining 2 patients presenting with residual tumors underwent radical cystectomy. Of the 23 patients treated with proton beam therapy, 9 experienced recurrence at the median follow-up time of 4.8 years: local recurrences and distant metastases in 6 and 2 patients, respectively, and both situations in 1. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. The 5-year local control and bladder-preservation rates were 73% and 96%, respectively, in the patients treated with proton beam therapy. Therapy-related toxicities of Grade 3-4 were observed in 9 patients: hematologic toxicities in 6, pulmonary thrombosis in 1, and hemorrhagic cystitis in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The present bladder-preserving regimen for invasive bladder cancer was feasible and effective. Proton beam therapy might improve local control and facilitate bladder preservation

Results of the first 42 treated tumors in 31 patients are presented. Most of the patients had solitary tumors in liver, lung or retroperitoneal space. Clinical target volumes ranged from 2 to 622 cm3 (mean 78 cm3) and minimum doses to the planning target volumes (PTV) of 7.7-30 Gy/fraction (mean 14.2 Gy) were given on 1-4 occasions to a total minimum dose to the PTVs of 7.7-45 Gy (mean 30.2 Gy) to the periphery of the PTV and total mean doses to the PTVs of 8-66 Gy (mean 41 Gy). The central part of the tumor was usually given about 50% higher dose compared to that of the periphery of the PTV by a planned inhomogeneous dose distribution. Some of the patients received stereotactic radiation therapy concomitantly to more than one target, in others new metastases were also treated which appeared during the follow-up period. We observed a local rate of no progressive disease of 80% during a follow-up period of 1.5-38 months. Fifty percent of the tumors decreased in size or disappeared	
0	1920	Evaluation of the effect of high-energy proton irradiation treatment on meningiomas by means of 11C-L-methionine PET	Adult, Aged, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Meningioma/pa [Pathology], Meningioma/ri [Radionuclide Imaging], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methionine/du [Diagnostic Use], Middle Aged, Protons, Radioactivity, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radiopharmaceuticals/du [Diagnostic Use], Radiotherapy, Recurrence, Sweden, Tomography,Emission-Computed, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A remnant meningioma of WHO grade I that is located at the base of the skull and is treated with radiotherapy has to be followed up for at least 5-10 years to evaluate the treatment effect and detect recurrence. The tumour has to grow considerably to show detectable volume increase on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Owing to the location at the base of the skull, a small increase in tumour volume may be hazardous. It is thus important to find a method to evaluate treatment effects earlier and potentially detect those tumours that have a tendency to grow. Nineteen patients with intracranial meningiomas were given irradiation with the 180-MeV proton beam at the Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden. The fractionation schedule used was in general a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6-Gy fractions. Serial 11C-Lmethionine PET examinations were used to evaluate the effect of stereotactic proton beam treatment. The radioactivity uptake in the tumour was evaluated as the ratio to the uptake in normal brain tissue. The follow-up period thus far is 36 months. In 15 of the 19 patients, 11C-L-methionine uptake was reduced 36 months after irradiation compared with the pre-treatment uptake of the tracer. In the total patient group the average reduction was 19.4%. Our results reveal that proton beam irradiation of meningiomas had an inhibitory effect on the methionine uptake in the meningiomas, although tumour size remained unchanged. The combination of unchanged tumour morphology and a reduction in methionine uptake after irradiation suggests that 11C-L-methionine PET might enable earlier evaluation of the treatment effect than is possible with CT or MRI

The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A targeting system that integrates a CT-on-rails scanner with a linear accelerator (LINAC) was evaluated in the lead-in portion of a Phase I/II protocol for treating patients with paraspinal metastases. Patients were immobilized in supine position by a moldable body cushion vacuum wrapped with a plastic fixation sheet. Planning CT and immediately repeated CT were performed on the LINAC/CT-on-rails unit to assess respiratory-related vertebral body motion. Coplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using 7-9 beams was used to deliver 30 Gy in five fractions to the target volume, while limiting the spinal cord dose to <10 Gy. Pretreatment CT scans were fused with the planning CT scans to determine the correct target isocenter by accounting for any translational and roll (axial) rotational discrepancies from the planning CT. (Corrections caused by yaw and pitch rotations have not yet been implemented.) The reproducibility of the treatment isocenter as compared with the planned isocenter was measured with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), portal film imaging, and immediate post-treatment verification CT scans. Phantom measurements were taken for dose verification for each IMRT plan. RESULTS: Based on a total of 36 CT scans (3 for planning, 3 for respiration study, 15 pretreatment, and 15 post-treatment) from 3 patients, no respiration-associated vertebral body motion was seen. A comparison of the corrected daily anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) digital portal images with the planning AP and LAT DRRs confirmed that the isocenter setup accuracy for the 15 treatments was within 1 mm of the planning isocenter. The results from the immediate post-treatment CT scans reconfirmed the findings from the portal images and verified the absence of spinal movement during the treatment. The ion-chamber measurement for the high-dose region was within 2% of the planning dose for three patient treatment plans. Film dose measurement in an IMRT quality assurance phantom demonstrated good agreement from 90% to 30% isodose lines between the planned and measured results. CONCLUSION: Preliminary experience suggests that the near-simultaneous CT image-guided verification technique can be used as a new platform technology for extracranial applications of stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery to spinal and paraspinal tumors

Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned

The localisation and locally-destructive growth require a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic concept early on.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the hospital records of 10 consecutive patients (4 women and 6 men) whom we had treated during a period of 7 years. RESULTS: The first step in therapy was tumour resection in 9 cases. One patient initially underwent stereotactic radiation. Postoperative radiation was not included a priori, but discussed individually depending on the degree of resection, the patient's age and physical condition. After an average 5 years follow up, 100 % of patients are alive. In all patients, tumour control was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with chordomas of the skull base has improved considerably in recent years. New technologies like intraoperative navigation and improved radiation procedures have contributed to this improvement. The basis for treatment remains, however, the greatest possible surgical exstirpation with minimal surgical morbidity. Special attention should be paid in this connection to the stability of the cervical spine and the craniocervical transition border. In advanced tumour growth, complete resection is often not possible. Proton and heavy-ion radiation are promising new forms of therapy, which can also be applied after conventional radiation has been performed. A directed multidisciplinary procedure guarantees years of survival with good quality of life in many cases

Gross total resection with negative margins is rarely achieved, and the risks of functional, structural, and cosmetic deficits limit the radiation dose using conventional radiation techniques. Twenty-nine children and adolescents treated with conformal proton radiotherapy (proton RT) were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1992 and April 1999, 29 patients with mesenchymal tumors underwent fractionated proton (13 patients) or fractionated combined proton and photon (16 patients) irradiation. The age at treatment ranged from 1 to 19 years (median 12); 14 patients were male and 15 female. Tumors were grouped as malignant or benign. Twenty patients had malignant histologic findings, including chordoma (n = 10), chondrosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), and other sarcomas (n = 3). Target doses ranged between 50.4 and 78.6 Gy/cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE), delivered at doses of 1.8-2.0 Gy/CGE per fraction. The benign histologic findings included giant cell tumors (n = 6), angiofibromas (n = 2), and chondroblastoma (n = 1). RT doses for this group ranged from 45.0 to 71.8 Gy/CGE. Despite maximal surgical resection, 28 (97%) of 29 patients had gross disease at the time of proton RT. Follow-up after proton RT ranged from 13 to 92 months (mean 40). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients with malignant tumors, 5 (25%) had local failure; 1 patient had failure in the surgical access route and 3 patients developed distant metastases. Seven patients had died of progressive disease at the time of analysis. Local tumor control was maintained in 6 (60%) of 10 patients with chordoma, 3 (100%) of 3 with chondrosarcoma, 4 (100%) of 4 with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 (66%) of 3 with other sarcomas. The actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate was 72% and 56%, respectively, and the overall survival of the males was significantly superior to that of the female patients (p = 0.002). Of the patients with benign tumors, 1 patient (giant cell tumor) had local failure at 10 months. The other 8 patients continued to have local tumor control; all 9 patients were alive at last follow-up (actuarial 5-year local control and overall survival rate of 89% and 100%, respectively). Severe late effects (motor weakness and sensory deficits) were observed in 2 (7%) of 29 patients. CONCLUSION: Proton RT for children with aggressively recurring tumors after major skull base surgery can offer a considerable prospect of tumor control and survival. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess the real value of protons, in particular with regard to bone growth and cosmetic outcome

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

METHODS: Two patients initially diagnosed and treated for unilateral scleritis were referred for management of persistent inflammation. Additional evaluation uncovered underlying malignant processes. RESULTS: The first patient presented with scleritis initially responsive to systemic corticosteroids, with relapse one month later. Upon referral, peripheral fundus examination revealed elevated lesions. Additional studies confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The patient was treated with proton-beam irradiation. The second patient developed necrotizing scleritis unresponsive to systemic steroids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. A scleral biopsy disclosed an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma, likely metastatic. Exenteration was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis can present a diagnostic challenge. It is often the sole initial manifestation of an occult systemic problem. Treatment-resistant scleritis should raise the suspicion of an infectious or malignant masquerade

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton MR spectroscopy in a clinical MR imager was used to ascertain the amount of whole-brain NAA before and immediately after whole-brain radiation therapy 3-4 weeks later. Eight patients (four women, four men; median age, 55 years; age range, 39-70 years) were studied. All subjects had lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 5], small-cell lung cancer [n = 3]) and received either palliative or prophylactic whole-brain radiation therapy. Six of them also underwent a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for correlation with the whole-brain NAA. Two-tailed Student t tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: A significant (P = .042) average decline in whole-brain NAA of -0.91 mmol per person was observed in the cohort. No corresponding changes occurred in MMSE scores. There was no significant difference in whole-brain NAA decline between prophylactic and therapeutic whole-brain radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since whole-brain NAA loss was detected even when MMSE scores were unchanged, the former seems to be a more sensitive measure of radiation therapy injury than is the latter

The estimation of absorbed dose and optimization of treatment dose based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in melanoma patients is described. The doses of gamma-rays were measured using small TLDs of Mg2SiO4 (Tb) and thermal neutron fluence was measured using gold foil and wire. The total absorbed dose to the tissue from BNCT was obtained by summing the primary and capture gamma-ray doses and the high LET radiation doses from 10B(n, alpha)7Li and 14N(n,p)14C reactions. The key point of the dose optimization is that the skin surrounding the tumour is always irradiated to 18 Gy-Eq, which is the maximum tolerable dose to the skin, regardless of the 10B-concentration in the tumor. The neutron fluence was optimized as follows. (1) The 10B concentration in the blood was measured 15-40 min after the start of neutron irradiation. (2) The 10B-concentration in the skin was estimated by multiplying the blood 10B value by a factor of 1.3. (3) The neutron fluence was calculated. Absorbed doses to the skin ranged from 15.7 to 37.1 Gy-Eq. Among the patients, 16 out of 22 patients exhibited tolerable skin damage. Although six patients showed skin damage that exceeded the tolerance level, three of them could be cured within a few months after BNCT and the remaining three developed severe skin damage requiring skin grafts. The absorbed doses to the tumor ranged from 15.7 to 68.5 Gy-Eq and the percentage of complete response was 73% (16/22). When BNCT is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, based on the pharmacokinetics of BPA and radiobiological considerations, promising clinical results have been obtained, although many problems and issues remain to be solved

[German]	Adolescent, Bone and Bones/pa [Pathology], Child, Extremities, Female, Humans, Hyperplasia/et [Etiology], Hyperplasia/pa [Pathology], Hyperplasia/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Methods, Ossification,Heterotopic/et [Etiology], Ossification,Heterotopic/pa [Pathology], Ossification,Heterotopic/rt [Radiotherapy], Osteogenesis Imperfecta/co [Complications], Osteogenesis Imperfecta/pa [Pathology], Osteogenesis Imperfecta/rt [Radiotherapy], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Remission Induction, Risk	PURPOSE: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare hereditary disease of connective tissue with a genetic defect in collagen synthesis. In osteogenesis imperfecta hyperplastic heterotopic ossification can be induced by hyperplastic callus formation caused by trauma or operation. Heterotopic ossifications can be found in numerous benign diseases. The successful use of low dose radiotherapy in the treatment of heterotopic ossifications is well-known from the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated two children (a 13-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy) with heterotopic ossifications of the lower extremities in osteogenesis imperfecta type IV (Lobstein) with a low dose irradiation (10 x 1 Gy, respectively 6 x 1 Gy) under megavoltage conditions. RESULTS: After radiotherapy the children were painfree and the hyperplastic callus was considerably reduced. The previously immobilized patients could partly be mobilized. Thereby it could be contributed to the rehabilitation of the patients. New hyperplastic callus formation was not observed in the irradiated areas so far. CONCLUSION: Analogous to the successful radiation of heterotopic ossifications in other benign diseases radiation therapy seems to be a successful treatment of hyperplastic callus formation in osteogenesis imperfecta. Despite the late risks of radiotherapy radiation treatment of benign diseases in children might be indicated

Three-dimensional conformation of the treatment volume to the target volume can thus be achieved. Following previously reported Phase I and Ib clinical trials, a Phase II trial was initiated with the goal of treating primary deep-seated tumors in a dose optimization schedule which included stepwise increase of total pion dose and of target volume. Patients with multicentric superficial bladder tumors who were cystectomy candidates were initially selected. Since then, more invasive cases have been treated. A graded scoring of acute tissue reactions was employed. Follow-up periods were from 10 to 20 months. The pion dose escalation ranged from 3000 rad (minimum) to 3600 rad (minimum) in 20 fractions over 5 weeks. The treatment volumes encompassed 190 cc for local to 1,820 cc for extended volume therapy. Treatment reactions ranged from a faint erythema and increase of bladder frequency to dry desquamation, mild nausea, moderate dysuria, and moderate proctitis or diarrhea with mucus. These reactions were closely related to treatment volume and site. One severe late cystitis has occurred in a patient treated with 2 courses of pions (4475 rad). Mild to moderate late proctitis has been seen in 4 patients. Ten of 13 bladder cancer patients had local control of disease while all 3 pancreas or biliary tract cancer patients had microscopic residual disease locally at time of death from metastasis. A total of 11 of 17 patients are thus clinically or pathologically free of local tumor to time of last observation

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

Six patients had positron emission tomography 15 to 25 minutes after radiation therapy with a 42 MeV accelerator. Five patients had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and one required therapy for a carcinoma of the common bile duct. We sought to determine whether state-of-the-art PET technology could be used to monitor the three-dimensional activity distribution of radiation-induced radioactivity. At the time of the examination all six patients had sufficient concentrations of C-11 and N-13 activity in the irradiated volume to permit the evaluation of the activity distribution. We found significant activity at the body surface, which permitted field delineation. We conclude that the in vivo generated radioactivity can be monitored with PET

All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with proton beam irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases. The results of our study seem to confirm the reliability of standardized A and B scan ultrasonography in the follow-up of PCMM treated with proton beam irradiation; if ultrasonography is used together with FV and ICGV, the reliability of this combination is surely higher

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients between 1990 and 2005 with the diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancer was performed. Of 125 total patients new onset urothelial carcinoma developed in 11 after undergoing external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy with a proton boost to the prostate was the radiation modality in 7 of the 11 patients (64%), while the remaining 4 patients received standard external beam radiation only. Urothelial carcinoma was detected a mean of 3.07 years after completion of radiation therapy in the proton group, compared to a mean latency period of 5.75 years in the standard radiation group (p = 0.09). Average patient age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 64 to 84). All patients presented with gross hematuria and had cystoscopic findings of coexisting radiation cystitis. Of the 11 patients 5 (45%) presented with grade 3 carcinoma and eventually 7 (64%) required radical cystectomy. Urothelial tumors with sarcomatoid features (carcinosarcoma and spindle cell sarcomatoid) developed in 2 patients (18%). Of the 11 patients 10 (91%) were nonsmokers at the time of urothelial carcinoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma in patients with previous radiation therapy for prostate cancer is often high grade, and the majority of patients have cancer progression requiring cystectomy. A high incidence of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features was seen in these patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients

One patient was an 85-year-old man with early gastric cancer of type IIa + IIc. The other one was a 70 year old man with early gastric cancer of type IIc. In both cases histological examination of biopsy specimens showed differentiated adenocarcinoma; distant metastasis was not found by other examinations. Both patients were considered inoperable due to their poor cardiac and/or respiratory functions. Therefore, it was decided to treat them by definitive proton irradiation, delivering total doses of 86 Gy and 83 Gy, respectively. In both patients, skin erythema that did not require any special treatment was found in the irradiation field. Hematobiological examinations did not show any abnormality. Although endoscopic examination at two years after irradiation in the former case and at seven months in the latter case showed persistent gastric ulcer at the site of the cancerous lesions, cancer cells were not found histologically. Therefore, we concluded that proton irradiation therapy was useful for inoperable early gastric cancers

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years). Tumors were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients. 25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or residual disease following subtotal resection. Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%). Four patients with optic pathway tumors were treated without histologic confirmation. Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (all located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died. By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central tumors, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric tumors, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for tumors located in the brainstem. Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated. All children with local control maintained their performance status. One child with associated neurofibromatosis, Type 1, developed Moyamoya disease. All six patients with optic pathway tumors and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status. CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality. Results are encouraging for central tumors as well as large optic pathway tumors, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve. Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of normal tissue sparing

[Russian]	Brain, Brain Diseases/di [Diagnosis], Brain Diseases/et [Etiology], Electroencephalography, Galvanic Skin Response, Humans, Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Plethysmography, Protons, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Temporal Lobe	Sixty patients with pituitary endosellar adenomas irradiated with the proton beam were examined using EEG prior to and following irradiation in the period ranging from 14 days to 3 years. Fourteen days to three months after the proton irradiation, intensified irritation of the diencephalic structures was recorded. Later on, gradual normalization of bioelectrical activity was observed. Local changes in the temporal lobes, probably associated with the tissue response to irradiation by the proton beam were noted only in 8 out of the 60 patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1991 and September 2001, 1,406 patients with uveal melanoma were treated by proton beam radiotherapy. A total dose of 60 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) was delivered in 4 fractions on 4 days. Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate analysis using the Cox model. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 73 months (range, 24-142 months). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival rates were 79% and 80.6%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 96%. The 5-year enucleation for complications rate was 7.7%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.0003), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (p = 0.02), tumor diameter (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.003). Independent prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival were age (p = 0.0042), retinal detachment (p = 0.01), tumor site (p < 0.0001), tumor volume (p < 0.0001), local recurrence (p < 0.0001), and retinal area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.002). Independent prognostic factors for local control were tumor diameter (p = 0.003) and macular area receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.01). Independent prognostic factors for enucleation for complications were tumor thickness (p < 0.0001) and lens volume receiving at least 30 CGE (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that proton beam radiotherapy ensures an excellent local control rate. Further clinical studies are required to decrease the incidence of postirradiation ocular complications	
0	722	Comparative treatment planning on localized prostate carcinoma conformal photon- versus proton-based radiotherapy	Femur/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To assess the potential benefit of proton-beam therapy in comparison to 3-D conformal photon therapy and photon- based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma for various stages of disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

[German]	Adult, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/ra [Radiography], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Patient Care Planning/mt [Methods], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tomography,X-Ray Computed	A report is given about radiotherapy in 41 patients suffering from cerebral vessel anomalies. A modified linear accelerator was used in a moving field technique with multiple pendulum planes to apply single doses between 8 and 28 Gy by means of stereotaxis into the angiographically determined target volume. The medium follow-up is 23 months. The latency of radiogenic effects is between one and two years. Radiological controls with an interval of more than 18 months after therapy are available in 17 out of 41 patients. Angiographic investigation showed complete obliterations of pathological vessels in six out of these patients and partial obliterations in six patients; five patients remained unchanged. There were no acute complications. Seven patients presented neurological deficiencies with a latency of 6 to 12 months, however, in all cases but one they regressed completely. Even taking into consideration the small number of patients and the short time of observation, a comparison with the results of other radiotherapeutical proceedings allows to draw the conclusion that the presented technique of stereotaxic convergent-beam irradiation represents a relatively simple, reliable and, in case of precise indication, efficient method for the therapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients treated between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients presented with locally recurrent (n = 17), T2 (n = 20), high-grade (n = 26), or incompletely resected tumors (n = 11). All patients underwent limbsparing surgery and IORT (median dose of 15 Gy) given either with high-dose-rate brachytherapy or a linear accelerator. 25 patients received additional EBRT with a mean of 50.6 Gy (range: 30.6-60 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-5.6 years). RESULTS: The 5-year overall and distant disease-free survival rates were 66% and 54%, respectively. The overall actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years is 16% (95% CI: 1%, 31%). The crude rate after 8 years is 18%. Surgical margin status, primary versus recurrent tumor and tumor stage did not show any statistically significant influence (univariate analysis) on local recurrence rates. Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas, IORT +/- EBRT after limb-preserving surgery achieves high local control rates. The risk of normal tissue toxicities is comparable to conventional limb-sparing treatment

[Russian]	Aged, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The proton beam of the 157 MeV synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was modified for irradiation of prostatic cancer patients. Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year

The majority received 30 Gy of 3 MeV electrons in 12 treatments over three weeks. Eighty-eight patients had received prior therapy. Fifty patients had cutaneous plaques only (T1-2N0), and 56 had more advanced disease. At five years, actuarial survival is 66.7% and disease-free survival 21.4%. The median time to relapse is 12 months; prolonged survival is seen only with complete response. Compared with more advanced stages, T1-2N0 patients have more frequent complete response (96% vs 71%) and better relapse-free survival at five years (32 vs 7%). Of 14 patients with T2 disease in continuous complete remission for from 45-113 months, only one has relapsed. This suggests that cure is possible in up to 26% of patients with T2 disease who achieve complete response. In advanced stages, complete response is more likely with doses over 25 Gy (80 vs 50%). First recurrences were predominently in sites of previous involvement. Death resulted mainly from extracutaneous dissemination or failure to induce remission

A 20-year-old patient with NF2 presenting deafness due to bilateral acoustic neurinomas and unilateral amaurosis due to a meningioma of the optic nerve developed a pigmented parapapillary choroidal tumor. Despite signs indicating the diagnosis of a melanoma, periodic observation was chosen in order to postpone functional amputation following optic nerve irradiation. The tumor growth was slow during the 5 years that followed, and once progression became rapid, the tumor was treated by accelerated proton beam radiotherapy. One year later, visual acuity diminished due to actinic optic neuropathy and was stabilized at 0.3 for the 2 following years. The tumor presented objective signs of regression, and no sign of metastatic disease was observed. The therapeutic approach in this case provided local control of the tumor while preserving useful visual function

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

A retrospective study	Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intestinal Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Intestinal Diseases/et [Etiology], Male, Morbidity, Norway/ep [Epidemiology], Particle Accelerators, Questionnaires, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology], Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Urologic Diseases/ep [Epidemiology], Urologic Diseases/et [Etiology]	48 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer were asked by a mailed questionnaire concerning post-radiotherapy functional status, urological and intestinal complaints. All patients had received curative pelvic irradiation (greater than or equal to 1750 reu) nine to 133 months prior to the investigation. Eleven patients had recurrent or persistent disease and four (36%) of these patients had severe hematuria. The urinary morbidity of the 37 patients without evidence of disease varied between 24 and 38%, but only 3 to 8% of these patients experienced severe disturbances. Four patients (9%) had to undergo bowl resection due to severe radiation damage in the intestines. In conclusion, slight morbidity after curative radiation treatment is to be expected in about 30% of patients surviving more than six months. Severe complications may be expected in 10% of the patients. Serious complaints from the urologic tract, especially hematuria, indicate recurrent or persistent disease rather than a late radiation effect

These methods may become cumbersome and time-consuming if high time resolution is required or if the geometry is complex. Furthermore, it is difficult to study double-dynamic systems, e.g., to investigate the influence of time-dependent beam delivery (i.e., magnetically moving beam spots in proton beam scanning) on the dose deposition in a moving target. We recently introduced the technique of 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation to model continuously changing geometries. In intensity modulated proton therapy, dose is delivered by individual pristine Bragg curves. Dose spots are positioned in the patient by varying magnetic field and beam energy. If the movement of these dose spots occurs during significant respiratory motion, interplay effects can take place. Because of the inhomogeneity of individual subfields, the consequences of motion can be more severe than in conventional proton therapy. We demonstrate how the technique of 4D Monte Carlo can be used to study interplay effects in proton beam scanning. Time-dependent beam delivery to a changing patient geometry is simulated in a single 4D dose calculation. Interplay effects between respiratory motion and beam scanning speed are demonstrated

Immediate and late tolerances were excellent in all cases (follow-up 2 to 50 months). Two patients recurred locally (marginal failures), seven are alive and doing well. At Loma Linda, 28 children were treated between 1991 and 1994, 16 for a benign tumor of the brain and twelve for a malignant one. With a follow-up of seven to 49 months, three patients died (grade 2 to 4 gliomas), one is living with a persistent disease. Four children had treatment-related toxicity (one cataract, two hormonal failures and two seizures). The other children are doing well. At MGH Boston, 18 children with skull base-cervical spine chordomas have been reported. At five years, actuarial survival and disease-free survival have been 68 and 63%, respectively. Children with cervical sites had a worse prognosis (p = 0.008). Four children had radiation-related morbidity: two pituitary failures, one temporal lobe necrosis, one temporal muscle fibrosis. In this experience, such rare tumors seemed to behave in children like in adults

All patients had undergone a subtotal surgical resection. Twenty-three patients were treated definitively with charged particles, 13 patients were treated with photons and particles, and 9 patients were treated for recurrent disease. Total doses ranged from 36 to 80 Gray equivalent (GyE). Thirty-three patients are alive with a minimum followup of 1 year. The actuarial survival and local control for all patients at 5 years is 62% and 59%, respectively. Patients treated for primary disease had a 78% actuarial local control rate at 2 years, whereas the rate for patients with recurrent disease was 33%. Patients with smaller visible tumor volumes (less than 20 cc) had a significantly better local control rate than patients with larger tumor volumes (80% vs 33% actuarial rate at 5 years). Patients with chondrosarcoma had the highest local control rate, as did patients treated with particles alone. Complications included 3 patients with unilateral visual loss, two patients who became blind, and 4 patients with radiation injury to the brainstem

Both radical surgical removal and high-dose radiation therapy, particularly proton beam therapy, reportedly are effective in tumor control and improve survival rates. The authors posit that these tumors are best treated with radical surgery and proton-photon beam therapy. During the last 5 years, they treated 25 patients (15 females and 10 males) who harbored pathologically diagnosed skull base chordomas. The mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range 8-61 years). Previous surgery or radiation therapy was performed at other institutions in seven and two patients, respectively. The authors performed 33 surgical procedures on 23 patients. Radical removal (defined as absence of residual tumor on operative inspection and postoperative imaging) was achieved in 10 patients; subtotal resection (defined as resection of > 90% of the tumor) was achieved in 11 patients; and partial resection (defined as resection of < 90% of the tumor) was achieved in two patients. Radical surgical removal included not only the excision of soft-tumor tissue, but also extensive drilling of the adjacent bone. Adjuvant therapy consisted of postoperative combined proton-photon beam therapy (given to 17 patients and planned for one patient) and conventional radiation therapy (two patients); three patients received no adjunct therapy. To date, four patients have died. One patient who had undergone previous surgery and sacrifice of the internal carotid artery died postoperatively from a massive stroke; one patient died from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without evidence of recurrence; and two patients died at 25 and 39 months of recurrent tumor. Permanent neurological complications included third cranial nerve palsy (one patient) and hemianopsia (one patient); radiation necrosis occurred in three patients. Of the 21 patients followed for more than 3 months after surgery, 16 have had no evidence of recurrence and five (including the two mortalities noted above) have had recurrent tumors (four diagnosed clinically and one radiologically). The mean disease-free interval was 14.4 months. A longer follow-up period will, hopefully, support the early indication that radical surgical removal and postoperative proton-photon beam therapy is an efficacious treatment. The use of skull base approaches based on the tumor classification introduced in this paper is associated with low mortality and morbidity rates

Two different chemotherapy regimens were used for concurrent chemoradiation. In the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was infused intravenously, followed immediately by five consecutive daily administrations of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2/day, each infused intravenously over 24 hr. As for the patients with adenocarcinoma, 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 250 mg/m2 of cytoxan and 45 mg/m2 of adriamycin were administered intravenously on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 54.4% with stage III and IV, 62.6% with lymph node metastasis on computed tomogram or MRI, 77.9% with stage I-II disease with lesion size > or =4 cm, and 50.3% with small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Side effects from concurrent chemoradiation such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were present in all 395 cases. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were observed to varying degrees, but there was no toxic death. This study suggests that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation in treating cervical cancer patients with high risk factors is effective and relatively well tolerated, with acceptable toxicity

Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins. METHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: Total en bloc spondylectomy with wide surgical margins is feasible for malignant bone tumors of the cervical spine

[French]	Adult, Aged, Brachytherapy, Cobalt, Combined Modality Therapy, Conjunctival Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Conjunctival Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Conjunctival Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Cryosurgery, Cryotherapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Methods, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/et [Etiology], Orbit, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Risk, Skin, Switzerland, Visual Acuity/ph [Physiology]	BACKGROUND: Conjunctival melanomas are malignant tumors with a high local recurrence rate after simple surgical excision. The rate of recurrence is particularly high in cases of large size tumor, of widespread tumors and with PAM associated lesions. Tumor recurrences have a bad long-term prognostic significance and often necessitate exenteration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A method of therapy combining total surgical excision with proton-beam irradiation, cobalt plaque irradiation and cryotherapy is described. This technique is used in particular unfavorable cases with the aim of lowering the rate of recurrences. It was practiced in 19 cases in Lausanne, 10 of which were recurrent tumors. The melanoma invaded 3 quadrants of the bulbar conjunctiva in 8 cases and 4 quadrants in 11 cases. At least one neighbouring tarsal conjunctiva was invaded in 11 cases and both in 7 cases. The skin of the eyelid was infiltrated in 6 cases and the caruncle in 9 cases. Tumor thickness was 1 to 2 mm in 8 cases, 3 to 4 mm in 4 cases and 5 to 10 mm in 7 cases. RESULTS: PAM was present in 16 cases. Follow-up period was less than 1 year in 2 cases, between 1 to 2 years in 5 cases, between 2 to 3 years in 5 cases and more than 3 years in 7 cases. 5 patients had lymph node metastases, 3 died of metastatic disease and 2 had a local recurrence. One of these recurrences was small-sized and was excised, the other was widespread and the patient died soon with metastatic disease. No exenteration was performed. CONCLUSION: The method of therapy that is here described appears to be a valuable alternative to exenteration of the orbit for the treatment of diffuse or large-size conjunctival melanomas which have a high risk of local recurrence

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with medication refractory idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia were treated with a single fraction of 80 Gy to the trigeminal nerve root. For treatment delivery, a 4-mm collimator and a 7-arc technique were delivered using a stereotactic floor stand system with an isocenter stability of 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm to minimize dose to the brainstem. Treatment delivery time was approximately 55 minutes. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 1-40 mo), 57% of patients achieved complete pain relief and 75% (exact 95% confidence interval, 55 to 89%) had their pain reduced to 3 or less on a 10-point pain scale. Median time to pain relief was 1 month. Four patients did not respond to treatment. The actuarial mean time to pain recurrence in responders was 14 months, and the actuarial mean response duration in major to complete responders was 16 months. Women had significantly longer mean time to pain recurrence than men (16 versus 7 months; P = 0.05). Three patients reported new mild facial numbness after radiosurgery and one patient developed neurotrophic keratopathy. CONCLUSION: Linear accelerator-based radiosurgery for medication refractory trigeminal neuralgia provides effective pain relief with a low complication rate

The purpose of this study was to describe an alternative technique for orbital exenteration and its specific advantages over traditional methods. METHODS: A retrospective analysis at a tertiary care referral center was performed. Three patients with sinonasal malignancy (two cases) and fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis (one case) are reported. Intraconal involvement was evident in all patients by imaging and surgical pathology. Advanced endoscopic techniques in conjunction with image guidance and soft-tissue shaver technology were used for resection in all cases. RESULTS: The orbit was successfully exenterated via an eyelid-sparing endoscopic approach with minimal blood loss in all three patients. Exenteration was completed within 30-45 minutes. Uninvolved superior and lateral orbital periosteum was preserved in all patients, which permitted cavity "mucosalization" within 8 weeks. Two patients are alive without disease at 15-month follow-up. One patient with persistent cavernous sinus malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor died 4 months after resection despite proton beam therapy. CONCLUSION: This preliminary experience showed endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration to be an effective technique for exenteration of the orbit. Endoscopic power-assisted orbital exenteration offers two critical advantages: (1) direct transnasal control of the ophthalmic artery as it emerges from the optic foramen and (2) the ability to preserve the uninvolved superior and lateral periorbita. This can facilitate mucosal coverage of the exenterated space and obviate the need for tissue grafts and/or packing. Additionally, intraorbital pathology can be better visualized and blood loss and operative time are minimized. This technique may serve as an important adjunct for management of the orbit in patients with sinonasal malignancy or invasive fungal rhinosinusitis	
0	1791	Use of high-frequency ultrasound imaging to improve delineation of anterior uveal melanoma for proton irradiation	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biophysics, Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Choroid Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Ciliary Body, Female, Humans, Iris Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Iris Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography], Light, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/su [Surgery], Melanoma/us [Ultrasonography], Middle Aged, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Sclera, Software, Sutures, Tantalum, Transillumination, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Uveal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Uveal Neoplasms/us [Ultrasonography]	The aim of this study was to evaluate high-frequency ultrasound imaging (HFUI) as an aid in localizing anterior margins of tumours of the eye for proton therapy. Proton irradiation of ocular melanoma requires an accurate assessment of all tumour margins. The tumour is marked surgically by suturing to the sclera four or five tantalum rings on the borders of the tumour defined by transillumination. In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-frequency ultrasound imaging, four and five rings were surgically placed in a patient with an iris/ciliary body melanoma and in a patient with ciliochoroidal melanoma using transillumination to localize the tumour margins. Subsequently margins were verified by HFUI. In the first patient, the distances between the rings and the limbus were measured using calipers during surgery and were compared with HFUI measurements and measurements from planning software. The distances were comparable within 0.5 mm. In the second patient the treatment was planned in two different ways using EYEPLAN software. In the first scenario the shape of the tumour and its relation to the rings were obtained from the surgeon's mapping, the fundus drawing using a transilluminating point light source, and the HFUI. In the second scenario, the shape of the tumour was deduced from the ring positions only. It was observed that the maximum difference between the tumour edge as seen on high-frequency ultrasound images and the rings was 2.6 mm. The tumour volume was underestimated by 39% when tumour shape was obtained from ring positions only. During the past year we have utilized HFUI in 18 patients having tumours involving the anterior segment of the eye, among which four were treated with proton therapy. In conclusion, we believe that high-frequency ultrasound imaging provides additional information with respect to the location of tumour margins in ciliary body and anterior uveal melanoma. Occult extension of the tumour within the ciliary body or posterior iris may not be appreciated by transillumination alone

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI

The authors report the results of treatment of 10 patients, six with chordoma, three with chondrosarcoma, and one with a neurofibrosarcoma. Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45% and 79%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In CIRT for advanced cervical cancer, the dose to the intestines should be limited to <60 GyE to avoid major complications. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support continued investigation to confirm therapeutic efficacy

It was found that pronounced changes in tumor tissue are caused by such preoperative treatment: tumor is reduced in size, DNA synthesis and mitotic activity are suppressed considerably and pathological mitoses increase. Morphological observations show that rectal adenocarcinoma is markedly susceptible to brehmstrahlung irradiation from a 25 MEV betatron

Averaging and expansion operations are provided to improve the target coverage if the patient moves slightly during treatment, and a structure-sparing option is provided to protect critical structures lying downstream from the target. The new compensator design options were evaluated for two patients who had skull-base tumours. When the patient and compensator were perfectly aligned, the new PB compensator designs provided target coverage comparable to, if not better than, standard compensator designs for both patients. Furthermore, the volume of normal tissue distal to the target which received in excess of 95% of the prescription dose was roughly a factor of two lower for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In the event of patient motion, on average, the volume of the target receiving 95% or more of the prescribed dose was 3% less for the averaged PB compensators than for the expanded standard compensators. In conclusion, the new compensator design options evaluated in this investigation provide better protection for normal tissues distal to the target volume than standard compensator designs, with only a modest decrease in target volume coverage in the event of patient motion

A slight but significant difference was noted between the two T categories. Fifty-three patients who were tumour-free 3 to 4 months after irradiation had a 55 per cent survival. No other prognostic parameters were identified on the basis of histologic or radiologic findings. In 14 patients severe radiation complications were observed (bladder 9, small bowel 3, combined 2). In patients with radiation sensitive bladder carcinoma, radical radiation therapy seems to be a comparable alternative to total cystectomy

T2 may be significantly prolonged within 2 h after ingestion of glucose and fructose due to changed water distribution in the melanoma. This method is used to follow melanomas for up to 6 years after proton beam irradiation. In the tumours, T2 was shortened in parallel in all the lesions during the first 9 months. After this, T2 increased only in tumours which showed recurrence. T2 determination and histopathological examination revealed no signs of recurrence in eyes which were enucleated due to neovascular glaucoma. It is concluded that MR imaging performed with carbohydrate loading, registers metabolic changes induced in the tumour, giving this method great validity in the follow-up of choroidal malignant melanoma after irradiation. Eighteen patients treated with proton beam for uveal melanoma at the cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden, were followed

Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma

We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments

METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients with cervical carcinoma stages IIB-IVA who were treated with primary irradiation between the years 1985 and 1988 comprised the study group. The median survival of patients treated with 60cobalt units and linear accelerators was calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared using the log-rank test. Recurrence patterns were compared using chi-square analysis; p < .05 was considered significant for all tests. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five patients were treated with 60cobalt units (Group 1) and 53 patients were treated with a linear accelerator (Group 2). Group 1 and 2 were similar with regard to mean age and weight, stage distribution, and mean dose to point A. The rate of recurrence was comparable between Group 1 and 2 (65.6% vs. 64.2%) and no significant difference was found in overall survival between the groups (20 months vs. 21 months. p = 81). There was a trend toward increasing pelvic recurrence in Group 1 (50.8%) compared to Group 2 (35.8%, p = .08). CONCLUSIONS: 60Cobalt units and linear accelerators offer comparable rates of overall survival in patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma

METHOD: A retrospective review was made of 218 patients (218 eyes) treated with helium ion radiation for uveal melanoma between 1978 and 1984. RESULTS: After helium ion irradiation, 208 (95.4%) of 218 eyes had local tumor control. Ten years after irradiation, 46 (22.4%) of 218 eyes had been enucleated; the majority of enucleations (37 of 46) resulted from anterior ocular segment complications. Ten years after radiation, 102 (46.8%) of the 218 patients were dead; 51 had non-melanoma-related deaths and 51 had died of metastatic melanoma. Best-corrected visual acuity after radiation was greater than 20/40 in 21 (23%) of 93 eyes of the patients who were alive and who had retained their eyes 10 or more years after treatment. In patients with tumors less than 6 mm in height and more than 3 mm distant from the nerve or the fovea, 13 (72%) of 18 retained visual acuity greater than 20/40. In contrast, only 11% of the patients with either thicker tumors or those close to the nerve or fovea retained that level of visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma is associated with good local tumor control and reasonable retention of the treated eye 10 years after treatment. In eyes with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness and more than 3 mm distant from the optic nerve and fovea, many retain excellent vision

Growth within the initially irradiated volume was documented at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 12 patients. Documented growth occurred in nine of 665 (1.4%) patients with small and intermediate size tumors, at times after treatment ranging from 6 to 48 months (median 16 months), and in three of 341 (.9%) patients with large tumors at 7, 11, and 12 months after treatment. Melanoma growing totally outside the treated volume was also documented in three additional patients at 7, 9, and 45 months; two of these were thought to be "ring melanomas". Eight patients had the treated eye removed elsewhere for suspected tumor growth. The additional treatment in these 23 patients was conservative in nine patients (repeat proton irradiation in five and laser photocoagulation in four). Thirteen underwent immediate enucleation and one had orbital exenteration. Ultimately, 17 of the 23 eyes (74%) were removed. Estimated probability of local control of the melanoma within the irradiated eye at 60 months was 96.3 +/- 1.5%. Dose distributions to the 12 patients with documented local failure within the irradiated volume were analyzed. Ten tumors recurred marginally in an area receiving less than the prescribed dose of 70 CGE (CGE = Cobalt Gray Equivalents = proton Gy X RBE 1.1), whereas only two recurred in the volume receiving full dose. Based on these data, it appears that a dose of 70 CGE in five fractions is associated with very high rates of local control in human uveal melanoma. It is reasonable to consider initiating studies using a lower total dose or a more protracted course, to determine if some of the observed complications are dose-related

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization

Perforated intestines as a late morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy for uterine cancers were examined to reveal the biological characteristics of carbon ion for future applications for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2004, 94 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or corpus were treated with carbon ion therapy. Among them, 9 patients (9.6%) developed major late gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Four out of 9 patients had intestinal perforations excised operatively at our institute. The postoperative clinical courses and histopathological findings of the excised intestine were investigated. RESULTS: Carbon ion irradiation severely damaged smooth muscle layers by coagulation necrosis as well as atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and middle-sized arterial thromboses of the intestines. After evaluating late complications, the dose constraints on the GI tracts were set under 60 GyE to prevent major complications. Thereafter, the incidence of major GI complications markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the characteristic histopathological effects of carbon ion radiotherapy and thus are expected to facilitate future additional applications of carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers

Nine normal subjects were controls. Adenohypophyseal tropic hormones and hydrocortisone were radioimmunoassayed before and after administration of nakom, a dopaminergic agent. ACTH, hydrocortisone, TTH, parlodel secretion were found decreased and LH increased in patients with Itsenko-Cushing's disease, and no STH increase characteristic of normal subjects was observed. During remission after proton therapy adenohypophyseal tropic hormones and hydrocortisone secretion normalized in response to nakom. Recovery of STH secretion was observed, but not in all patients, this being confirmed by the absence of a normal somatotropin response in nakom test in 26.32% of patients

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. RESULTS: At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum. With the use of small-angle lateral-oblique fields in 3D-CPT and IMPT, the rectal V70 was reduced by up to 35% compared with the standard lateral configuration, whereas the bladder V70 increased by less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In the range higher than 60 Gy/CGE, IMRT achieved significantly better sparing of the bladder, whereas rectal sparing was similar with 3D-CPT and IMRT. Dose to healthy tissues in the range lower than 50% of the target prescription was substantially lower with proton therapy

The prognostic significance of tumor grading and pelvic node involvement was analyzed. Five and 10-year survival for Stage B was 100% and 85% respectively; for Stage C it was 68% and 43% respectively. The cumulative 94% local control rate for Stage B and C cases obtained in this report suggests more effectiveness to control the disease locally with acceptable rate of complications, when radioactive gold seed implant is added

[German]	Adenocarcinoma, Aged, Brachytherapy, Combined Modality Therapy, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Incidence, Iodine Radioisotopes, Iodine Radioisotopes/ad [Administration & Dosage], Lymph Node Excision, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Pelvis, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostatic Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Radiation Injuries, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectum, Recurrence, Thigh, Time, Universities	Since the beginning of 1981, 32 patients at an age of 52 to 72 years who suffered from a locally confined adenocarcinoma of the prostate were treated by permanent implantation of iodine-125 seeds at the Urologic and Radiotherapeutic Hospital of the University of Erlangen. 25 patients were evaluated after a median observation period of 30 months. The first group consisting of 19 patients was submitted to a combined percutaneous and interstitial treatment, the other six patients were initially treated only by interstitial therapy because of severe complications observed in the meantime. After bilateral pelvic staging lymphadenectomy, permanent iodine-125 seeds were implanted into the patients of stage T1, T2, early T3, and pN0-1, in case of microscopic lymph node manifestation without capsular perforation also into patients of stage pN2 and pN4. Eight weeks later the patients received a moving beam irradiation with 10 MV photons at the linear accelerator. The centre of the prostate was faded out by a specially constructed H absorber in such a way that the prescribed target dose of 36 Gy in four weeks to the 90%-isodose was only applied to a spherical surface around the implant. One patient died perioperatively from an embolism due to phlebothrombosis of the thigh. 22 out of the other 24 patients are in complete remission, one patient had a local recurrence in the right seminal vesicle which appeared 28 months after primary therapy, and one patient developed skeletal metastases. The objective side effects and late complications of our combined treatment are considerable with respect to their incidence as well as their severity: a slight or medium radioproctitis was found after a latent period of one to two years in 28% (5/18) of cases, after a latent time of about 1 1/2 to two years another 28% (5/18) developed subsequently to a proctitis an urethral stricture and an ulcer situated on the anterior rectum wall facing the prostate, and four patients presented finally a prostato-rectal fistula

The initial results with orthovoltage (280 kV) therapy were unpredictable, but 30 patients with 32 tumors treated with megavoltage radiotherapy (Cobalt-60 [60Co] or linear accelerator) have shown either no evidence of recurrence or complications, with one exception, or died of causes unrelated to their glomus tumor. Megavoltage radiotherapy is recommended for primary treatment of all glomus tumors that present with evidence of bone invasion or nerve involvement

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months). RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age < or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (< or =40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma. Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation. The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS, 5 patients were planned with protons, IMRT, and 3D-CRT plans. The prescribed dose used was 30 fractions x 2.39 Gy for the protons and IMRT and 35 fractions x 2.00 Gy for 3D-CRT. The treatment plans were evaluated using dose volume data and dose response models were used to calculate TCP and NTCP. The target volumes were delineated to spare the parotid glands. A dose escalation was made for protons and IMRT using NTCP constraints to the spinal cord. RESULTS: On average, protons and IMRT increase TCP by 17% compared to 3D-CRT. For the spinal cord NTCP values are zero for all methods and patients. Average NTCP values for the parotid glands were >90% for 3D-CRT and significantly lower for protons and IMRT varying from 43-65%. The average parotid gland dose was 33 Gy for the protons, 38 Gy for IMRT and 48 Gy for 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Protons and IMRT gave a significant TCP increase compared to 3D-CRT while no significant difference between protons and IMRT was found. Protons generally show lower non-target tissue doses, which indicates a possibility for further dose escalation. Large individual dose differences between protons and IMRT for parotid glands indicate that some patients may benefit more from protons and others from IMRT

A total of 39 evaluable patients were treated with curative intent using either fast neutrons alone or in combination with low LET irradiation as part of a mixed beam fractionation scheme. Actuarial survival curves are presented for both the "neutrons alone" and the "mixed beam" treatment groups. There was no significant survival difference between these groups of patients. The projected survival at two years is less than 10%, which is comparable with megavoltage photon results for an unselected series of patients. The size of the primary lesion and the initial Karnofsky performance status were found to be the most important prognostic indications for prolonged survival. Sixteen of 39 patients were felt to have achieved local clearance of their tumor at some time during their follow-up with the median time until a local recurrence being 17 months. Treatment related complications and patterns of metastatic spread are discussed. In general, it appeared that the response of large tumors to neutron irradiation resulted in necrosis and fistula formation. In many cases this was accompanied by persistent/recurrent tumor within the high dose radiation volume

The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease	
0	4663	Proton therapy of uveal melanomas: intercomparison of MRI-based and conventional treatment planning	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Berlin, Eye, Female, Germany, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk, Safety, Tantalum, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton therapy for uveal melanoma provides high-conformal dose application to the target volume and, thus, an optimal saving of the organs at risk nearby. Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

Since July 1983, 57 patients with surgically inaccessible AOVMs of the brain were treated using helium ion (47 patients) or linear accelerator (10 patients) radiosurgery. This study retrospectively evaluates the response of these AOVMs to treatment. METHODS: All patients presented with previous hemorrhage. The mean patient age was 35.6 years (range, 13-71 yr). The mean AOVM volume was 2.25 cm3 (range, 0.080-15.2 cm3), treated with a mean of 18.0 Gy equivalent (physical dose x relative biological effectiveness, which is 1.3 for helium ion Bragg peak) (range, 7.0-40 Gy equivalent). The Drake scale scores before treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (26 patients), and poor (6 patients). The mean follow-up period was 7.5 years (range, 9 mo-13.8 yr). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (32%) bled symptomatically (20 hemorrhages) after radiosurgery. Sixteen hemorrhages occurred within 36 months after radiosurgery (9.4% annual bleed rate; 16 hemorrhages/171 patient yr); 4 hemorrhages occurred more than 36 months after treatment (1.6% annual bleed rate; 4 hemorrhages/257 patient yr) (P < 0.001). Complications included symptomatic radiation edema (four patients, 7%), necrosis (one patient, 2%), and increased seizure frequency (one patient, 2%). Eight patients underwent surgical resection of their AOVMs 8 to 59 months after radiosurgery because of subsequent hemorrhage. The Drake scale scores after treatment were as follows: excellent (25 patients), good (24 patients), poor (3 patients), and dead (5 patients, 3 of whom died as a result of causes unrelated to the AOVMs or radiosurgery). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery may be useful for AOVMs located in surgically inaccessible regions of the brain. A significant decrease in bleed rate exists more than 3 years after treatment compared with the bleed rate within 3 years of treatment. Because current neuroradiological techniques are not able to image obliterative response in these slow-flow vascular lesions, longer term clinical follow-up is required

METHOD: Since 1991, four consecutive patients from our institution with this tumour have been referred for postoperative proton beam radiotherapy. RESULT: We have experienced an unusually high complication rate (50%) of delayed radiation optic neuropathy. This has resulted in profound, bilateral visual loss at 1 and 2 years postproton beam treatment. CONCLUSION: It has served as a reminder that proton beam therapy is not an innocuous treatment option and this devastating complication should be taken into account when discussing the management of clivus chordoma. We postulate whether the optic apparatus is particularly sensitive to proton vs photon damage

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2000, 33 patients with head and neck malignancies but no history of surgical resection were treated with 250-MeV protons with or without X-ray irradiation. This study retrospectively evaluated local control, survival, and treatment sequelae of these patients. The median total target dose using protons with or without X-rays was 76 Gy (range: 42-99 Gy) and the median proton dose per fraction 2.8 Gy (range: 1.5-6.0 Gy). RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival and local control rates were 44% and 74%, respectively. One (3%) and six patients (18%) suffered from treatment-related acute and late toxicity > grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria). One patient with a history of radiotherapy suffered from acute toxicity > grade 3. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy appeared to offer high local control rates with few toxicities relative to conventional radiotherapy. However, late toxicity was seen in areas where large radiation doses had been given

However, this treatment requires a large number of medical personnel, which hinders expanded use of this method. A mobile electron linear accelerator for intraoperative radiation therapy has been developed and is now commercially available. This report analyzes the applicability of this accelerator to colorectal cancer. The applicability of the mobile accelerator is analyzed based on its specifications by simulating the intraoperative radiation therapy delivered to these patients with a conventional intraoperative radiation therapy unit. METHODS: From 1987 to 1999, 49 colorectal cancer patients underwent 54 surgical resections and received intraoperative radiation therapy to 75 sites. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative radiation therapy dose for colorectal cancer with the conventional unit was 22 (range, 10-30) Gy. The mean electron energy level was 10 (range, 3-30) MEV. Applicator size ranged from 4 to 10 cm in diameter. The mobile accelerator can achieve a dose rate of 10 Gy/min and an applicator unit size range of 3 to 10 cm in diameter, facilitating intraoperative radiation therapy for colorectal cancer. The electron energy limitation (12 MEV at maximum) suggests that the indications for this machine are limited. In our experience, 30 percent of patients received intraoperative radiation therapy with electron energy levels exceeding 12 MEV. Of these cases, 81 percent had macroscopic residual tumor and 69 percent had pain. CONCLUSION: An intraoperative radiation therapy mobile accelerator can cover 72 percent of the irradiation sites covered using our conventional unit. This accelerator is useful for intraoperative radiation therapy with curative intent for patients with no or slight residual tumor. Patients with gross residual tumor and pain may not be suitable

Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome	
0	2200	The role of proton therapy in the treatment of large irradiation volumes: a comparative planning study of pancreatic and biliary tumors.[see comment]	Algorithms, Bile Duct Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Bile Duct Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Italy, Kidney, Liver, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Staging, Pancreatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Pancreatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Time, Universities, Vascular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Vascular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vena Cava,Inferior	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefit of proton therapy for abdominal tumors. Extensive comparative planning was conducted investigating the most up-to-date photon and proton irradiation technologies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A number of rival plans were generated for four patients: two inoperable pancreatic tumors, one inoperable and one postoperative biliary duct tumor. The dose prescription goal for these large targets was 50 Gy, followed by a boost dose up to 20 Gy to a smaller planning target volume (PTV). Photon plans were developed using "forward" planning of coplanar and noncoplanar conformal fields and "inverse" planning of intensity-modulated (IM) fields. Proton planning was simulated as administered using the so called spot-scanning technique. Plans were evaluated on the basis of normal tissues' dose-volume constraints (Emami B, Lyman J, Brown A, et al. Tolerance of normal tissue to therapeutic irradiation. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990;21:109-122) and coverage of treatment volumes with prescribed doses. RESULTS: For all cases, none of the forward calculated photon plans was able to deliver 50 Gy to large PTVs at the same time respecting the dose-volume constraints on all critical organs. Nine evenly spaced IM fields achieved or nearly achieved all maximum dose constraints to critical structures for two out of three inoperable patients. IM plans also obtained good results for the postoperative patient, even though the dose to the liver was very close to the maximum allowed. In all cases, photon irradiation of large PTV1s to 50 Gy followed by a 20 Gy boost entailed a risk very close to or higher than 5% for serious complications to the kidneys, liver, or bowel. Simple arrangements of 2, 3, and 4 proton fields obtained better dose conformation to the target, allowing the delivery of planned doses including the boost to all patients, without excessive risk of morbidity. Dose homogeneity inside the targets was also superior with protons. CONCLUSION: For the irradiation of large PTVs located in the abdominal cavity, where multiple, parallel structured organs surround the target volumes, proton therapy, delivered with a sophisticated isocentric technique, has the potential to achieve superior dose distributions compared with state-of-the-art photon irradiation techniques. IM photon plans obtain better results in the postoperative case, because the reduced volume lessens the effect of the unavoidable increase of integral dose to surrounding tissues

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with a Ewing sarcoma was selected for the model study. The proton boost plan was realised with a six beam patched technique. Several X-ray boost techniques were planned, some not yet practically realisable. The techniques giving the best dose distributions and the best tumour control probabilities in the absence of significant late toxicity were looked for. The boost techniques were added to two large lateral X-ray beams covering the planning target volume (PTV) and the main risk organ, the spinal cord. The evaluation was made with two biological models, i.e. the tumour control probability (TCP) model, proposed by Webb and Nahum (Webb, S. and Nahum, A.E. A model for calculating tumour control probability in radiotherapy including the effect of inhomogeneous distributions of dose and clonogenic cell density. Phys. Med. Biol. 38: 653-666, 1993), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, first derived by Lyman (Lyman, J.T. Complication probability as assessed from dose-volume histograms. Radiat. Res. 104: s13-s19, 1985). RESULTS: The comparison showed small but clear advantages of protons for the boost. At 1% NTCP in the spinal cord, the calculated TCP was on average 5% higher. However, depending on the values of the parameters chosen in the biological models, the gain for protons varied from 0-10%. The smallest gains were seen in radiosensitive tumours for which the TCP was close to 100% with any of the techniques and in radioresistant tumours for which neither technique resulted in any appreciable probability of local cure. CONCLUSION: Protons appear to have therapeutic advantages over conventional radiotherapy in tumours with relatively high radiosensitivity situated close to the spinal cord

[Spanish]	Adolescent, Child, Child,Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Intraoperative Care, Intraoperative Care/mt [Methods], Male, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Risk	Conventional external beam radiation has proved its profit in pediatric tumors; but its complications have limited it in therapeutical approach. Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases

The role of radiation therapy (RT) and dose levels required to improve tumor control are poorly defined. This study reviews our experience with RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent fractionated RT for atypical (AM, 15 patients) or malignant meningioma (MM, 16 patients) of the cranium. Sixteen patients presented with primary and 15 with recurrent disease. Eight patients received RT following total resection, 21 patients after subtotal resection and 2 patient following biopsy only. RT was given using megavoltage photons in 15 patients and combined photons and 160 MeV protons in 16 patients. Total target doses ranged from 50 to 68 (AM, mean 62) and from 40 to 72 (MM, mean 58) Gy or CGE (= cobalt-gray-equivalent). RESULTS: With mean observation time of 59 months (range: 7-155 months) actuarial local control rates at 5- and 8-years were similar for both histologies (38% and 19% for AM and 52 and 17% for MM). However, significantly improved local control was observed for proton versus photon RT (80% versus 17% at 5 years, p = 0.003) and target doses > or = 60 Gy for both, atypical (p = 0.025) and malignant meningioma (p = 0.0006). At time of analysis, 14/15 patients (93%) with AM and 6/16 (38%) with MM were alive. Three patients (19%) with MM developed distant metastasis. Actuarial 5- and 8-year survival rates for MM were significantly improved by use of proton over photon RT and radiation doses > 60 CGE. Three patients developed symptomatic radiation damage after 59.3, 68.4 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, high dose RT resulted in significant improvement of local control for atypical and malignant meningiomas. Increased local control resulted also in improved rates of survival for patients with malignant meningioma

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article reviews the limited experiences on splenic irradiation in autoimmune thrombocytopenia by analyzing the current studies including 71 patients and some preliminary reports on splenic irradiation in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. RESULTS: In autoimmune thrombocytopenia between 40 and 90% of all patients responded, but most of them relapsed within 4 to 6 months after splenic irradiation. Between 10 and 20% of all patients had a sustained response. The efficacy of splenic irradiation in HIV-associated cases of thrombocytopenia is probably lower than in other forms of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, but especially in this group immunosuppressive drug treatment of autoimmune thrombocytopenia exposes some problems. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia there are some case reports about efficacy of splenic irradiation. Toxicity of splenic irradiation in both diseases was very moderate. CONCLUSIONS: For HIV patients, for elderly patients or patients at high risk for complications following splenectomy splenic irradiation might be a treatment option. Splenic irradiation as preoperative treatment in patients not responding to or not suitable for immunosuppressive drugs prior to splenectomy may be a promising new application of splenic irradiation to reduce adverse effects of splenectomy in thrombocytopenic patients. A further analysis of the biological mechanisms underlying splenic irradiation may help to improve patient selection, to optimize dose concepts and treatment schedules and will improve understanding of radiotherapy as an immunomodulatory treatment modality.

Protons have favorable physical characteristics which allow the delivery of high doses of radiation to these critically located tumors. The methods employed for these treatments are described. These patients have been followed for at least 17 months and for a median of 34 months. The median tumor dose was 69 CGE (cobalt Gy equivalent): CGE is the dose in proton Gy multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons compared to cobalt-60. The daily dose was 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. For this group the 5-year actuarial local control rate is 82% and disease-free survival rate is 76%. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity has been acceptable

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 2001, AFR was used to treat 36 patients with advanced stage primary (n=33) or recurrent (n=3) nasal or paranasal malignant tumors. Full ophthalmologic follow-up was documented. The median dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 69.6 CGE (range 60.8-77). Visual complications were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and the late effects of normal tissue (LENT) scoring systems. The median follow-up was 52.4 months (range 17-122.8). RESULTS: Thirteen patients developed late visual/ocular toxicity. Cataracts were LENT grade 1 and 3 in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One LENT grade 1 vascular retinopathy and 1 optic neuropathy were also observed. Three and five patients presented with nasolacrimal duct stenosis (CTC grade 2, 2 patients; CTC grade 3, 1 patient) and dry-eye syndrome (CTC grade 1, 1 patient; CTC grade 2, 4 patients), respectively. The 3- and 5-year probability of LENT/CTC grade > or =2 visual toxicity were 15.8+/-6.7% and 20.7+/-7.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AFR for locally advanced nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors enables delivery of 70 CGE to the tumor with acceptable ophthalmologic complications

We studied these changes in the temporal lobe in six patients, following radiosurgery on the amygdala and hippocampus. (1)H MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T with short and long echo times (TE=10 and 135 ms) were used together with standard MR imaging sequences (T1-, T2-weighted). The treatment was performed by Leksell Gamma Knife with a dose of 50 Gy to the center and a 50% isodose to the margin of the target, represented by the mean volume of approximately 7.5 ml. Magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy examinations were performed at least once per year for 3 years. The most significant changes in spectra were observed approximately 1 year after the irradiation when edema in irradiated area was observed and strong signal of lipids was identified. Later, edema and lipid signals disappeared and follow-up was characterized by a decrease of NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations in the ipsilateral region of the brain to the irradiation (LCModel calculation from voxel of interest 3.8-4.5 ml positioned into the centrum of target volume). The concentration of NAA, Cr, and Cho after radiosurgery was significantly different from control values ( p<0.05) and also from concentrations in the contralateral part of the brain ( p<0.05). In the contralateral part, the concentration of NAA was significantly increased ( p<0.05) (NAA: before treatment 8.81, after treatment 11.33 mM). No radiotoxic changes were observed in the contralateral part of the brain or behind the area of target volume. The MR spectroscopy findings precluded MRI observation and MRS results completed data about the development of radiotoxic changes in the target volume

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices

The proton beam presents physical characteristics that enable such high-dose irradiation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to answer whether or not the proton beam can provide useful treatment for cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Five primary melanomas (4 acral lentiginous and 1 superficial spreading type) and 3 metastatic lymph nodes of 3 different patients were irradiated using the proton beam with a total dose of around 100 Gy fractionated into single doses of approximately 10 Gy. RESULTS: All the macular lesions and a tumor lesion of primary melanoma disappeared completely, and other tumor lesions regressed by 80-90%. The 3 metastatic lymph nodes also regressed by 50-90%. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma

These data were compared with those measured in normal pituitary glands obtained from four cats and seven fresh human cadavers. The T1 and T2 measured at 24 degrees C in the tumors (mean +/- SD: 1,170 +/- 80 and 123 +/- 35 ms, respectively) were significantly higher than those of cadaver pituitary (830 +/- 200 and 76 +/- 12 ms) and cat pituitary gland (790 +/- 120 and 69 +/- 10 ms). Although the absolute values were lower, similar differences were present in T1 measured at 4 degrees C. Two-dimensional T2 versus T1 plot was particularly helpful in distinguishing tumor from the normal gland. When tumors were grouped according to density on CT, histology or previous treatment (e.g., irradiation or bromocriptine), there were no significant differences in T1 values between the groups. Bound water content was not found to correlate with T1 or T2 values. We concluded that pituitary adenomas can be distinguished from normal pituitary glands by their different relaxation properties when measured at high frequency in vitro MR

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable	
0	4278	[Field localization and verification system for proton beam radiotherapy in deep-seated tumors]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Humans, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Skin, Universities	It has been recognized that, for precise localization and verification of radiation fields, a marking drawn on the skin surface is not entirely reliable because its position relative to bony structures or internal organs is not stationary. This is especially true when treating deep-seated tumors located below the clavicle. In proton beam radiotherapy at the University of Tsukuba, we ristrict the margins around the target volume. Therefore, special care in field localization and verification is needed, and we make it a rule to take X-ray pictures on each treatment day. To accomplish this, we have developed a localize-and-verify system by using fluoroscopic techniques and combining it with a real-time digital image processing device. This allows for the formation of a digital image of the proton field and storage it in the optic disc. By using this system as well as verification films, filed placement errors were measured in 10 patients with deep-seated tumors. Out of a total of 190 localizations, 22% exhibited a field placement error of more than 5 mm, where patient positioning and field localization were done by using skin drawings aligned with laser beams. This result strongly suggests the necessity for daily localization and verification of radiation fields, as is being done by us, for precision in the execution of proton beam radiation therapy	
0	1110	The efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of intracranial ependymoma	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Disease-Free Survival, Ependymoma/mo [Mortality], Ependymoma/pp [Physiopathology], Ependymoma/su [Surgery], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/ae [Adverse Effects], Retrospective Studies, Salvage Therapy, Survival	OBJECTIVE: A retrospective analysis was performed to determine the outcome of patients with intracranial ependymoma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: Nine ependymoma patients have been treated with SRS (four with linear accelerator and five with Gamma Knife) since 1990. Two patients had WHO grade III tumors, and the remaining seven had WHO grade II tumors. Eight of nine patients received external beam radiation therapy at some point prior to radiosurgery to a total median dose of 54 Gy. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 14 to 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 35 years. Four patients developed progressive disease following radiosurgery, and two patients have died of progressive disease. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 55.6%. The 3-year overall survival was 71.1%. Patients treated with radiosurgery as a component of initial treatment (generally as a boost following external beam) had an improved relapse-free survival (100%) compared to those treated with radiosurgery to salvage an external beam local failure (20%). CONCLUSION: SRS is an effective treatment for intracranial ependymoma. Further clinical trials are warranted incorporating radiosurgery as a component of initial management in selected ependymoma patients

Since 1989, 55 patients with cranial base meningiomas were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator radiosurgery. An analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of this patient population was the focus of this study. METHODS: The mean patient age was 55.1 years (range, 28-82 yr). The mean tumor volume was 7.33 cm3 (range, 0.45-27.65 cm3). The radiation dose averaged 18.3 Gy (range, 12-25 Gy), delivered with an average of 2.2 isocenters (range, 1-5). Patients were evaluated retrospectively through clinic notes from follow-up examinations, and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging studies. The length of follow-up averaged 48.4 months (range, 17-81 mo). RESULTS: Tumor stabilization after radiosurgery was noted in 38 patients (69%), shrinkage in 16 patients (29%), and enlargement in only 1 patient (2%). The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast uptake in 11 meningiomas (20%), possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel obliteration. Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series (27%) and unchanged in 34 patients (62%). Three patients (5%) died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor progression. Three patients (5%) developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right hemiparesis, and one patient with both vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsy). All other complications were transient, including partial trigeminal nerve palsy in seven patients and diplopia in three patients. The 2-year actuarial tumor control rate was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that radiosurgery can be used to ablate selected small cranial base meningiomas, with good clinical results and modest morbidity	
1	2685	Fractionated radiotherapy of small inoperable lesions of the brain using a non-invasive stereotactic frame	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, France, Head, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/rt [Radiotherapy], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Stereotaxic Techniques, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry	Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and benign or low grade, small malignant tumors can be treated by stereotactic radiotherapy in a single fraction. This report describes a technique for stereotactic treatment of small lesions using conventional, fractionated, photon beam irradiation. The Laitinen's stereoadapter, non-invasive head frame was used. This device was tested for accuracy by serial mountings and found to be accurate within 1 mm. The accuracy of the dose delivered was within 2%. Adaptation of this device to the linear accelerator required the design of secondary circular collimators which decreased the penumbra from 3-4 mm to 2-3 mm. The dose fall off outside the target volume is steep enough when using two non-coplanar arcs (90 to 10% within 1 cm). Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) in a humanoid phantom showed good correlation with the calculated dose. This system permits delivery of fractionated radiation therapy to small volumes, easily and accurately, under stereotactic conditions

Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients between 1990 and 2005 with the diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancer was performed. Of 125 total patients new onset urothelial carcinoma developed in 11 after undergoing external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy with a proton boost to the prostate was the radiation modality in 7 of the 11 patients (64%), while the remaining 4 patients received standard external beam radiation only. Urothelial carcinoma was detected a mean of 3.07 years after completion of radiation therapy in the proton group, compared to a mean latency period of 5.75 years in the standard radiation group (p = 0.09). Average patient age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 64 to 84). All patients presented with gross hematuria and had cystoscopic findings of coexisting radiation cystitis. Of the 11 patients 5 (45%) presented with grade 3 carcinoma and eventually 7 (64%) required radical cystectomy. Urothelial tumors with sarcomatoid features (carcinosarcoma and spindle cell sarcomatoid) developed in 2 patients (18%). Of the 11 patients 10 (91%) were nonsmokers at the time of urothelial carcinoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma in patients with previous radiation therapy for prostate cancer is often high grade, and the majority of patients have cancer progression requiring cystectomy. A high incidence of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features was seen in these patients

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

The authors report the results of treatment of 10 patients, six with chordoma, three with chondrosarcoma, and one with a neurofibrosarcoma. Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed	
1	3550	Proton therapy for pediatric cranial tumors: preliminary report on treatment and disease-related morbidities	Adolescent, Aged, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/co [Complications], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Child, Child,Preschool, Disease Progression, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Medical Records, Methods, Morbidity, Physical Examination, Pituitary Neoplasms/co [Complications], Pituitary Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted, Research, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Seizures/et [Etiology], Universities	PURPOSE: Accelerated protons were used in an attempt to limit treatment-related morbidity in children with tumors in or near the developing brain, by reducing the integral dose to adjacent normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children treated with protons at Loma Linda University Medical Center between August 1991 and December 1994 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight children, aged 1 to 18 years, were identified as at risk for brain injury from treatment. Medical records, physical examinations, and correspondence with patients, their parents, and referring physicians were analyzed. The investigators tabulated post-treatment changes in pre-treatment signs and symptoms and made judgments as to whether improvement, no change, or worsening related to disease or treatment had supervened. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with clinical findings and radiographic impressions were tabulated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 7 to 49 months (median 25 months). Four instances of treatment-related morbidity were identified. Forty-one instances of site-specific, disease-related morbidity were identified: 15 improved or resolved and 26 remained unchanged after treatment. Four patients had radiographic evidence of local failure. Three of these patients, including two with high-grade glioma, have died. CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related morbidity associated with proton therapy is low. Tumor progression remains a problem when treating certain histologies such as high-grade glioma. Escalating the dose delivered to target volumes may benefit children with tumors associated with poor rates of local control. Long-term follow-up, including neurocognitive testing, is in progress to assess integral-dose effects on cognitive, behavioral and developmental outcomes in children with cranial tumors

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study

The localisation and locally-destructive growth require a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic concept early on. The goal of the present study was to present a reproducible strategy for quality assurance. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the hospital records of 10 consecutive patients (4 women and 6 men) whom we had treated during a period of 7 years. RESULTS: The first step in therapy was tumour resection in 9 cases. One patient initially underwent stereotactic radiation. Postoperative radiation was not included a priori, but discussed individually depending on the degree of resection, the patient's age and physical condition. After an average 5 years follow up, 100 % of patients are alive. In all patients, tumour control was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with chordomas of the skull base has improved considerably in recent years. New technologies like intraoperative navigation and improved radiation procedures have contributed to this improvement. The basis for treatment remains, however, the greatest possible surgical exstirpation with minimal surgical morbidity. Special attention should be paid in this connection to the stability of the cervical spine and the craniocervical transition border. In advanced tumour growth, complete resection is often not possible. Proton and heavy-ion radiation are promising new forms of therapy, which can also be applied after conventional radiation has been performed. A directed multidisciplinary procedure guarantees years of survival with good quality of life in many cases

On the basis on the results, a phase II study using a regimen of four fractions during 1 week was performed. The purpose of the present study was to determine the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2003, 79 patients with 80 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA NSCLC and 60.0 GyE for stage IB NSCLC in four fractions during 1 week, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.8 years. Sixty-two (78.5%) of these patients were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The data were statistically processed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years or until death, with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months, ranging from 2.5 to 72.2 months. The local control rate for all patients was 90% (T1: 98%, T2: 80%). The patients' 5-year lung cancer-specific survival rate was 68% (IA: 87%, IB: 42%). The overall survival was 45% (IA: 62%, IB: 25%). Half of the deaths were attributable to intercurrent diseases. No toxic reactions in the lung greater than grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion beam radiotherapy with a regimen of four fractions during 1 week has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients

A phase-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence was used to determine the temperature-related phase shifts during LITT. Temperature maps were displayed during therapy with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. Irradiation was discontinued as soon as the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm reached the margin of the tumor. A contrast-enhanced MRI study performed immediately after therapy showed a good correlation of the size of an enhancing rim around the lesion with the 60 to 65 degrees C isotherm. The preliminary results of our study indicate that MRI guidance of LITT may be improved by temperature quantification based on the proton-resonance-frequency method

We present a study on five patients receiving loco-regional treatment for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose variation at the junction was measured with the patient dose verification system model TN-RD-50 (MOSFET system). Phantom measurements were performed to investigate the MOSFET accuracy in a half-field matching method and the influence of factors related to the accelerator. The aim of the patient measurements was to determine the effect of patient related factors on the dose at the junction over a period of 10 irradiation fractions. RESULTS: The MOSFET detector overestimates the dose in the junction area, therefore a correction factor was determined to correct the MOSFET results. Phantom measurements showed overdosages as well as underdosages, depending on the matching field direction (X or Y). Patient measurements showed dose values that deviated up to 133%+/-3% (2 S.D.). The average values of 10 irradiation sessions showed a continuous, almost linear, variation of dose value across the junction. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Significant dose deviations in the junction area average out over repeated treatments; (2) one individual measurement in the junction area should not lead to any action; (3) a linac QA procedure to check the dose at the junction line should simulate the clinical situation sufficiently; and (4) MOSFET dosimeters overestimate dose values in the penumbra region

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At HIMAC, relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) values of therapeutic carbon beams were determined based on experimental results of cell responses, on values expected with the linear-quadratic model, and based on experiences with neutron therapy. We use fixed RBE values independent of dose levels, although this apparently contradicts radiobiologic observations. Our RBE system depends only on LET of the heavy-ion radiation fields. With this RBE system, over 2,000 patients have been treated by carbon beams. With data from these patients, the local control rate of non-small-cell lung cancer was analyzed to verify the clinical RBE of the carbon beam. The local control rate was compared with rates published by groups from Gunma University and Massachusetts General Hospital. Using a simplified tumor control probability (TCP) model, clinical RBE values were obtained for different levels of TCP. RESULTS: For the 50% level of the clinical TCP, the RBE values nearly coincide with those for in vitro human salivary gland cell survival at 10%. For the higher levels of clinical TCP, the RBE values approach closer to those adapted in clinical trials at HIMAC

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function	
0	1607	Neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands	Adenocarcinoma, Adenoma,Pleomorphic/rt [Radiotherapy], Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cyclotrons, Humans, Liver, Lung, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Risk, Salivary Gland Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Analysis, Survival Rate, Survivors, Time	INTRODUCTION: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common neoplasm arising in the salivary glands. Surgical management is the primary therapeutic modality. With the use of modern surgical techniques, recurrence is infrequent, and facial nerve sparing is the norm. However, for patients with recurrent disease, the risk of further relapses is increased with surgical resection alone, particularly for those patients in whom multiple recurrences have already occurred. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting remains uncertain. Although neutron radiotherapy is superior to conventional radiotherapy for malignant salivary gland tumors, its role in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas is less well defined. We report our experience using this modality for high-risk, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. METHODS: Sixteen patients were treated with neutron radiotherapy for recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of major salivary glands from 1986 through 1993. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11-77 years); median age at the time of neutron radiotherapy was 52 years (range, 22-77 years); median number of prior surgical procedures was 3 (range, 1-6); median duration from initial diagnosis to radiotherapy was 14.5 years (range, 3 months-30 years); median follow-up was 83 months (range, 9-144 months). The median period at risk for survivors was 96 months (defined as the interval from completion of neutron radiotherapy to last follow-up). Ten patients had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment as determined by imaging studies, with nine patients having multinodular disease. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial survival was 79%. One patient died from lung metastases 9 months after treatment; one patient died from a liver tumor of uncertain origin, but the histology could not rule out a metastasis from the previous pleomorphic adenoma; and one patient died from recurrent disease at the base of skull. The 15-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 85%. One of the two patients with locoregional recurrence had a malignant transformation into an adenocarcinoma. No statistical difference in 15-year actuarial survival (75% vs 83%, p =.82) was found comparing patients with gross residual disease vs microscopic residual disease. The actuarial 15-year locoregional control was 76% for patients with gross residual disease vs 100% for those with microscopic disease. The 15-year actuarial risk of RTOG/ESTRO nonaudiologic grade III/IV complications was 21%. No facial nerve injuries were observed as a direct consequence of neutron radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron radiotherapy offers both excellent local control rates and survival rates in patients with multiply recurrent pleomorphic adenomas that are not candidates for surgical resection, even in the presence of gross residual disease. The treatment-related morbidity is acceptable. Malignant transformations and metastases, although uncommon, may be observed in this tumor. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc	
0	1317	Optimization of radiation therapy for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas with infiltration of the skull base using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a carbon ion boost	Carbon, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Ethmoid Sinus, Germany, Humans, Ions, Jaw Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lead, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

Our method uses a modified Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRS), CT-guided, stereotactic system and a 6 MV linear accelerator equipped with a special collimator (diameters of 12.5 mm to 30.0 mm projected to isocenter) located 23 cm from isocenter. Target localization via planar angiography has been added. Treatment consists of a series of arcing beams using both gantry and couch rotations. During treatment, the patient's head is immobilized independently of the radiotherapy couch and is precisely positioned without reference to room lasers or light field. A precise verification of alignment precedes each treatment. Extensive performance tests have shown that a target, localized by CT, can be irradiated with a positional accuracy of 2.4 mm in any direction with 95% confidence. If angiography is used for localization, the results are better. The dose 1.0 cm outside the target volume is less than 20% of the prescribed dose for a medium sized collimator

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed

Twenty-eight patients with cilio-choroidal melanoma were involved in the study, 7 male and 21 female ones, aged 48.4 on an average. The authors' findings evidence that postradiation changes in the anterior segment of the eye, resulting from radiation iridocyclitis, are mainly responsible for the development of secondary glaucoma. Preliminary laser-effected formation of iridal coloboma is conducive to a normal flow in the anterior chamber at the expense of an additional pupil functioning and thus helps reduce the possibility of secondary glaucoma development by 1.6 times (or by 38.5%)

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1066-1070

METHODS: A 75-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having a choroidal melanoma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a hot spot in the same location as the intraocular mass seen in MRI. Carbon ion radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 77 Gy, and the hot spot seen by PET disappeared completely. At 15 months after carbon ion therapy, the eye had to be enucleated because of uncontrollable ocular hypertension. It was examined histologically in serial sections. RESULTS: A large tumor mass (15 x 12 mm) with high pigmentation was found in the vitreous space. Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis in every section. A small number of intact tumor cells were present at the periphery. The overlying retina did not show any necrosis, but showed mild to moderate gliosis. No intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid deposit, or protein exudate was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all tumor cells showed necrosis after radiotherapy with a carbon ion beam. However, the effect on the adjacent tissues was determined as minimal in histological analysis

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1975 and October 1993, 204 patients were treated for chordoma of the base of skull or cervical spine, of which 63 have developed relapse. These 63 patients constitute the main focus of this study. Forty-five patients presented with base of skull and 18 with cervical spine tumors. All patients received combined proton and photon beam radiation. The median prescribed dose was 70.1 cobalt-Gray equivalent (CGE) (range 66.6-77.4). There were 25 males and 38 females, with a median age of 41 years (range 7-66). Median follow-up was 54 months (range 8-158). RESULTS: Sixty-three of the 204 patients treated (31%) had treatment failure. Among the 63 patients who relapsed, 60 (95%) experienced local recurrence, and in 49 patients (78%), this was the only site of failure. Two of 63 patients (3%) developed regional lymph node relapse and 3 of 63 (5%) developed surgical pathway recurrence (1 left neck, 1 palate and 1 nasal cavity). Thirteen of 204 patients relapsed in distant sites, accounting for 20% (13 of 63) of all patients with recurrence in this series. The most common metastatic sites were lungs and bones presenting in 7 of 13 and 6 of 13 patients, respectively. Only 2 of 13 patients failed with isolated distant metastasis. The actuarial 3- and 5-year survival rates after local relapse (60 patients) were 44 and 5%, respectively. Following distant failure (13 patients), the 3- and 5-year survival rates were 25 and 12%, respectively. After any relapse (63 patients) the corresponding survival rates were 43 and 7%. Following local relapse, 49 of 60 patients underwent salvage therapy consisting of subtotal resection in most patients (46 of 49). The remaining 11 of 60 patients received supportive care only. Salvage therapy resulted in stable or improved status without subsequent disease progression in 26 of 49 (53%), and progressive disease in 16 of 49 patients (33%). The actuarial 2- and 5-year overall survival rates following relapse for the 49 patients who underwent salvage treatment were 63 and 6%, which favorably compared to the 2-year survival rate of 21% for those who received supportive care only (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Local relapse is the predominant type of treatment failure for chordomas of the base of skull and cervical spine. Salvage treatment may relieve symptoms; however, most patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Poor long-term survival rates following relapse emphasize the importance of a combined treatment approach with experienced surgeons and radiation oncologists at the time of primary treatment. For most patients, only permanent local tumor control will offer a chance of cure

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 51 NSCLC patients were treated with proton beams at the University of Tsukuba. There were 28 patients in Stage I, 9 in Stage II, 8 in Stage III, 1 in Stage IV, and 5 with recurrent disease. Thirty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 17 had adenocarcinoma, and 1 had large-cell carcinoma. Median fraction and total doses given were 3.0 Gy (range 2.0-6.0 Gy), and 76.0 Gy (range 49.0-93.0 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 29% for all patients, 70% for 9 Stage IA patients, and 16% for 19 Stage IB patients, respectively (IA vs. IB: p < 0.05). The 5-year in-field local control rate was higher in patients with Stage IA (89%) when compared with those with Stage IB (39%). Forty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute lung toxicity of Grade 1 or less; 3 had Grade 2, 1 had Grade 3, and none experienced Grade 4 or higher. Patients in the present series showed very little late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is a very safe and effective treatment for patients with NSCLC, especially for those with early stages. The relative merit of proton therapy in comparison with stereotactic photon radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy remains to be defined through future clinical trials

Thirty-eight had major surgery before or after irradiation. Major complications (fistula formation, carotid artery exposure or blowout requiring ligation, or major wound breakdown) occurred in 37%. The complication rates associated with surgery prior to irradiation, planned surgery following irradiation, and salvage surgery following irradiation were 0/12, 4/5, and 10/21, respectively. The complication rate for surgery following neutron irradiation alone was 73%; for surgery following mixed-beam irradiation it was 20%. The age of the patient and the interval between surgery and irradiation had no influence on the complication rate	
1	3242	[Clinical investigation of indications in proton therapy]. [Japanese]	Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy, Skin Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Tongue Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities, Uterine Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The indications for curative treatment with proton therapy were investigated by the clinical results of 31 cancer patients treated with proton beams between 1983 and 1985 at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center of Tsukuba University. Many locally extended, radioresistant lesions, lesions with large volume and small radiocurable lesions in this series revealed sufficient improvement without definite late damage in the surrounding normal tissues. This clinical result suggests that proton beam treatment could be applied to lesions in a much wider range for curative purposes as compared with conventional radiotherapy. This study is to be continued further

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and December 1999, 17 patients received a treatment by 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO) for a meningioma. Five patients presented a histologically atypical or malignant meningioma, twelve patients a benign one that was recurrent or rapidly progressive. In two cases radiotherapy was administered in the initial course of the disease and in 15 cases at the time of relapse. A highly conformal approach was used combining high-energy photons and protons for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of the total dose. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume was 61 Cobalt Gray Equivalent CGE (25-69). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 37 months (17-60). The 4-year local control and overall survival rates were 87.5 +/- 12% and 88.9 +/- 11%, respectively. One patient failed locally within the clinical tumor volume. One patient died of intercurrent disease. A complete or partial clinical improvement was seen in most of patients. Radiologically, there were eleven stable diseases and five partial responses. In 12/15 recurrent cases, the free interval after radiotherapy is longer than that achieved by the initial surgery. This radiotherapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In both benign and more aggressive meningiomas, the combination of conformal photons and protons with a dose escalated by 10-15% offers clinical improvements in most patients as well as radiological long-term stabilization	
0	639	Proton radiotherapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcome and a dosimetric comparison with photons	Brain/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Child,Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Massachusetts, Orbital Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Rhabdomyosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Over 85% of pediatric orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are cured with combined chemotherapy and radiation. However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects

The data were collected in 1984-1985 by the Patterns of Care Study Survey of Palliative Care conducted in 49 institutions selected to provide valid national averages for the practice patterns reported. Data were collected from 784 patient records selected from five "strata" of practice. Demographic data and process data were tabulated and national averages were calculated from the data. Four metastatic sites were selected, weight bearing bones (401), non-weight bearing bones (102), brain metastasis (224), and lung-mediastinum (57). The median patient age was 63 years, equally divided by sex. In 52% of patients this was the first metastasis. Common Karnofsky performance scores ranged from 40 to 80%. Lung, breast, and prostate were the most common primaries. Two-thirds of the patients were treated by linear accelerators, one-third by cobalt. The median number of fractions was 10, median dose 3000 cGy, median fraction size 300 cGy, and median treatment duration 15 days. The goal of treatment was relief of pain (98%) and return of function (30%) for weight bearing bones, for brain metastasis it was preservation of function (68%), pain relief (33%), and relief of compression (25%). All sites showed TDF values that ranged from 33-85, and a TDF of approximately 65 was most common for weight bearing bones and brain metastasis with no consistent pattern of TDF selection for the other sites. Compliance by strata of practice with work-up criteria was excellent with isolated poor compliance seen in several strata	
0	1071	Accounting for center-of-mass target motion using convolution methods in Monte Carlo-based dose calculations of the lung	Body Burden, Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/ra [Radiography], Models,Biological, Models,Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Motion, Movement, Probability, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiographic Image Interpretation,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Reproducibility of Results, Research, Respiratory Mechanics, Sensitivity and Specificity, Statistics as Topic, Time	We have applied convolution methods to account for some of the effects of respiratory induced motion in clinical treatment planning of the lung. The 3-D displacement of the GTV center-of-mass (COM) as determined from breath-hold exhale and inhale CT scans was used to approximate the breathing induced motion. The time-course of the GTV-COM was estimated using a probability distribution function (PDF) previously derived from diaphragmatic motion [Med. Phys. 26, 715-720 (1990)] but also used by others for treatment planning in the lung [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 53, 822-834 (2002); Med. Phys. 30, 1086-1095 (2003)]. We have implemented fluence and dose convolution methods within a Monte Carlo based dose calculation system with the intent of comparing these approaches for planning in the lung. All treatment plans in this study have been calculated with Monte Carlo using the breath-hold exhale CT data sets. An analysis of treatment plans for 3 patients showed substantial differences (hot and cold spots consistently greater than +/- 15%) between the motion convolved and static treatment plans. As fluence convolution accounts for the spatial variance of the dose distribution in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities, the doses were approximately 5% greater than those calculated with dose convolution in the vicinity of the lung. DVH differences between the static, fluence and dose convolved distributions for the CTV were relatively small, however, larger differences were observed for the PTV. An investigation of the effect of the breathing PDF asymmetry on the motion convolved dose distributions showed that reducing the asymmetry resulted in increased hot and cold spots in the motion convolved distributions relative to the static cases. In particular, changing from an asymmetric breathing function to one that is symmetric results in an increase in the hot/cold spots of +/- 15% relative to the static plan. This increase is not unexpected considering that the target spends relatively more time at inhale as the asymmetry decreases (note that the treatment plans were generated using the exhale CT scans)

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) plans were designed for nine patients using the CORVUS treatment planning system (NOMOS Corp.). These plans were delivered using a tertiary collimator dedicated for serial tomotherapy attached to a 10-MV linear accelerator. For each patient, one optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) was placed on the sternum and one on the lower abdomen. The OSLDs were then processed, thereby estimating the in vivo absorbed doses to the sternum and gonads as a function of distance from the treatment site. RESULTS: The OSLDs were shown to measure known doses to within 5%, thereby validating their accuracy for this dose and energy range. In the patient studies, the dose received by the OSLDs varied in direct proportion to the number of monitor units delivered and inversely with the distance from the target volume; the patient dose at a distance of 15 cm from the target is approximately 0.4% of the total monitor units delivered, and drops to below 0.1% of the total MUs at approximately 40 cm from the center of the target. The average sternal dose was 1353 mSv and the average abdominal dose was 327 mSv for an average prescribed dose of 60.1 Gy. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the inefficient treatment delivery that on average required 9.9 MU/0.01 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: While IMRT reduces the normal tissue volume in the high-dose region, it also increases the overall monitor units delivered, and hence the whole-body dose, when compared with conventional treatment delivery. As has been noted in existing literature, these increases in whole-body dose from radiotherapy delivery may increase the likelihood of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of secondary malignancies from IMRT delivery, and compare this relative risk against the potential benefits of decreased normal tissue complication probabilities

The most effective approaches to therapy of oropharyngeal tumors with account of their site, spread and degrees of differentiation were developed. The most effective method was shown to be the combination of gamma-beam therapy (50 Gy) with electron-photon radiation (20 Gy) of an accelerator of 18-20 MeV, radiation exposure of normal tissues being lowered by approximately 10-20% as compared to that in gamma-beam therapy used alone. The use of the above method in 45 oropharyngeal cancer patients resulted in an immediate clinical effect (disappearance of a tumor and regional metastases (if any) in 60% of the patients. The 2-year survival rate calculated by actuarial curves, was 62 +/- 10%

The latter was mainly a result of partial irradiation of pituitary adenoma. Some patients after proton irradiation demonstrated signs of adenohypophyseal functional insufficiency, more marked in patients with a decreased level of Gy (over 5 ng/ml). A conclusion is that proton beam therapy is effective (provided all criteria for patients' eligibility are observed) and can be used as an independent method for the treatment of acromegalic patients

Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64% and 84%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90% and 95%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study

The patient retained 6/7.5 visual acuity for 2 1/2 years before he was killed in an automobile accident. The eye was ruptured at the time of death; however, histopathologic examination of the eye revealed no residual tumor. The residual ocular mass was composed of eosinophilic amorphous material and macrophages. Necropsy failed to reveal any evidence of metastasis at the time of death. Helium ion charged-particle irradiation in this case was able to completely eradicate the tumor while preserving useful vision	
1	2420	Current developments in proton therapy: a review. [Review] [85 refs]	Engineering, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Physics, Protons, Radiobiology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The use of high-energy protons in radiotherapy was first proposed in 1946. In the last decade there has been a significant growth in the number of centres using protons in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disease. To date (January 1993) a total of more than 11,500 patients have been treated world-wide. Encouraging clinical results have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this article is to outline the advantages of proton beams and to review current developments in physics and engineering applied to the field of proton therapy with particular emphasis on proton accelerator technology and the development of proton therapy facilities. The production of clinically useful beams is discussed and the relative merits of different treatment systems compared. Reference is also made to the factors affecting the absorbed dose in a patient and to proton radiobiology together with the results of studies of comparisons of treatment planning with protons with that using conventional photon therapy. The dosimetry of proton beams is also reviewed. [References: 85]

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, a Phase II clinical trial of C-ion RT with a total dose of 66 GyE in 20 fractions was performed on 175 patients with prostate cancer, and the correlations of clinical and dosimetric parameters with the incidence of late GI toxicity in 172 patients who survived for more than 18 months were investigated. RESULTS: Although no Grade 3-4 late morbidities of the rectum were observed, Grade 1 and 2 morbidities developed in 23 (13%) and 4 (2%) patients, respectively. Dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the percentage of rectal volume receiving 50% of the prescribed dose (V50) was significantly higher in patients with rectal toxicity than without toxicity (13.2 +/- 5.6% with toxicity; 11.4 +/- 4.0% without toxicity, p = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.010) and rectal V50 (p = 0.012) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of Grade 1-2 late GI toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although C-ion RT with hypofractionation yielded favorable results regarding late GI complication, dosimetric parameter was a very important factor in the occurrence of rectal bleeding after C-ion RT as well as photon beam RT. Our results provide useful information for physicians applying charged particle RT in the treatment of prostate cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39%) and 4 (1%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer	
0	2763	Stereotactic single high dose radiation therapy of benign intracranial meningiomas	Adult, Aged, Brain, Female, Humans, Male, Meningeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Meningioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Recurrence, Research, Stereotaxic Techniques, Time, Tungsten, Universities	Seventeen patients with intracranial meningiomas were treated with single high dose irradiation at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Indications for radiosurgery included unresected tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and recurrences. Therapy was carried out by a technique using multiple non-coplanar arc irradiations from a 15 MeV linear accelerator. This technique coupled with secondary tungsten collimators allowed a high concentration of the dose in the target volume with an extremely steep dose gradient at the field borders. The patients were treated with a single irradiation dose ranging from 10 to 50 Gy (mean of 29 Gy). Four of 17 patients died: one death was tumor-related and not attributable to the treatment, one died of a treatment related complication, and two patients died of intercurrent diseases. The remaining 13 of the 17 patients with a median follow-up time of 40 months have no evidence of tumor relapse. Late severe side effects include five patients with a large area of brain edema, three of which were concurred with tumor necrosis. We conclude from these initial data that single high doses of irradiation concentrated to the tumor volume by stereotaxic methods can achieve local tumor control. It is also clear from these data that the effective therapeutic dose range must be better defined

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. A total of 2645 patients (2648 eyes) with uveal melanoma were treated between 1984 and 1999 with proton beam radiotherapy. Data were analyzed as of February 2001. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 90 years, 1284 were men, and 1361 were women. Largest tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 27.5 mm, and tumor height from 0.9 to 15.6 mm. Median follow-up time was 44 months. RESULTS: The overall eye retention rate at 5, 10, and 15 years after treatment was 88.9%, 86.2%, and 83.7%, respectively. In total, 218 eyes had to be enucleated. Enucleation was related to larger tumor size, mainly tumor height, proximity of posterior tumor margin to optic disc, male gender, high intraocular pressure, and large degree of retinal detachment at treatment time. After optimization of the treatment technique, the eye retention rate at 5 years was increased from 97.1% to 100% for small tumors, from 86.7% to 99.7% for medium, and from 71.1% to 89.5% for large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment technique as used today results in excellent eye retention rates, even in less favorable cases such as large tumors and tumors located close to the optic disc. The experience and a continuous quality control program allowed us to improve the 5-year eye retention rate for all tumor sizes. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of experience and quality control-based efforts for treatment technique optimization

We evaluated whether L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake and its change after CIRT were the early survival predictors in patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MET positron emission tomography was prospectively performed in 62 patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas before and within 1 month after CIRT. Tumor MET uptake was measured with the semiquantitative tumor:nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). The MET uptake in the tumor and relevant clinical parameters were entered into univariate and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 20 months. Patients with a baseline T/N ratio of <or=6 had a significant better survival than patients with a baseline T/N ratio >6 (2-year survival rate: 69.4% versus 32.3%; P = 0.01). Patients with a post-CIRT ratio of <or=4.4 had a better survival than that with a post-CIRT ratio >4.4 (2-year survival rate: 63.7% versus 41.3%; P = 0.01). A significant higher survival rate was observed in patients with post-therapeutic MET uptake change of >30% than patients in lower change group (2-year survival rate: 74.6% versus 41.6%; P = 0.049). The multivariate analysis showed that both baseline and post-CIRT T/N ratio were statistically significant independent predictors of patient survival. Tumors with larger T/N ratio had a significantly poorer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: MET uptake as measured by either baseline or post-CIRT T/N ratio was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherapy, whereas post-therapeutic MET uptake change might have potential value for the same purpose	
0	2477	Neutron therapy of low grade "pencil" gliomas of the spinal cord: a review of ten cases	Adult, Astrocytoma/di [Diagnosis], Astrocytoma/mo [Mortality], Astrocytoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Combined Modality Therapy, Ependymoma/di [Diagnosis], Ependymoma/mo [Mortality], Ependymoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Fast Neutrons, Female, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/mo [Mortality], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Neutrons, Particle Accelerators, Postoperative Care, Radiotherapy Dosage, Remission Induction, Skin, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Spinal Cord Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Universities	Between 1980 and 1986 ten patients (two males, eight females, median age: 35 years) with spongioblastomas and ependymomas grade I of the spinal cord were treated with fast neutrons from the d(14) + Be reaction after incomplete tumour surgery. Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality	
1	2875	Evaluation of tumor regression and other prognostic factors for early and late metastasis after proton irradiation of uveal melanoma	Boston, Ciliary Body, Eye, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/pa [Pathology], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Remission Induction, Risk, Risk Factors, Time, Time Factors, Ultrasonography, Uveal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	The authors examined the relationship of change in tumor height after proton beam irradiation with the risk of metastasis in 700 patients treated for uveal melanoma before July 1, 1986. Rates of change in tumor height were computed for each patient using follow-up ultrasonographic measures during the first 2 years after treatment. Risk of metastasis was evaluated separately in the first 2 years after treatment when tumor decline was assessed (concurrent metastasis), and 2 years or later after treatment (subsequent metastasis). Using Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for other known risk factors, tumors regressing rapidly were significantly more likely to metastasize concurrently with their regression (P less than 0.05). The opposite was found for subsequent metastasis: tumors with a slow annual decline were more likely to metastasize after 2 years after treatment (P less than 0.05). Substantial changes also were noted in the ability of previously described prognostic factors (largest tumor diameter, tumor height, ciliary body involvement, and patient's age) to predict early and late metastasis. Characteristics placing individuals at high risk of metastasis may change markedly with time after treatment

We evaluated the radiographic appearance of the vertebral bodies in children treated with proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to illustrate the distal edge effect of proton radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 13 adolescents aged 12-18 years who received CSI with proton radiotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ten of these patients had reached maximal or near-maximal growth. Proton beam radiation for these 10 patients was delivered to the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots only, whereas the remaining 3 patients had a target volume that included the thecal sac, exiting nerve roots, and entire vertebral bodies. Median CSI dose was 27 [range, 23.4-36] cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) given in 1.8-CGE fractions. Magnetic resonance images of the spine were obtained after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images of patients who received proton radiotherapy to the thecal sac only demonstrate a sharp demarcation of hyperintense T1-weighted signal in the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, consistent with radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement. Magnetic resonance images of the patients prescribed proton radiotherapy to the entire vertebral column had corresponding hyperintense T1-weighted signal involving the entire vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: The sharp delineation of radiation-associated fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral bodies demonstrates the rapid decrease in energy at the edge of the proton beam. This provides evidence for a sharp fall-off in radiation dose and supports the premise that proton radiotherapy spares normal tissues unnecessary irradiation

Although the importance of the area of irradiated lung is well known, the irradiated area of mediastinum is little to be considered in the routine treatment. PURPOSE: To evaluate the significance of the irradiated area of the mediastinum in the simulation film for radiation induced lung injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients with primary lung cancer treated with radiation therapy were analyzed for incidence of radiation induced lung injury. Lung injury was defined as the appearance of an abnormal shadow on the chest radiograph. CT images were used to differentiate recurrence or other conditions. Age, sex, irradiation dose, irradiated lung area, T and N factors of the tumor, irradiated mediastinum area, performance status of patients, location of irradiated fields and use of chemotherapy were analyzed with Cox's multivariate regression model. RESULTS: The cumulative rate of radiation induced lung injury at 12 months was 85%. Significant factor of radiation induced lung injury was irradiated area of the mediastinum (p = 0.03). Irradiated area of the lung (p = 0.18, n.s.), total tumor dose (p = 0.1, n.s.), use of chemotherapy (p = 0.08, n.s.) and location of irradiated field (p = 0.08, n.s.) may also have an effect on radiation induced lung injury. CONCLUSION: The irradiated area of the mediastinum is one of the significant factors in radiation induced lung injury

0	4137	Stereotactic linear radiosurgery for cavernous angiomas	Adult, Brain Neoplasms/co [Complications], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Brain Stem/su [Surgery], Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hemangioma,Cavernous/co [Complications], Hemangioma,Cavernous/su [Surgery], Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Radiation Dosage, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/mt [Methods], Risk Factors, Science, Temporal Lobe, Thalamus/su [Surgery], Women	Optimal management of symptomatic cavernous angiomas (CA) located in the thalamus and the brainstem is problematic. Clinical and radiological (MRI) follow-up series suggest that having hemorrhaged once, recurrent hemorrhage with progressive neurologic dysfunction may commonly occur. We have therefore chosen to treat these lesions when first symptomatic with stereotactic linear radiosurgery (SLR). We now report, after a median follow-up of 27 months, 12 patients with CAs (9 women, 3 men, mean age 40 years) treated in this fashion. Ten patients presented with hemorrhage (3 had more than one hemorrhage): two patients had new onset seizures. All patients had enhanced MRI/MRAs characteristic of CA. There were five brainstem and five thalamic CAs, and one each in the temporal lobe and insula. Cerebral angiograms were done in 8 patients for comparison with their respective MRAs. Only one CA was visualized in the late venous phase on cerebral angiogram and identical vascular features were appreciated on the MRA. The diameter of the CAs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 cm with a mean of 1.6 cm. Dosimetry planning was based on MRI/CT features and the mean dose at the isocenter was 2.167 cGy (range = 2,000-2,500 cGy) delivered with a mean collimation diameter of 1.46 cm (range = 1.0-2.0 cm). All 12 patients continued to improve neurologically after SLR and had MRI-documented changes in their lesions: in general, the lesions became smaller and signal characteristics converted to methemaglobin. However, 1 patient had an early post-SLR hemorrhage, documented by MRI, at 4.5 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized interventional case series. METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent TTT for small uveal melanomas located in the posterior pole of the eyes. Tumors were between 2.5 and 4 mm in thickness. TTT was performed with a diode laser at 810 nm. Patients had between one and three TTT sessions, with an intensity adapted to the coloration of the fundus impact. Biomicroscopic examination, ultrasonographic measurements, and angiography were performed before and two months, four months, and six months after treatment, then regularly during follow-up. RESULTS: Eight of the 18 tumors regressed and 10 recurred. The one- and two-year metastasis-free survival rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method were, respectively, 61.11% to 44.44% (95% confidence interval). Recurrences were managed with enucleation (three patients), proton beam therapy (six), or additional thermotherapy (one). After treatment, visual acuity was maintained or improved for the eight patients with nonrecurrent tumors. Pathologic analysis of the three enucleated eyes revealed scleral invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite encouraging initial short-term results obtained with TTT for the management of small choroidal melanomas, the occurrence of severe complications, especially recurrences and insufficient local tumor control, should raise concern about indications for primary TTT given as isolated treatment for small melanomas of the posterior pole

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2000, 33 patients with head and neck malignancies but no history of surgical resection were treated with 250-MeV protons with or without X-ray irradiation. This study retrospectively evaluated local control, survival, and treatment sequelae of these patients. The median total target dose using protons with or without X-rays was 76 Gy (range: 42-99 Gy) and the median proton dose per fraction 2.8 Gy (range: 1.5-6.0 Gy). RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival and local control rates were 44% and 74%, respectively. One (3%) and six patients (18%) suffered from treatment-related acute and late toxicity > grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria). One patient with a history of radiotherapy suffered from acute toxicity > grade 3. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy appeared to offer high local control rates with few toxicities relative to conventional radiotherapy. However, late toxicity was seen in areas where large radiation doses had been given	
0	1317	Optimization of radiation therapy for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas with infiltration of the skull base using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a carbon ion boost	Carbon, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Ethmoid Sinus, Germany, Humans, Ions, Jaw Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lead, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit	
0	1933	[Quantitative analysis of pulmonary functional damage due to heavy ion particle irradiation therapy for lung cancer]. [Japanese]	Aged, Blood Gas Analysis, Female, Fibrosis, Heavy Ions, Humans, Japan, Lung, Lung Neoplasms/pp [Physiopathology], Lung Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lung/re [Radiation Effects], Male, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Radiation Injuries/pp [Physiopathology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Universities	Seventeen patients with clinical stage I lung cancer were given irradiation therapy with heavy ion radioactive rays at 73.1 +/- 11.2 GyE. Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications	
1	3985	Precision, high dose radiotherapy: helium ion treatment of uveal melanoma	Adult, Aged, Eye/bs [Blood Supply], Female, Glaucoma/et [Etiology], Helium, Humans, Immobilization, Incidence, Ions, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local, Neovascularization,Pathologic, Particle Accelerators, Protons, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Visual Acuity	We report on 75 patients with uveal melanoma who were treated by placing the Bragg peak of a helium ion beam over the tumor volume. The technique localizes the high dose region very tightly around the tumor volume. This allows critical structures, such as the optic disc and the macula, to be excluded from the high dose region as long as they are 3 to 4 mm away from the edge of the tumor. Careful attention to tumor localization, treatment planning, patient immobilization and treatment verification is required. With a mean follow-up of 22 months (3 to 60 months) we have had only five patients with a local recurrence, all of whom were salvaged with another treatment. Pretreatment visual acuity has generally been preserved as long as the tumor edge is at least 4 mm away from the macula and optic disc. The only serious complication to date has been an 18% incidence of neovascular glaucoma in the patients treated at our highest dose level. Clinical results and details of the technique are presented to illustrate potential clinical precision in administering high dose radiotherapy with charged particles such as helium ions or protons

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopic imaging studies were performed in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before, during, and after radiation therapy and at follow-up at 33 months after diagnosis of the recurrence of disease. The patient had a single, large lesion in the brain and underwent hyperfractionated radiation therapy for 4 weeks. A series of MR images was also obtained. RESULTS: The pretreatment study showed a lesion with a distinct spectral pattern: marked elevation of choline and lipids and great reduction of creatine and N-acetylaspartate. During and after treatment, H-1 MR spectroscopic images depicted a progressive reduction of the abnormal choline and lipid signals. Thirty-three months after treatment, multiple-section H-1 MR spectroscopic images showed normal spectral patterns in all sections examined. CONCLUSION: H-1 MR spectroscopy may contribute to the neuroradiologic evaluation of NHL and, in particular, may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response

The patient and her relatives insisted on carrying the pregnancy to maturity, despite undergoing irradiation of her right knee for local control of her disease and to take the teratological risk, if any, that it entails. This paper discusses the measurement of scattered dose in water, fetal dose estimation in an Alderson-Rando human phantom and possible ways of minimizing it	
1	2752	An evaluation of the influence of reproductive factors on the risk of metastases from uveal melanoma	Adolescent, Adult, Boston, Choroid Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Choroid Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Choroid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Contraceptives,Oral, Environment, Eye, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Melanoma/sc [Secondary], Methods, Middle Aged, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/mo [Mortality], Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/pa [Pathology], Pregnancy Complications,Neoplastic/rt [Radiotherapy], Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Reproductive History, Risk, Risk Factors, Sex Factors, Survival Analysis, Women	BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data concerning the possible role played by hormonal factors in the risk of metastases from intraocular melanomas. METHODS: The authors studied the influence of post-diagnosis pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a group of women of reproductive age (45 or younger) who were treated for uveal melanoma by proton beam irradiation. A baseline reproductive history had been collected before irradiation for all women, and interim reproductive data were collected by mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: In this age group, the overall rate of metastasis among women was similar to that of men treated during the same interval (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-2.67). A total of 24 full-term pregnancies were reported among the 139 women still menstruating at diagnosis. Twenty-three women reported regular oral contraceptive use. Metastases developed in 15 of the 139 women. Compared with other women in the series, rates of metastases were not higher among the women who reported pregnancies (P = 0.932) or oral contraceptive use (P = 0.424) after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited numbers, results suggest that the hormonal environment has no appreciable influence on risk of metastases in younger women with uveal melanoma

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma initially treated with 50.0-88.2 Gy photons were re-treated with protons to additional doses of 59.4-70.2 CGE. Local-regional control and survival were correlated with extent of relapse, recurrence versus persistence, and prescribed dose and were subjected to dose-volume histogram analysis. Mean follow-up was 23.7 months (range, 4-47 months). RESULTS: Twenty-four-month actuarial overall and local-regional progression-free survival rates were both 50%. The 24-month actuarial overall survival rates for patients with "optimal" dose-volume histogram coverage versus "suboptimal" coverage were 83% and 17%, respectively (P = .006). Doses to critical structures were low (0-22.0 Gy); no central nervous system side effects supervened. CONCLUSION: Adequate tumor coverage, as evaluated by using dose-volume histogram analysis, was found to be the most important variable influencing local-regional control and survival. No central nervous system complications were observed; increases in the dose to adjacent critical structures are being evaluated	
0	2517	Neon heavy charged particle radiotherapy of glioblastoma of the brain	Adult, Aged, Arm, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], California, Californium, Cause of Death, Energy Transfer, Female, Glioblastoma, Glioblastoma/mo [Mortality], Glioblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Linear Energy Transfer, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Methods, Middle Aged, Neon, Neon/tu [Therapeutic Use], Neutron Capture Therapy, Neutrons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Research, Survival, Time, Universities	PURPOSE: High-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation beams have potential applications in the treatment of glioblastoma, but have not yet demonstrated significant improvement in results. However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the period from 1977 to 1992, 223 patients were irradiated with charged particles at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for tumors either arising in or extending to the skull base, of whom 48 (22%) had recurrent lesions, either post previous surgery or radiotherapy. One hundred twenty-six patients had lesions arising in the cranial base, mostly chordoma (53), chondrosarcoma (27), paraclival meningioma (27) with 19 patients having other histologies such as osteosarcoma or neurofibrosarcoma. There were also 31 patients with primary or recurrent squamous carcinoma of the nasopharynx extending to the skull base, 44 patients with major or minor salivary gland tumors, mostly adenocarcinoma, and 22 patients with squamous carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses, all with cranial base extension. RESULTS: Local control and survival appeared improved in tumors arising in the skull base, following the ability with charged particles to deliver high doses (mean of 65 Gy-equivalent) with relative sparing of the adjacent normal tissues. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year local control was 85% for meningioma, 78% for chondrosarcoma, 63% for chordoma and 58% for other sarcoma. Follow-up ranged from 4-191 months with a median of 51 months. CONCLUSION: Charged particle radiotherapy is highly effective in controlling cranial base lesions which have have been partially resected. Better tumor localization with CT and MRI, improved 3-D treatment planning and beam delivery techniques have continued to reduce the level of serious complications and increase local control and survival.

0	2994	Preliminary clinical experience with linear accelerator-based spinal stereotactic radiosurgery	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Animals, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Immobilization, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neurosurgery/td [Trends], Particle Accelerators, Radiation, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Research, Spinal Cord, Spinal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Spinal Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Spinal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Spine/pa [Pathology], Spine/ra [Radiography], Spine/su [Surgery], Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Universities	A prototype device called an extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery frame was used to deliver stereotactic radiosurgery, with a modified linear accelerator, to metastatic neoplasms in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions in five patients. In all patients, the neoplasms had failed to respond to spinal cord tolerance doses delivered by standard external fractionated radiation therapy to a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 33-65 Gy/11-30 fractions). The tumors were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with the spinal stereotactic frame for immobilization, localization, and treatment. The median number of isocenters was one (range, one to five) with a median single fraction dose of 10 Gy (range, 8-10 Gy) with median normalization to 80% isodose contour (range, 80-160%). There has been a single complication of esophagitis to date from radiosurgery of a tumor involving the C6-T1 segments; the esophagitis resolved with medical therapy. Median follow-up in this group of patients has been 6 months (range, 1-12 mo). To date, there has been no radiographic or clinical progression of the treated tumor in any patient. Two patients have died from systemic metastatic disease. In the three surviving patients, there has been computed tomographic- or magnetic resonance-documented regression of the treated tumor with a decrease of thecal sac compression with a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-14 mo). These five patients represent the first clinical application of stereotactic radiosurgery in the spine. The results suggest that extracranial radiosurgery may be suitable for the treatment of paraspinal neoplasms after external fractionated radiation therapy, even in the face of spinal cord compression

The indications for double-dose irradiation with the same radio-element corresponded to "macroscopically abnormal" situations: immediate and prolonged radioresistance, recurrence or secondary radioresistance. Thirteen cases are called series 1 (Ruthenium) and 6 cases are called series 2 (protons). The series 1 allows a more reliable study as far as follow-up is higher (5.8 to 7.5 years) than in series 2 where the follow-up is shorter (13.6 to 29 months). Although double-dose irradiation was macroscopically efficient in 11 out of 13 cases in series 1, and in 3 out of 6 cases in series 2 (stabilization or decrease of tumour height measured before the second therapeutic session), 2 patients are deceased and 1 has a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of Ruthenium serie. Another one has also a metastatic disease in the group "recurrence" of protons series. Nevertheless double-dose radiotherapy allows a complementary decrease or stabilization of tumour height after a first session. It also decreases the indications for enucleation if there is no severe anatomic complications, when a tumour does not regress or recurs after a first session of radiations

Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs	
0	722	Comparative treatment planning on localized prostate carcinoma conformal photon- versus proton-based radiotherapy	Femur/re [Radiation Effects], Head, Humans, Male, Neoplasm Staging, Photons, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiobiology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Rectum/re [Radiation Effects], Research, Risk, Urinary Bladder/re [Radiation Effects]	PURPOSE: To assess the potential benefit of proton-beam therapy in comparison to 3-D conformal photon therapy and photon- based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma for various stages of disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five patients a 3-D conformal proton-based (two lateral beams) irradiation technique was compared with 3-D conformal photon-beam radiotherapy (four-field box) and IMRT (seven beams). For each patient different target volumes (CTVs) were defined according to early, intermediate and advanced stages of disease: CTV I consisted of the prostate gland, CTV II encompassed prostate and basis of seminal vesicles, and CTV III the prostate and seminal vesicles. Corresponding planning target volumes PTV I-III were defined by uniformly adding a margin of 5 mm to CTV I-III. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the different PTVs and various organs at risk (OARs), i.e., rectal wall, bladder, both femoral heads. In addition, maximum and mean doses were derived for the various structures and irradiated non-target tissue volumes were compared for PTV I-III and the different irradiation techniques. Finally, dose conformity and target dose homogeneity were assessed. RESULTS: With photon- and proton-based radiotherapy techniques similar dose distributions were determined for PTV I-III: mean and maximum PTV dose values were between 99-104% and 102-107% of the normalized total doses (70 Gy), respectively. Conformity indices varied from 1.4 to 1.5 for the photon techniques, whereas for proton-beam radiotherapy values ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. Both the 3-D conformal and the IMRT photon treatment technique resulted in increased mean doses (approximately 40-80%) for OARs when compared to protons. With both photon techniques non-target tissue volumes were irradiated to higher doses (mean dose difference > or = 70%) compared to proton-beam radiotherapy. Differences occurred mainly at the low and medium dose levels, whereas in high dose levels similar values were obtained. In comparison to conformal 3-D treatments IMRT reduced doses to OARs in the medium dose range, especially for the rectal wall. CONCLUSION: IMRT enabled dose reductions to OARs in the medium dose range compared to 3-D conformal radiotherapy. A rather simple two-field proton-based treatment technique further reduced doses to OARs compared to photon-beam radiotherapy. The advantageous dose distribution of proton-beam therapy for prostate cancer may result in reduced side effects, which needs to be confirmed in clinical studies

DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone

Local tumor control and long-term palliation for both primary and metastatic tumors may be achieved with IMRT while reducing the risk of spinal cord toxicity associated with conventional radiotherapy techniques. In this article, we report our initial clinical experience in treating 16 paraspinal tumors with IMRT in which the planning target volume was 2 mm or greater from the spinal cord. METHODS: IMRT was administered by using a linear accelerator mounted with a multileaf collimator. Two immobilization body frames developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were used for patients with and without spinal implants. During a 30-month period, 16 patients underwent IMRT for metastatic and primary tumors. Eleven patients were treated for symptomatic recurrences after undergoing surgery and prior external beam radiotherapy, and one patient was treated after undergoing radiotherapy for a metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma with overlapping ports to the spine. Four patients with primary tumors were treated after primary resection that resulted in positive histological margins. Twelve patients were symptomatic with pain, functional radiculopathy, or both. Tumoral doses were determined on the basis of the relative radiosensitivity of tumors. Patients with metastatic tumors were administered a median tumoral dose of 20 Gy in four to five fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 6.0 Gy in addition to the full tolerance dose administered in previous radiation treatments. The primary tumors were delivered a median dose of 70 Gy in 33 to 37 fractions and a spinal cord maximum dose of 16 Gy. The median tumoral volume was 7.8 cm(3). RESULTS: Of the 15 patients who underwent radiographic follow-up, 13 demonstrated either no interval growth or a reduction in tumor size in a median follow-up period of 12 months (range, 2-23 mo). Two patients, one with a thoracic chondrosarcoma and one with a chordoma, showed tumor progression 1 year after undergoing IMRT. Pain symptoms improved in 11 of 11 patients, and 4 of 4 patients had significant improvement in their functionally significant radiculopathy and/or plexopathy. Pain relief was durable in all patients except the two with tumor progression. No patient showed signs or symptoms of radiation-induced myelopathy, radiculopathy, or plexopathy, including 12 patients with a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSION: IMRT was effective for treating pain and improving functional radiculopathy in patients with metastatic and primary tumors. Although long-term tumor control is not established in this study, high-dose tumoral irradiation can be performed without causing radiation myelopathy in more than 1 year of follow-up	
1	3745	A new combined approach in the conservative management of rectal cancer	Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Adenocarcinoma/su [Surgery], Adenocarcinoma/th [Therapy], Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Brachytherapy/is [Instrumentation], Brachytherapy/mt [Methods], Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, France, Humans, Iridium Radioisotopes, Iridium Radioisotopes/tu [Therapeutic Use], Male, Middle Aged, Particle Accelerators, Prognosis, Radioisotopes, Radiotherapy,High-Energy, Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Rectal Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Rectum, Recurrence	Between 1980 and 1987, 25 patients with rectal cancer were treated with a combination of preoperative external irradiation of 35 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks which was followed, 6 to 8 weeks later, by a tumorectomy and peroperative placement of a plastic tube loop for post-operative interstitial therapy by iridium-192. This boost dose was 20 Gy (Paris System) for submucosal lesions (seven patients) and 25 Gy for intramural (eight patients) and extramural (ten patients) lesions. With a mean follow-up of 40.5 months, there have been five local recurrences, the latest occurring 16 months post-tumorectomy. Two of these five patients are alive and disease-free 1 year post salvage abdominoperineal resection. The 20 patients with local control have preserved a full functional sphincter and 19 of them are disease-free; there were few complications. This sphincter preserving combined approach seems promising for patients with tumors of the middle and lower rectum who cannot undergo major surgery and for selected patients who refuse abdominoperineal resection

Treatment planning techniques involving therapeutic beam characteristics are described here. The vertical (140 MeV/u) and horizontal (170 MeV/u) carbon ion beams from the synchrotron at the NIRS were shaped, using the passive beam delivery system, to irradiate the target volume. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with a region of uniform HMV-I cell killing. The apertures and range compensators were designed for individual patients. A commercial treatment planning system, which was customized to our general carbon ion therapy, was tested for applicability to this treatment. Dose distributions were calculated with either a broad beam or a pencil beam algorithm using parameters determined by measurements and calculations. We evaluated the accuracy of the system software features, and replaced or added some other features to the software. The system was used for 12 patients during the past year. For nine patients two-port treatment was assessed to be more effective than mono-port therapy and these patients were treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

A high alpha 1-antitrypsin level and a normal alpha 2-macroglobulin level were found in all the breast cancer patients. An increase in both blood serum inhibitors was detected in hypophyseal adenoma. The dependence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin content on a subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spread was revealed in the course of 2 years following "hypophysectomy" in the patients with disseminated breast cancer. In the hypophyseal adenoma patients the activity of both inhibitors returned to normal 1 year after treatment and remained within normal during 3 years of follow-up. It was regarded as a positive therapeutic effect. The above findings make it possible to propose the determination of the activity af alpha 1-antitrypsin in breast cancer and alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in hypophyseal adenoma as an additional test for the evaluation of the results of proton "hypophysectomy"

The optimal therapeutic management is unclear but, in general, this tumour is treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Proton beam radiation therapy (PT) offers superior dose distributional qualities compared with X- or gamma rays, as the dose deposition occurs in a modulated narrow zone called the Bragg peak. As a result, organs at risk are optimally speared. Here, we present a patient treated with the first spinal axis segment irradiation using spot-scanning PT with a single field, combined with conventional cranio-spinal axis radiotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy, and an extensive review of the literature outlining the clinical features and treatment modality of spinal PNET.

However, some patients have had local control of glioblastoma with high-LET irradiations such as neutrons and heavy charged particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this collaborative study, 15 patients were entered into a randomized protocol comparing two dose levels of 20 and 25 Gy in 4 weeks of neon ion irradiation. This trial was intended to determine the optimal neon dose in terms of survival and effects of radiation. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluable with no significant differences in median survival (13 and 14 months; p = NS) or median time to failure (7 and 9 months; p = NS) between the two dose arms. Three patients died of nontumor-related causes, of whom one (who died 19 months posttreatment) had autopsy confirmation of no tumor on pathological exam. The other two patients had stable magnetic resonance imaging scans at 6 and 22 months posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Although the results did not demonstrate the optimal high-LET dose level, there is an intriguing effect in that two patients had control of glioblastoma until death at 19 and 22 months. This suggests that better conformation of the high-LET dose to the tumor with neutron capture therapy or dynamic conformal heavy charged particle therapy might control glioblastoma while minimizing brain damage from radiation

METHODS AND MATERIAL: The 3D dose distributions were analyzed in 85 patients with cervical vertebral tumors. Mean follow-up was 41.3 months. The mean prescribed dose was 76.3 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE = proton dose x RBE 1.1). Dose constraints to the center and the surface of the cervical cord were 55-58 CGE and 67-70 CGE, respectively. Dose parameters, DVH and EUD, were calculated for each patient. The spinal cord toxicity was graded using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late effects scoring system. RESULTS: Thirteen patients experienced Grade 1-2 toxicity. Four patients had Grade 3 toxicity. For the dose range used in this study, none of the dosimetric parameters was found to be associated with the observed distribution of cord toxicities. The only factor significantly associated with cord toxicity was the number of surgeries before irradiation. CONCLUSION: The data and our analysis suggest that the integrity of the normal musculoskeletal supportive tissues and vascular supply may be important confounding factors of toxicity at these dose levels. The results also indicate that the cervical spinal cord dose constraints used in treating these patients are appropriate for conformal proton-photon radiotherapy

This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.

For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended

A second set of lateral lasers was mounted approximately 20 cm below the isocentre allowing patient positioning at an ergonomical height. A small randomised study involving 16 heavy patients treated for pelvic malignancies demonstrated that using the lower lasers for patient set-up is not only likely to reduce strain on staff but also speed up the set-up process

A case report	Aged, Humans, Lymphoma, Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/di [Diagnosis], Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/pa [Pathology], Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin/rt [Radiotherapy], Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pa [Pathology], Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Testicular Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Testicular Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Testicular Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Testis, Testis/pa [Pathology]	PURPOSE: To monitor the metabolic changes during the radiation treatment of a recurrence of a high malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the left testis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 76-year old patients who presented a diffuse centroblastic high malignant NHL recurrence in the left scrotal sac was examined with 31-P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before, during and after megavoltage radiotherapy to a total dose of 56 Gy. RESULTS: The 31-P MRS spectrum of the tumor showed before starting irradiation, intensive phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals that overlapped the inorganic phosphate (Pi) signal. After 26 Gy irradiation, the Pi peak appeared and revealed an intratumoral pH of 7.08 very close to that in the normal testis (pH of 7.02). After 56 Gy the tumor disappeared and a complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. 31-P MRS is sensitive to the changes in the tumor metabolic activity after irradiation with a dose of 26 Gy. 2. Pi and PME peaks could be good pathological markers in the steady-state response to irradiation. 3. MRI could confirm the radiation induced tumor regression and the achieved clinical complete remission	
0	1567	[Report on proton therapy according to good clinical practice at Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center]. [Japanese]	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Cancer Care Facilities, Carbon, Female, Head, Humans, Japan, Liver, Lung, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Prostate, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Safety, Treatment Outcome	The Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center(HIBMC) is a hospital-based charged particle treatment facility. Having two treatment ion beams(proton and carbon) and five treatment rooms, it is a pioneer among particle institutes worldwide. In May 2001, proton therapy was started as a clinical study for patients with localized cancer originating in the head and neck, lung, liver, and prostate. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and stability of the treatment units and systems based on the evaluation of acute toxicity, tumor response, and working ratio of the machine, respectively. Six patients, including liver cancer in three, prostate cancer in two, and lung cancer in one, were treated. There was no cessation of therapy owing to machine malfunction. Full courses of proton therapy consisting of 154 portals in all six patients were given exactly as scheduled. None of the patients experienced severe acute reactions of more than grade 3 according to NCI-CTC criteria. Tumor response one month post-treatment was evaluable in five of the six patients, and was CR in 1 (prostate cancer), PR in 2 (lung cancer: 1, liver cancer: 1), and NC in 2(liver cancer: 2). These results indicate that our treatment units and systems are safe and reliable enough for proton irradiation to be used for several malignant tumors localized in the body	
0	4693	Cauda equina tolerance to high-dose fractionated irradiation	Actuarial Analysis, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Cauda Equina/re [Radiation Effects], Child, Cobalt, Disease-Free Survival, Dose Fractionation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Medical Records, Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Tolerance/ph [Physiology], Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Research, Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Retrospective Studies, Spinal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Spinal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: To report late neurologic toxicity rates and clinical outcomes for patients treated with high dose fractionated radiation therapy using three-dimensional treatment planning and combined proton and photon beams to portions of the cauda equina (L2-coccyx). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 53 patients treated to fields encompassing the cauda equina were reviewed for the onset of neurologic symptoms in the absence of local failure. All doses were normalized to equivalent dose delivered in 2-Gy fractions. Median cauda dose was 65.8 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) (range, 31.9-85.1). Median follow-up was 87 months (range, 14-217 months). RESULTS: Nineteen patients experienced local recurrences, and 13 others had neurologic toxicity. A total of 54% (i.e., 7/13) of the toxicities occurred 5 years or more after treatment. Median caudal dose was 73.7 CGE in the group with neurologic toxicity, and 55.6 CGE in those without. On multivariate actuarial analysis, cauda dose and gender were statistically significant for neurotoxicity at p = 0.002 and p = 0.017, respectively. The estimated tolerance doses 5 years from treatment, TD 5/5 and TD 50/5, were 55 CGE and 72 CGE, respectively, for males and 67 CGE and 84 CGE for females. The tolerance doses were about 8 CGE lower when estimated at 10 years from treatment. Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 66% and 53%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the probability of neurotoxicity is a relatively steep function of dose to cauda equina (slope gamma50 = approximately 3). The cauda equina tolerance is greater for females than males by about 11 CGE (at 2 CGE per fraction). Extended follow-up is necessary to accurately assess neurologic damage and then differentiate that phenomenon from local recurrence; the traditional 5-year assessment has limited meaning in this population. Local control remains an issue for these patients, even with the radical doses used	
0	1010	Experience with conformal proton therapy for early prostate cancer	Aged, Humans, Japan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Treatment Outcome	A study was conducted to evaluate the use of proton beam therapy for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. This is a preliminary assessment of treatment-related morbidity and tumor response. Sixteen patients with T1-T2b prostate cancer underwent proton beam therapy. Acute and late toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grading System (version 2.0, April 1999) and to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system, respectively. Local control was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Although skin toxicity and bladder irritability were commonly observed, none of the patients developed grade III or IV toxicity. Of 9 patients in whom the primary lesion was detected by MRI, partial response and no change (NC) was observed in 6 (66.7%) and 3 (33.3%) patients, respectively. Four patients presented normal PSA value before treatment due to the previous endocrine therapy. However, the other 12 patients with elevated PSA value before treatment showed complete response. No patients showed PSA failure within the median follow-up period of 11.9 months. Although longer follow-up is necessary, minimum toxicity and good short-term clinical responses were observed following proton beam therapy in T1-T2 prostate cancer patients

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable	
1	2152	Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Boston, Brain Stem, Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Disease-Free Survival, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Recurrence, Research, Sex Factors, Skull Base, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Survival, Time	PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume

Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects

Thirty-four tumors were included in the experimental groups, of which twenty-three were irradiated and eleven served as controls. Tumors were irradiated with protons produced at the 160 megavolts Harvard cyclotron. The dose delivered to the tumor ranged from 7.5 to 27.5 proton gray in a single treatment, and 25.0 proton gray delivered in two fractions separated by 24 hours. Reduction of tumor growth was significantly greater than controls (p less than 0.001) with treatment doses greater than or equal to 17.5 proton gray. Histologic examination revealed a marked decrease of mitotic activity in all specimens examined 48 hours after treatment at these higher doses. Total regression without evidence of remaining malignant cells was noted in three tumors treated at 17.5 proton gray or above. Our results indicate that human retinoblastoma in a murine host, with a tumor mass similar to that seen in a clinical setting, is sensitive to radiation by high energy protons

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients	
0	1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range: 14-85 years), were treated at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO), France, using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range: 60-70 CGE). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 4-71 months), the 3-year local control rates were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates 88% and 75%, respectively. 14 tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical target volume [CTV], and two without further assessment). Seven patients died from their tumor and another one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and, similarly, the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age < or = 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter < 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV < 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on local control. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. CONCLUSION: In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure. In two thirds of the cases, relapses are located in the GTV. Maximum diameter, GTV, and age are prognostic indicators of local control. These results should be confirmed during a longer follow-up

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 16 primary and 11 recurrent sacral chordoma patients treated from November 1982 to November 2002 by proton/photon radiation therapy alone (6 patients) or combined with surgery (21 patients) have been analyzed for local control, survival, and treatment-related morbidity. The outcome analysis is based on follow-up information as of 2005. RESULTS: Outcome results show a large difference in local failure rate between patients treated for primary and recurrent chordomas. Local control results by surgery and radiation were 12/14 vs. 1/7 for primary and recurrent lesions. For margin-positive patients, local control results were 10 of 11 and 0 of 5 in the primary and recurrent groups, respectively; the mean follow-up on these locally controlled patients was 8.8 years (4 at 10.3, 12.8, 17, and 21 years). Radiation alone was used in 6 patients, 4 of whom received > or =73.0 Gy (E); local control was observed in 3 of these 4 patients for 2.9, 4.9, and 7.6 years. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a high local control rate for surgical and radiation treatment of primary (12 of 14) as distinct from recurrent (1 of 7) sacral chordomas. Three of 4 chordomas treated by > or =73.0 Gy (E) of radiation alone had local control; 1 is at 91 months. This indicates that high-dose proton/photon therapy offers an effective treatment option

DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: All 1632 patients with choroidal melanoma treated at a single center between 1993 and 2002. INTERVENTION: Primary enucleation (35%), brachytherapy (31.3%), proton beam radiotherapy (16.7%), transscleral local resection (11.0%), endoresection (3.7%), transpupillary thermotherapy (2.5%), and photocoagulation (0.1%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary and secondary enucleation. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed the main predictive factors for primary enucleation to be: age more than 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-3.2%); reduced visual acuity (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.2%); posterior extension close to or involving the optic disc and fovea (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2%-2.4%); circumferential spread around the ciliary body, iris, or angle (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8%-5.5%); basal tumor diameter (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.4%-5.0%); and tumor height (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 4.5%-8.9%). After conservative treatment, the actuarial rate of secondary enucleation was 11.1% at 5 years (95% CI, 8.6%-13.6%). Cox multivariate analysis indicated the factors independently predicting secondary enucleation as: nasal/midline tumor location (risk ratio [RR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6%-4.4%); disc involvement (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2%-4.1%); tumor diameter (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.5%); and tumor thickness (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: With a multimodality approach to treatment, 65% of patients underwent conservative treatment, and of them, 89% retained their eye at 5 years, with success depending on tumor diameter, tumor thickness, disc involvement, and coronal location

A 20-year-old patient with NF2 presenting deafness due to bilateral acoustic neurinomas and unilateral amaurosis due to a meningioma of the optic nerve developed a pigmented parapapillary choroidal tumor. Despite signs indicating the diagnosis of a melanoma, periodic observation was chosen in order to postpone functional amputation following optic nerve irradiation. The tumor growth was slow during the 5 years that followed, and once progression became rapid, the tumor was treated by accelerated proton beam radiotherapy. One year later, visual acuity diminished due to actinic optic neuropathy and was stabilized at 0.3 for the 2 following years. The tumor presented objective signs of regression, and no sign of metastatic disease was observed. The therapeutic approach in this case provided local control of the tumor while preserving useful visual function

Although this therapeutic modality has been in use for a decade and although nearly 500 patients have been so treated, there are only two published reports of the pathologic examination of these eyes. Key features found on pathologic examination of our patient's enucleated eye included vascular alterations in the tumor's blood supply, lymphocytic infiltrates, and lipoidal degeneration of tumor cells. The interval from therapy to enucleation in our patient was much longer than in the several previously reported cases, a factor allowing for the development of a more cumulative radiation effect on the tumor. The extent and degree of radiation-induced necrosis in our patient's tumor were more profound than in previous reports	
1	683	Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a randomized controlled trial.[see comment]	Adenocarcinoma/bl [Blood], Adenocarcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Aged, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/bl [Blood], Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Recurrence, Research, Risk, Survival Rate	CONTEXT: Clinically localized prostate cancer is very prevalent among US men, but recurrence after treatment with conventional radiation therapy is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 61.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.6%-68.3%) for conventional-dose and 80.4% (95% confidence interval, 74.7%-86.1%) for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 49% reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was observed in both the low-risk and the higher-risk subgroups (risk reduction, 51% [P<.001] and 44% [P = .03], respectively). There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity

METHODS AND MATERIALS : Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p < 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications. CONCLUSION: In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1998 and April 2002, 16 patients with histopathologically proven ACC and residual macroscopic tumor were treated with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost to the macroscopic tumor. Median total tumor dose within the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 72 GyE. Photon radiation therapy (RT) consisted of fractionated stereotactic RT in 7 patients; 9 patients received stereotactic intensity-modulated RT. Carbon ion boost was delivered by intensity-controlled raster scanning at the heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) at the Heavy Ion Research Center (GSI) in Darmstadt. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 months. Three patients developed locoregional recurrences 9, 11, and 24 months after RT, respectively. Actuarial local control rates were 80.8% and 64.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival rates were 100% and 83.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Acute side effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 2 were observed in 2 patients; no patient developed late effects > CTC Grade 2. CONCLUSIONS: Combined photon and carbon ion RT is feasible and effective in patients with locally advanced ACC. Acute and late toxicity is moderate with respect to the delivered tumor doses and in accordance with the radiobiologic modeling. A Phase III trial is designed	
0	3973	Recurrent hyperthyroidism in an acromegalic patient previously treated with proton beam irradiation: Graves' disease as probable etiology based on follow-up observations	Acromegaly/bl [Blood], Acromegaly/co [Complications], Acromegaly/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Follow-Up Studies, Graves Disease/bl [Blood], Graves Disease/co [Complications], Graves Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Hyperthyroidism/bl [Blood], Hyperthyroidism/et [Etiology], Hyperthyroidism/rt [Radiotherapy], Middle Aged, Pituitary Irradiation, Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone/pd [Pharmacology], Thyrotropin/bl [Blood], Thyroxine/bl [Blood], Time, Triiodothyronine/bl [Blood]	A 56-year-old woman presented in 1973 with hyperthyroidism and partial anterior pituitary insufficiency. Three years before she had undergone pituitary irradiation for acromegaly and hyperthyroidism, the latter was attributed at the time to excessive TSH secretion because of elevations in plasma TSH. During the present 11/2 years of observation, TSH levels were appropriately low and did not respond to iv TRH when the patient was hyperthyroid. Moreover, they did not rise during treatment, even as the patient became borderline hypothyroid. It is concluded that hyperthyroidism probably has always been due to Graves' disease

We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position. CT scans were acquired three times weekly during the entire course of RT, and both gross tumor volumes (GTVs: primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) and normal tissues (parotid glands, spinal canal, mandible, and external contour) were manually contoured on every axial slice. Volumetric and positional changes relative to a central bony reference (the center of mass of the C2 vertebral body) were determined for each structure. RESULTS: Gross tumor volumes decreased throughout the course of fractionated RT, at a median rate of 0.2 cm(3) per treatment day (range, 0.01-1.95 cm(3)/d). In terms of the percentage of the initial volume, the GTVs decreased at a median rate of 1.8%/treatment day (range, 0.2-3.1%/d). On the last day of treatment, this corresponded to a median total relative loss of 69.5% of the initial GTV (range, 9.9-91.9%). In addition, the center of the mass of shrinking tumors changed position with time, indicating that GTV loss was frequently asymmetric. At treatment completion, the median center of the mass displacement (after corrections for daily setup variation) was 3.3 mm (range, 0-17.3 mm). Parotid glands also decreased in volume (median, 0.19 cm(3)/d range, 0.04-0.84 cm(3)/d), and generally shifted medially (median, 3.1 mm; range, 0-9.9 mm) with time. This medial displacement of the parotid glands correlated highly with the weight loss that occurred during treatment. CONCLUSION: Measurable anatomic changes occurred throughout fractionated external beam RT for head-and-neck cancers. These changes in the external contour, shape, and location of the target and critical structures appeared to be significant during the second half of treatment (after 3-4 weeks of treatment) and could have potential dosimetric impact when highly conformal treatment techniques are used. These data may, therefore, be useful in the development of an adaptive RT scheme (periodic adjustment of the conformal treatment plan) that takes into account such treatment-related anatomic changes. In theory, such a strategy would maximize the therapeutic ratio of RT

The frequency of moist epidermitis in a radical course of neutron therapy was 33%, that in combined neutron and photon irradiation was 21%. Mucosal reactions were observed in 30-35% of the patients with tumors of the oral mucosa. The most frequent radiation damage in a long-term period were fibrotic changes of the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue	
0	1317	Optimization of radiation therapy for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas with infiltration of the skull base using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a carbon ion boost	Carbon, Carcinoma,Adenoid Cystic/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose Fractionation, Ethmoid Sinus, Germany, Humans, Ions, Jaw Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Lead, Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Parotid Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Skull Base Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95% coverage 93.7% vs 87%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3% (median % reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit

At McGill University, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is given with a linear accelerator-based dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery unit. The first treatment is given using the stereotactic frame for target localization and head immobilization. Subsequent treatments are given using skin tattoos and laser alignment for target placement within the isocenter of the linear accelerator, and a modified portable halo-ring device is used for skull immobilization. Typically, a marginal dose of 42 Gy was prescribed at the margins of the lesion, divided in 6 fractions and given over a 2-week period. We report the pathological profile and treatment results in a series of 21 patients with a variety of intracranial tumors, treated in this manner between May 1987 and April 1990. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be a worthwhile procedure for the treatment of well-selected patients with intracranial neoplasms

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1983 proton radiotherapy using 250 MeV proton beams produced by a booster synchrotron of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics has been carried out at Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba. As of September 1990, a total of 147 patients received a partial or full treatment with proton beams with curative intent; 92 patients (63%) were treated with proton beams alone and 55 patients (37%) with combined photon and proton beams. There were 91 males and the mean age was 61.8 years old. The follow-up observation period ranged from 10 to 97 months. With regard to a total tumor dose, nearly 80% of patients received 70 Gy or more and 53% received 80 Gy or more. While dose-fractionations used depended upon tumor sites, the large majority of patients received substantially high radiation doses in terms of larger total doses (> 70 Gy) and larger fraction sizes (> 2.5 Gy) than those traditionally used. This fractionation regimen has been used because of limited availability of the accelerator or a shortage of machine time (27-30 weeks/year, 3-3.5 hr/day), and also by the expectation that the superior dose distribution possible with protons will permit administration of high radiation doses without increasing morbidities. In connection with this, we have determined the target volume by setting margins around the tumor boundary as practically small as possible, ranging from 5 to 10 mm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current trial has been based on a site and dose searching program, hence a wide variety of tumor sites including the aerodigestive organs has been treated. So far, our judgment is that proton therapy has proven of potential advantage in treatment of the lung, esophageal, liver, uterine cervix, prostate, and head and neck malignancies; and of possible value in treatment of high-grade gliomas, and gastric, urinary bladder, and pediatric tumors

Failure to control the primary tumor has been the most common cause for death. Our experience in three patients with small squamous cell cancer of the trachea treated by definitive irradiation is encouraging. The primary tumor was controlled in each patient. Histologic confirmation of tumor sterilization was observed in two. One patient remains alive and well at 54 months; one patient developed an epidural metastases at 16 months and subsequently died; and the third patient developed a separate primary lung cancer at 48 months. Two patients developed significant radiation complications	
1	3077	Locally challenging osteo- and chondrogenic tumors of the axial skeleton: results of combined proton and photon radiation therapy using three-dimensional treatment planning	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biopsy, Bone Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Boston, Child, Chondroblastoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chondrosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Chordoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Cobalt, Eye, Female, Giant Cell Tumors/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Osteosarcoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Recurrence, Research, Risk, Sarcoma, Skull, Survival, Survival Rate	PURPOSE: Tumors of the axial skeleton are at high risk for local failure. Total surgical resection is rarely possible. Critical normal tissues limit the efficacy of conventional photon therapy. This study reviews our experience of using combined high dose proton and photon radiation therapy following three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1980 and September 1992, 47 patients were treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory for primary or recurrent chordomas and chondrosarcomas (group 1, 20 patients), osteogenic sarcomas (group 2, 15 patients) and giant cell tumors, osteo-or chondroblastomas (group 3, 12 patients). Radiation treatment was given postoperatively in 23 patients, pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients, and 7 patients received radiation therapy as definitive treatment modality following biopsy only. The proton radiation component was delivered using a 160 MeV proton beam and the photon component using megavoltage photons up to 23 MV energy with 1.8-2.0 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) per fraction, once a day. Total external beam target dose ranged from 55.3 CGE to 82.0 CGE with mean target doses of 73.9 CGE (group 1), 69.8 CGE (group 2), and 61.8 CGE (group 3). RESULTS: Group 1 (chordoma and chondrosarcoma): Five of 14 patients (36%) with chordoma recurred locally, and 2 out of 5 patients developed distant metastasis, resulting in 1 death from disease. A trend for improved local control was noted for primary vs. recurrent tumors, target doses > 77 CGE and gross total resection. All patients with chondrosarcoma achieved and maintained local control and disease-free status. Five-year actuarial local control and overall survival rates were 53% and 50% for chordomas and 100% and 100% for chondrosarcomas, respectively. Group 2 (osteogenic sarcoma): Three of 15 patients (20%) never achieved local control and died within 6 months of completion of radiation treatment. Only 1 out of 12 patients who were controlled for more than 6 months failed locally, yielding a 5-year local control rate of 59% for 15 patients. Overall, 4 patients (27%) developed distant metastasis (two in patients with uncontrolled primary); 4 patients succumbed to their disease, 3 patients died of intercurrent disease, resulting in overall survival of 44% at 5 years. Group 3 (giant cell tumors, osteo- and chondroblastoma): One of 8 patients with giant cell tumor failed locally, 1 patient distantly, and all patients are alive. Three of 4 patients with osteo- or chondroblastoma are alive and well. One patient suffered local recurrence and died of disease. Local control rate and overall survival for this group of 12 patients was 76% and 87% and local control for patients with giant cell tumors 83% at 5 years. In the majority of cases radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, one patient with a large base of skull tumor developed retinopathy, one patient required enucleation of a previously blind eye, and another patient with sacral tumor developed chronic diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Combined proton and photon radiation therapy optimized by 3D treatment planning, allows the delivery of higher radiation doses to tumors of the axial skeleton, while respecting normal tissue constraints. High radiation doses can result in improved long-term local control

METHODS: A retrospective case series of 15 patients with nonresectable iris melanomas treated with proton beam therapy between August 1998 and August 2004. The main outcome measures were (1) local tumour control, (2) complications, and (3) eye retention. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 11 patients showed documented growth (including two cases of local recurrence following iridocyclectomy) while a further three cases were biopsy-proven melanoma. One patient presented with a newly acquired vascular nodule of the iris associated with angle seeding and glaucoma. Tumour control at mean follow-up of 34 months was 93% (14 of 15 eyes). Common complications included glaucoma in 53% (five patients had glaucoma prior to irradiation), dry eye (27%) and cataract in three patients (20%). Eye retention was possible in 80% (12 cases). CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy is an effective treatment for cases of nonresectable iris melanoma. The major complications are cataract and glaucoma	
0	2108	Comparative risk assessment of secondary cancer incidence after treatment of Hodgkin's disease with photon and proton radiation	Adult, Dose Fractionation, Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Female, Hodgkin Disease/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Incidence, Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Radiation-Induced/et [Etiology], Neoplasms,Second Primary/ep [Epidemiology], Neoplasms,Second Primary/et [Etiology], Nuclear Medicine, Organ Specificity, Photons, Photons/ae [Adverse Effects], Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Probability, Protons, Protons/ae [Adverse Effects], Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy/ae [Adverse Effects], Radiotherapy,High-Energy/mt [Methods], Research, Risk, Risk Assessment, Switzerland	Probabilities for secondary cancer incidence have been estimated for a patient with Hodgkin's disease for whom treatment has been planned with different radiation modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate cancer incidence from dose distributions. For this purpose, target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity-modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. The cancer incidence has been derived from the mean doses for each organ. The results of this work are: (a) Intensity-modulated treatment of Hodgkin's disease using nine photon fields (15 MV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with two opposed photon fields (6 MV). (b) Intensity-modulated treatment using nine proton fields (maximum energy 177.25 MeV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with one proton field (160 MeV). (c) Irradiation with protons using the spot scanning technique decreases the avoidable cancer incidence compared to photon treatment by a factor of about two. This result is independent of the number of beams used. Our work suggests that there are radiotherapy indications in which intensity-modulated treatments will result in little or no reduction of cancer incidence compared to conventional treatments. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment

Analysis of combined data from the 13 patients revealed statistically significant improvement in 5 clinical indicators of disease activity at the end of TLI and 6 and 12 months later, accompanied by T4-specific immunosuppression. Management considerations resulted in the introduction of prednisone therapy in 5 patients, methotrexate in 4, and azathioprine in 1 during the interval of 8-12 months post-TLI. Herpes zoster occurred in 5 patients prior to the initiation of this additional therapy. These data indicate that, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a TLI dose of 2,000 cGy is sufficient to produce measurable benefit that lasts for 6 months, and that the improvement can be maintained at 12 months by the use of prednisone and methotrexate

Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75%). In 50% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed

In extended tumours, ocular surface problems can result after therapy. In this study we examined ocular surface integrity of ten patients who underwent proton beam radiation between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: The patients were examined during their follow-up. Eight of the ten cases who underwent proton radiotherapy were recurrent tumours, which were previously treated with other adjuvant therapies. We performed a standard ophthalmological examination and detailed tear film diagnostics. RESULTS: The follow-up was 17-87 months (mean: 40.9+/-20.1). In six cases more than 50% of the upper and lower eyelids were included in the radiation field. All of these cases showed moderate to severe sicca symptoms. The impression cytology revealed squamous metaplasia of conjunctival cells in nine of ten cases. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelia indicates a radiogenic, persisting disturbance of differentiation of the conjunctival epithelial cells. The tear film instability correlates with the loss of mucin-secreting goblet cells and meibomian gland dysfunction

DESIGN AND SETTING: Nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from June 1992 to October 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. INTERVENTIONS: After histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. Chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 Gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. In both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median Dulguerov T stage of T3 (range, T2 to T4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. Eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. One patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. There have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). Complications were limited and generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with proton radiation has demonstrated initial success in treatment of these tumors. Dramatic response from chemotherapy is possible even in bulky or unresectable disease. This protocol has an acceptable complication rate and conveys less morbidity than craniofacial resection and conventional radiotherapy. Further follow-up will be required to determine the long-term success rate of this therapeutic protocol

In the former case, aneurysm and large AVM in the left visual tuber were causes of 4 hemorrhages. In the latter, AVM of subcortical nodes and internal capsule were responsible for single hemorrhage. The patients underwent intraoperative embolization of the anterior ciliary artery followed by its clipping. This allowed the authors to exclude aneurysm and to achieve obliteration of the bulk of AVM. Operation were performed under intraoperative guidance of motor and speech functions. Residual AVM were exposed to proton beam radiation. The outcomes of treatment were good. After 4 months of surgery, the male had no neurological disorders; in the female motor and speech disorders were associated with prior hemorrhage. [References: 10]

DESIGN: Prospective phase I/II study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FEV(1) < or = 1.0 L were irradiated with protons to areas of gross disease only, using 51 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) in 10 fractions (protocol 1). Fifteen patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and FEV(1) > 1.0 L received 45-Gy photon irradiation to the primary lung tumor and the mediastinum, plus a 28.8-CGE proton boost to the gross tumor volume (protocol 2). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function was evaluated prior to treatment and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 to 12 months following irradiation. RESULTS: In patients receiving protocol 1, no significant changes in pulmonary function occurred. In patients receiving protocol 2, at 6 to 12 months, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide had declined from 61% of predicted to 45% of predicted (p < 0.05), total lung capacity had declined from 114% of predicted to 95% of predicted (p < 0.05), and residual volume had declined from 160% of predicted to 132% of predicted (p < 0.05). Airway resistance increased from 3.8 to 5.2 cm H(2)O/L/s (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes occurred in vital capacity, FEV(1), or PaO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that it is feasible to apply higher-than-conventional doses of radiation at a higher-than-conventional dose per fraction without excess pulmonary toxicity when conformal radiation techniques with protons are used

Eight patients (seven males and one female) were suffering from over-irradiation syndrome as a result of treatments from a malfunctioning linear electron accelerator. The mean accidental estimated dose was 136 Gy delivered to the "open-neck" (seven cases) and to the thoracic wall (one case), during a mean of 5.4 sessions (range 1-9 sessions). Paresthesia and weakness in the upper extremities were the earliest symptoms (87.5 %), with evolution to paralysis in all patients. No patient is alive (mean survival time 64 days). In all cases MRI was negative for neurologic lesions in the acute phase ( < 90 days from irradiation; Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system). Late signs of radiation myelitis manifested as high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images in three patients, and as Gd-DTPA enhancement of T1-weighted images in one case. Autopsies performed on four patients who died in acute phase showed morphologic alterations in white matter: edema in 75 %, and necrosis and glial reaction as well as obliterative vasculitis in all cases. In cases of over-irradiation, MRI may be normal in acute phase even if the patients have severe neurologic deficit, as positive MRI findings appear only in delayed radiation myelitis

However, the late effects of photon radiation compromise function and cosmetic outcome. Proton radiation can provide excellent tumor dose distributions while sparing normal tissues better than photon irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conformal 3D photon and proton radiotherapy plans were generated for children treated with proton irradiation for orbital RMS at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dose-volume histograms (90%, 50%, 10%) were generated and compared for important orbital and central nervous system structures. Average percentages of total dose prescribed were calculated based on the 3 dose-volume histogram levels for normal orbital structures for both the proton and photon plans. The percent of normal tissue spared by using protons was calculated. RESULTS: Seven children were treated for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with proton irradiation and standard chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6.3 years (range, 3.5-9.7 years). Local and distant controls compare favorably to those in other published accounts. There was an advantage in limiting the dose to the brain, pituitary, hypothalamus, temporal lobes, and ipsilateral and contralateral orbital structures. Tumor size and location affect the degree of sparing of normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital RMS. Proton therapy maintains excellent tumor coverage while reducing the radiation dose to adjacent normal structures. Proton radiation therapy minimizes long-term side effects

This report reviews the treatment of four pediatric patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumor, using fractionated and combined, conformal proton and photon radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients and one adolescent male, ages 10-15 years, had undergone prior, extensive surgical resection(s) and were treated for either primary (two patients) or recurrent (two patients) disease. Gross residual tumor was evident in three patients and microscopic disease suspected in one patient. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was based on three-dimensional (3-D) planning, consisting of fractionated treatment, one fraction per day at 1.8 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent) to total target doses of 57.6, 57.6, 59.4, and 61.2 Gy/CGE. RESULTS: With observation times of 3.1 years, 3.3, 5.3, and 5.8 years, all four patients were alive and well and remained locally controlled without evidence of recurrent disease. Except for one patient with partial pituitary insufficiency following radiotherapy for sellar recurrent disease, thus far no late effects attributable to radiation therapy have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3-D-conformal radiation therapy offers a realistic chance of tumor control for aggressive giant cell tumor in the skull base, either postoperatively or at time of recurrence. Conformal treatment techniques allow the safe delivery of relatively high radiation doses in the pediatric patient without apparent increase of side effects

Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators

A total of 39 evaluable patients were treated with curative intent using either fast neutrons alone or in combination with low LET irradiation as part of a mixed beam fractionation scheme. Actuarial survival curves are presented for both the "neutrons alone" and the "mixed beam" treatment groups. There was no significant survival difference between these groups of patients. The projected survival at two years is less than 10%, which is comparable with megavoltage photon results for an unselected series of patients. The size of the primary lesion and the initial Karnofsky performance status were found to be the most important prognostic indications for prolonged survival. Sixteen of 39 patients were felt to have achieved local clearance of their tumor at some time during their follow-up with the median time until a local recurrence being 17 months. Treatment related complications and patterns of metastatic spread are discussed. In general, it appeared that the response of large tumors to neutron irradiation resulted in necrosis and fistula formation. In many cases this was accompanied by persistent/recurrent tumor within the high dose radiation volume

In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72%/84% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment

Endoresection of the tumour after proton beam irradiation, is an alternative approach, aiming to reduce the incidence of ocular morbidity caused by tumour necrosis after sole radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with large uveal melanomas (mean tumour thickness: 9.1 mm, mean tumour volume: 0.77 cc), received a primary proton beam irradiation (60 CGE) and underwent subsequent endoresection via a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The median pretreatment visual acuity was 0.2. The mean follow-up was 13.9 months. RESULTS: The postoperative visual acuity after 12 months was 0.12 (median, mean visual acuity loss 0.08). The probability of developing radiation retinopathy or papillopathy within the first year after treatment was 35% and 28% respectively and the probability of enucleation was 9% within the first postoperative year. No tumour recurrences were observed and 2 patients developed liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Endoresection following irradiation of large uveal melanomas located close to the optic nerve and/ or the fovea seems to be a useful and safe alternative to the traditional irradiation or enucleation. The incidence of complications following our approach seems to be lower when compared to radiation alone, where tumour necrosis is a substantial problem

Twenty one patients were treated for cerebrovascular abnormalities and 23 patients were treated for intracranial tumors. Fifteen of the 23 patients treated for intracranial tumors had received previous radiotherapy. The range of doses given by radiosurgery was 1000-2500 cGy. Nausea and vomiting occurred in seven patients within six hours of treatment. The incidence and symptoms were correlated with the dose of radiation to the vomiting center (area postrema) with the median dose to the postrema in symptomatic patients being 618 cGy compared to a range of less than 5 to 184 cGy in the remaining 36 asymptomatic patients. Temporary alopecia occurred in a single patient who received 400 cGy to the scalp. Alopecia did not occur in the remaining 43 patients who received from less than 5 to 175 cGy. Two patients treated for arteriovenous malformations developed an enhancing lesion on CT scanning (one with cerebral edema) on follow-up CT scanning six and twenty-eight months following radiosurgery. The location of these enhancing lesions corresponded to the volumes treated. In one patient, the enhancing pattern and edema disappeared within 18 months of treatment and no neurological deficits developed. Aphasia occurred in one patient treated for a recurrent glioma two hours following treatment to the left temporal lobe and cleared within 12 h of radiosurgery. One patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the pons developed weakness of the contralateral arm and leg six weeks following treatment and this has slowly resolved over the last 12 months. In conclusion, the complications to date have been self-limited and appear to be directly related to the dose and area of brain treated. Prior radiation therapy has not been associated with increased risk of complication in patients treated with radiosurgery for recurrent tumors to date

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 349 patients with choroidal melanoma referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre underwent proton beam radiotherapy at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) between January 1993 and December 2003. Four daily fractions of proton beam radiotherapy were delivered, with a total dose of 53.1 proton Gy, and with lateral and distal safety margins of 2.5 mm. Outcomes measured were local tumor recurrence; ocular conservation; vision; and metastatic death according to age, gender, eye, visual acuity, location of anterior and posterior tumor margins, quadrant, longest basal tumor dimension, tumor height, extraocular extension, and retinal invasion. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates were 3.5% for local tumor recurrence, 9.4% for enucleation, 79.1% for conservation of vision of counting fingers or better, 61.1% for conservation of vision of 20/200 or better, 44.8% for conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, and 10.0% for death from metastasis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam radiotherapy with a 62 MeV cyclotron achieves high rates of local tumor control and ocular conservation, with visual outcome depending on tumor size and location

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. RESULTS: At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum. With the use of small-angle lateral-oblique fields in 3D-CPT and IMPT, the rectal V70 was reduced by up to 35% compared with the standard lateral configuration, whereas the bladder V70 increased by less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In the range higher than 60 Gy/CGE, IMRT achieved significantly better sparing of the bladder, whereas rectal sparing was similar with 3D-CPT and IMRT. Dose to healthy tissues in the range lower than 50% of the target prescription was substantially lower with proton therapy

Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases

[Russian]	Aged, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Physics, Prostatic Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Protons, Radiation, Radiation Injuries, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy,High-Energy	The proton beam of the 157 MeV synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was modified for irradiation of prostatic cancer patients. Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year

Detailed results have been published previously [17]. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1972 and 1993, 57 patients were treated curatively with radiation alone (n = 13) or combined surgery and pre- and/or postoperative irradiation (n = 44). Gross complete resection was achieved in 82% of patients and margins were negative in 5 patients. Doses ranged from 36.0 to 79.2 Gy (median 64.8 Gy), usually conventionally fractionated. In 16 patients protons were used. Median follow-up time was 4.3 years (range 1.1 to 16.8 years). RESULTS: After 5 years, patients with angiosarcomas (n = 11) and patients with other tumor types (n = 46) had locoregional control rates of 24% and 69%, distant failure rates of 58% and 17%, and overall survival rates of (for overall survival) and T stage (for locoregional control) (p < 0.05). Particularly, gross completely resected T1 tumors had a locoregional control rate of 91%. Patients with locoregional recurrence were at an increased risk to die (p = 0.004 in multivariate analysis). Patients with and without direct tumor extension to neurovascular structures, bones, organs, or skin had distant failure rates of 27% and 0%, respectively (p = 0.031). In multivariate analysis, direct extension was additionally a negative prognosticator of overall survival (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: 1. Angiosarcomas of the head and neck have a considerably poorer prognosis than other soft tissue sarcomas of this region. 2. Head and neck sarcomas have a higher local recurrence rate than for example soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. Optimisation of local treatment through combination of surgery and high-dose irradiation, however, can achieve improved results, especially for prognostically favourable subgroups. 3. In addition to tumor grade and size, direct tumor extension may be a useful additional staging parameter

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84% and 77%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS

Temozolomide has shown antineoplastic activity against malignant gliomas and more recently was beneficial in one patient with gliomatosis cerebri. To make an objective assessment of the effect of long-term temozolomide administration in a patient with gliomatosis cerebri we used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural MRI. A 46-year-old man with gliomatosis cerebri was treated with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 28 days). Twenty cycles of temozolomide resulted in a marked reduction in choline and scyllo-inositol content, as detected using brain proton MR spectroscopy, indicating reduced tumor cellularity and/or growth rate. Neurochemical improvements were associated with normalization of the signal intensity in most of the previously affected cerebral regions and regression of mass effect on MRI. A left pyramidal syndrome, present at the start of the treatment, disappeared. Our observation lends support to larger clinical trials evaluating the use of temozolomide to treat this brain tumor	
0	4663	Proton therapy of uveal melanomas: intercomparison of MRI-based and conventional treatment planning	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Berlin, Eye, Female, Germany, Humans, Lead, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Melanoma, Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Middle Aged, Patients, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Risk, Safety, Tantalum, Tomography,X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton therapy for uveal melanoma provides high-conformal dose application to the target volume and, thus, an optimal saving of the organs at risk nearby. Treatment planning is done with the model-based treatment-planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume (CTV). The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy-planning system by using the novel image-based treatment-planning system OCTOPUS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high-resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker clips for submillimeter positioning and additional information from ultrasound and 3-D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3-D imaging (e. g., CT, MRI). CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs (EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS) were compared intraindividually. RESULTS: OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume by a factor of 1.7 (T1-weighted [T1w]) and 2.2 (T2w) without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1.2 (T1w) and 1.4 (T2w), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI-based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity

However, the survival of severe cirrhotic patients has recently improved due to advanced treatments. The aim of this study was to define the role of proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis received proton beam therapy. The hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in five, and the tumor size was 25-80 mm (median 40 mm) in maximum diameter. No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 50-84 Gy (median 72 Gy) in ten to 24 fractions (median 16) were delivered to the tumors. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, six, eight and four died of cancer, liver failure and intercurrent diseases, respectively, during the follow-up period of 3-63 months (median 17 months) after treatment. A remaining patient was alive with no evidence of disease 33 months after treatment. All but one of irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Ten patients had new intrahepatic tumors outside the irradiated volume. The overall and progression-free survival rates were 53% and 47% at 1 year, respectively, and 42% each at 2 years. Performance status and Child-Pugh score were significant prognostic factors for survival. Therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was not observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis was tolerable. It may improve survival for patients with relatively good general condition and liver function

The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads

This assumption was also supported by positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET). In contrast, proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) indicated radiation necrosis, which was confirmed histopathologically in surgical specimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48). RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC

Moderate to severe losses were noted in patients producing voice with all types of alaryngeal modalities: tracheoesophageal, esophageal, and electrolaryngeal. Voice and speech losses were related to the impaired motility and vibratory capability of the esophageal wall and mucosa, to fibrosis of the submandibular region and to trismus. Tracheoesophageal and esophageal voice was recovered some weeks after completion of irradiation. No voice losses were observed in alaryngeal speakers who did not undergo voice restoration until after irradiation. All irradiated patients also showed various degrees of dysphagia during the treatment

0	4220	Clinical value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for differentiating recurrent or residual brain tumor from delayed cerebral necrosis	Adolescent, Biopsy, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Child, Child,Preschool, Diagnostic Imaging, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Methods, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Neoplasm,Residual, Radiotherapy/ae [Adverse Effects], Research, Risk, Sensitivity and Specificity	PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral necrosis (DN) is a significant risk for brain tumor patients treated with high-dose irradiation. Although differentiating DN from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging techniques. We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to differentiate prospectively between DN or recurrent/residual tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve children (ages 3-16 years), who had clinical and MR imaging (MRI) changes that suggested a diagnosis of either DN or progressive/recurrent brain tumor, underwent localized 1H MRS prior to planned biopsy, resection, or other confirmatory histological procedure. Prospective 1H MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from normalized spectra: a marked depression of the intracellular metabolite peaks from choline, creatine, and N-acetyl compounds was hypothesized to indicate DN, and median-to-high choline with easily visible creatine metabolite peaks was labeled progressive/recurrent tumor. Subsequent histological studies identified the brain lesion as DN or recurrent/residual tumor. RESULTS: The patient series included five cases of DN and seven recurrent/residual tumor cases, based on histology. The MRS criteria prospectively identified five out of seven patients with active tumor, and four out of five patients with histologically proven DN correctly. Discriminant analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for differentiating DN from tumor lay in the normalized MRS peak areas for choline and creatine compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for differentiating DN from recurrent/progressive brain tumor. A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for choline and creatine compounds may provide a simple discriminant for differentiating DN from recurrent or residual primary brain tumors

Prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck is a criterion of treatment for these patients. But some authors suggest to prophylactically irradiate the the whole neck. This study was to analyze and compare long-term outcomes of the N0-NPC patients treated by prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck and to the whole neck, and explore radiotherapy on neck for N0-NPC patients. METHODS: A total of 178 N0-NPC patients, proved by pathology, were treated in our hospital from Jul. 1998 to Dec. 1999. Of the 178 patients, 88 received prophylactic irradiation to the upper neck (upper neck group), 90 received prophylactic irradiation to the whole neck (whole neck group). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze and compare survival rate of the 2 groups. Cox model was used to study prognostic factors of N0-NPC. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 90.9%, and 80.7% in upper neck group, and 97.8%, 80.0%, and 71.1% in whole neck group (P = 0.224). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 93.2%, 80.7%, and 77.3% in upper neck group, and 85.6%, 68.9%, and 64.4% in whole neck group (P = 0.163). The incidence of cervical lymph nodes recurrence was 1.14% in upper neck group, and 1.09% in whole neck group (P> 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, and short-term outcome were independent prognostic factors of N0-NPC. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic irradiation to upper neck is recommended for N0-NPC patients

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 53 intracranial AVMs treated between 1991-1998. HFSR was selected for 26 AVMs with a maximum diameter > or 2.5 cm or at eloquent area. Twenty-seven patients were treated with SRS (18 AVMs < 2.5 cm at non-eloquent area, nine patients who were unfit for prolonged ring-wearing). The most frequent minimum dose (Dmin) was 20 Gy for SRS and 28 Gy for HFSR in four fractions. The mean follow-up duration was 34.6 months for SRS and 35.4 months for HFSR. RESULTS: As a whole, the 3 and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 64 and 92%. Age <20 years old (P=0.02) and a maximum diameter <2 cm were favorable factors (P=0.05). A difference in the distribution of patients was observed in size (> or =2.5 cm or not) (P<0.001) and location (eloquent or not) (P<0.001) between SRS and HFSR due to the treatment selection. However, no significant differences were observed in the actuarial rates of obliteration and transient increased signals with T2-weighted MR images between SRS and HFSR. Radiation necrosis occurred in two patients treated with SRS and in none with HFSR. Intracranial hemorrhage after treatment happened in two treated with SRS and three with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: HFSR appears to be at least as effective as SRS in achieving complete obliteration of intracranial AVM, although its definitive role remains to be investigated

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and December 2002, 152 patients were treated at GSI with carbon ion RT. Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions. RESULTS: Actuarial 3-year local control was 81% for chordomas, 100% for chondrosarcomas, and 62% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas

One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional CT sets for 10 lung cancer patients were used in this study. The internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) was obtained by combining the tumor volumes at different phases of the respiratory cycle. For each patient, we evaluated four planning strategies based on the following dose calculations: (1) the average (AVE) CT; (2) the free-breathing (FB) CT; (3) the maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT; and (4) the AVE CT in which the CT voxel values inside the IGTV were replaced by a constant density (AVE_RIGTV). For each strategy, the resulting cumulative dose distribution in a respiratory cycle was determined using a deformable image registration method. RESULTS: There were dosimetric differences between the apparent dose distribution, calculated on a single CT dataset, and the motion-corrected 4D dose distribution, calculated by combining dose distributions delivered to each phase of the 4DCT. The AVE_RIGTV plan using a 1-cm smearing parameter had the best overall target coverage and critical structure sparing. The MIP plan approach resulted in an unnecessarily large treatment volume. The AVE and FB plans using 1-cm smearing did not provide adequate 4D target coverage in all patients. By using a larger smearing value, adequate 4D target coverage could be achieved; however, critical organ doses were increased. CONCLUSION: The AVE_RIGTV approach is an effective strategy for designing proton treatment plans for mobile lung tumors

The authors conducted a retrospective review to determine the role of proton beam therapy in the treatment of patients who had HCC with PVTT. METHODS: Twelve patients with HCC who had tumor thrombus in the main trunk or major branches of the portal vein (clinical T3-T4N0M0) were treated with proton beam therapy. At the time they received proton beam irradiation, patients ranged in age from 42 years to 80 years (median, 62 years), and their tumors ranged in size from 40 mm to 110 mm (median, 60 mm) in greatest dimension. A total dose of 50-72 gray (Gy) (median, 55 Gy) in 10-22 fractions was delivered to the tumors, including PVTT. RESULTS: All tumors that were treated with proton beam therapy remained controlled at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.3 years). Among 12 patients, 10 patients had new liver tumors outside the irradiated volume 0.1-2.4 years after proton beam therapy, and 3 patients also had distant metastases; consequently, 8 patients died of disease, and 2 patients were salvaged by further therapies. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 4.3 years and 6.4 years after proton beam therapy. The progression-free survival rates were 67% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 years. According to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), therapy-related toxicity > or = Grade 3 was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC who had PVTT was feasible and effective. It appeared to improve survival and local control significantly for these patients

These factors were quantified because they may be extremely important in the development of side effects, and the treated volume integral dose may be crucial in inducing them. METHODS: Of the 12 participating patients, 6 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 with adenocarcinoma received combined photon/proton beam radiation, whereas 2 with SCC and 1 with large-cell carcinoma (LCC) received only proton radiation. Mean age was 73.6 years. There were 4 male and 8 female patients with a mean smoking history of 87.0 packyears. Nine patients had Stage I, 2 had Stage II, and 1 had stage IIIA lung cancer. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and on Days 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 after initiation of radiation therapy. Injury scores for pneumonitis and fibrosis based on computed tomography (CT) scans were assigned. RESULTS: The percentage of lung volume irradiated was significantly less for patients treated with protons alone compared with those receiving photon plus proton therapy (p < 0.001). Injury scores were also lower for proton only treatment (p = 0.039). When evaluated collectively, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in the photon/proton group (p < 0.05 or less); radiation regimen, but not time after treatment initiation, was a significant factor in their levels. P III P level was also higher in the photon/proton patients (p < 0.001) and both radiation regimen (p = 0.027) and time after treatment (p = 0.019) had an impact. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant changes occurred in some of the measured cytokines and P III P, it was the difference in the volume integral dose that occurred when protons were used alone vs. mixed photon/proton therapy that correlated with the incidence of pneumonitis and/or fibrosis. However, it cannot be ruled out that differences in cytokine levels before radiotherapy initiation may have contributed to the outcome

Each patient received five proton beam treatments in eight to ten days, totalling 4,730 to 8,570 rads at the tumor. No complications occurred during the treatment or follow-up period, which, at the time of this writing, ranges from one to 24 months, with an average of 12 months. No further growth of the tumor has been observed in any patient. Different signs of tumor regression have been noted. Resolution of the serous retinal detachments that accompanied some tumors is the earliest finding. Pigment changes over the surface of the tumor and adjacent pigment epithelium is a usual initial tumor response. Fluorescein angiography initially showed decreased leakage of dye; later, destruction of the tumor's vasculature and elimination of fluorescein leakage became evident. Only large choroidal vessels remained patient. Ultrasonography revealed decreased height of the tumors postirradiation, and the radioactive phosphorus (32P) uptake test, repeated in one patient, turned negative on postirradiation measurements

We compared the actual (clinical) response with the predicted response estimated using our past experimental and clinical data, and discussed some problems to be overcome in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted an intravenous drip infusion of the compound whereby 170 mg/kg of the drug was administered over 4-5 hours before neutron irradiation. The patient was then irradiated with thermal neutrons from the Musashi Reactor at a reactor power of 100 kW and a neutron flux of 1.0 x 10(9) n/cm2/s at the collimator surface. The total absorbed dose to the melanoma and the surrounding skin was calculated by multiplying the thermal neutron fluences by the conversion factor. RESULTS: The total absorbed doses to the melanoma and the surrounding normal skin were calculated as 19.0 and 9.4 Gy, respectively. These absorbed doses were estimated at 33.5 and 14.2 RBE-Gy, respectively, assuming that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the high LET radiations was 2.0 and that each component of the mixed radiation was simply additive. The melanoma showed marked regression with mild skin reaction (dry desquamation) a month after therapy, and finally disappeared 10 months after therapy. There were no no substantial side effects. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the outcome of our calculated dose values agreed well with the clinical response and that their compatibility indicated considerable validity for our approach. However, there are still some problems-uncertainty concerning the 10B concentration in tumor and skin, determination of the total absorbed dose, and a single curative dose for malignant melanoma-to be overcome with regard to clinical use of this therapy

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy

PATIENTS, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: In 41 patients irradiated for unilateral breast cancer the regular scoring by CTC was done during radiotherapy. In parallel, a total of 4,920 spectrophotometric measurements to determine the skin color were performed at baseline, at the beginning of radiotherapy, and at 20, 40 and 60 Gy. The nonirradiated contralateral breast was used for control measurements. RESULTS: As expected, the skin color (especially red) depended on the radiation dose applied to the skin. The objective spectrophotometric measurements were found to correlate well with the subjective CTC scores. CONCLUSION: For classification of acute radiation toxicity there seems to be no need to replace the common CTC scoring by technical methods

We have treated 54 patients with ciliary body melanoma using helium ions from 1978 to 1985. Because of the high rate of metastatic disease, the 5-year disease specific survival rate is only 59% despite a 5-year local control rate of 98%. The greatest diameter of the tumor was predictive of loss of vision and enucleation (p = .05, p = .04, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the greatest diameter of the tumor was the most important predictor of death from metastases. The incidence of neovascular glaucoma at 5 years is 43%. The 5-year actuarial rate of enucleation is 26%. Enucleation was done for pain and/or neovascular glaucoma. Univariate analysis showed treatment volume to be a statistically significant predictor for the development of neovascular glaucoma (p = .0017) and enucleation (p = .0078). Seventy percent of neovascular glaucoma occurred in patients with treatment volume greater than 5.5 cc. Seventy-four percent occurred in patients with an initial ultrasound height greater than 9.2 mm. Using this information, patients at high risk for neovascular glaucoma could be considered for prophylactic treatment with panretinal photocoagulation

Gamma-ray radiation was used for comparison. The results of standard colony formation assay showed that the survival fraction of each cell line decreased in an LET-dependent manner. The results of other direct cytotoxic assays, dye exclusion test, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, also displayed a similar relationship between the cytotoxic effect of carbon beams and LET. The maximum values of the cell death index (CDI) were 50.2% in A172 and 37.5% in TK1, both obtained on day 7 after exposure to carbon beams of 80 keV/microm. Apoptosis was observed only on days 4 and 7 after carbon beam irradiation, with maximum values of 7% in A172 and 4.5% in TK1, and the induction of apoptosis after high-LET radiation could be p53-independent. This indicated that a combination of multiple assays to detect cell death was important in evaluating the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, because this approach could more precisely reflect the clinical effectiveness of radiotherapy	
0	136	Comparative treatment planning between proton and x-ray therapy in esophageal cancer	Aged, Carcinoma,Squamous Cell/rt [Radiotherapy], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models,Biological, Probability, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Research, X-Rays	PURPOSE: Conformal treatment planning with megavoltage x-rays and protons for five patients with esophageal cancer has been studied in an attempt to determine if there are advantages of using protons instead of x-rays. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the five patients, two different proton plans, one x-ray plan, and one mixed plan with x-rays and protons were made. A three-dimensional treatment planning system, TMS, was used. The evaluation of the different plans was made by applying the tumor control probability (TCP) model proposed by Nahum and Webb and the normal tissue complication (NTCP) model proposed by Lyman on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: The comparison shows advantages of using protons instead of x-rays for all five patients. The dose-limiting organs at risk are the spinal cord, the lungs, and the heart, but the proton plans also spare the kidneys better than the x-ray plan does. At 5% NTCP in any risk organ, the calculated mean TCP value for the five patients is increased by an average of 20%-units (from 2 to 23%-units) with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. However, if we assume maximally a 1% risk in the spinal cord and a total NTCP for the two lungs of 100%, the mean TCP value for the five patients is increased from 6 to 49% with the best proton plan compared with x-rays only. The corresponding figure for the mixed plan is 27%. These gains are relatively insensitive to variations within reasonable limits in the biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have clear therapeutic advantages over conventional external radiotherapy when treating esophageal carcinoma	
1	2516	15 years experience with helium ion radiotherapy for uveal melanoma	California, Californium, Ciliary Body, Eye, Eye Enucleation, Follow-Up Studies, Helium, Helium/tu [Therapeutic Use], Humans, Melanoma, Melanoma/mo [Mortality], Melanoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Methods, Morbidity, Optic Nerve, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Risk, Survival, Time, Universities, Uveal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Uveal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Vision, Vision Disorders/et [Etiology]	PURPOSE: To review the long-term experience of helium ion therapy as a therapeutic alternative to enucleation for uveal melanoma, particularly with respect to survival, local control, and morbidity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 347 patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion RT from 1978-1992. A nonrandomized dose-searching study was undertaken, with doses progressively reduced from 80 GyE in five fractions to 48 GyE in four fractions, given in 3-15 days, mean of 7 days. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with no difference in the rate of local control being seen at 80, 70, 60, or 50 GyE in five fractions. At the lowest dose level of 48 GyE in four fractions, the local control rate fell to 87%. Fifteen of 347 patients (4%) had local regrowth in the eye requiring enucleation (12 patients), laser (1 patient) or reirradiation (2 patients). The time of appearance of local regrowth ranged from 4 months to 5 years posttreatment, with 85% occurring within 3 years. Of the 347 patients, 208 are alive as of May 1, 1997. The median follow up of all patients is 8.5 years, range 1-17 years. Kaplan-Maier (K-M) survival is 80% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years, and 72% at 15 years posttreatment. Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body have a 15-year K-M survival of 80%. The results for patients whose tumors involved the ciliary body are poor, with a 15-year K-M survival of 43%. Seventy-five percent of patients with tumors at least 3.0 mm from the fovea and optic nerve, and initial ultrasound height less than 6.0 mm, retained vision of 20/200 or better posttreatment. Patients with tumors larger than 6 mm in thickness, or with tumors lying close to the optic nerve or fovea, have a reduced chance of retaining useful vision. The enucleation rate is 19%, 3% for local failure and 16% because of complications of the helium RT, particularly neovascular glaucoma, which occurred in 35% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and retention of the eye are excellent. Complications of therapy reduce vision and eye preservation. Twenty-four percent of patients manifested distant metastases 6 to 146 months posttreatment, mean of 43 months, median of 36 months. Late-appearing distant metastases do not appear to be caused by persistent tumor in the eye. The risk of metastases is high for patients with tumors greater than 7 mm in initial ultrasound height (37%), anterior tumors involving the ciliary body (47%), and in those with local failure (53%). Patients with tumors not involving the ciliary body and initial dimensions less than 10 mm had only an 8% chance of death from melanoma. A search for effective adjuvant therapy is needed for patients at high risk of metastases (large tumors, ciliary body involved, local regrowth in eye)

Microscopic examination did not show any connection to the primary tumor. The different possibilities of pathogenesis (bloodborn metastasis to the same globe, episcleral metastasis by conjunctival lymphatics, surgical dissemination due to the suturing of tantalum marks around the primary tumor) are discussed. The ciliary melanoma has spread over the iris despite the irradiation, probably as a result of insufficient irradiation of its anterior border. The results of histologic examination of the partially necrotic, partially viable irradiated tumor are considered with regard to the conservative tumor therapy administered

The treatable protocol depth (TPD) was utilized as an evaluation index. MCNP-4B calculations were performed for near-threshold (7)Li(p,n)(7)Be at a proton energy of 1.900MeV and for a polyethylene BDE. Consequently, the TPD was increased by increasing T/N ratio, i.e., the ratio of the (10)B concentration in the tumor ((10)B(Tumor)) to that in the normal tissue ((10)B(Normal)), and by increasing (10)B(Tumor) and (10)B(Normal) for constant T/N ratio. It has been found that the BDE becomes unnecessary from the viewpoint of increasing the TPD, when (10)B(Tumor) is over a certain level

The symptoms may subside spontaneously, but often persist. Treatment is usually by local injection of a corticosteroid, orthopedic devices or other standard treatment. If these methods fail, X-ray treatment may be considered. The efficacy of radiotherapy of the calcaneal spur was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1981 through December 1991, 18 patients with painful heel were irradiated mostly with the caesium or telecobalt unit, usually with a dose of 4 times 0.5 Gy. Among these patients, 12 could be followed up during a prolonged period on the basis of questionnaires. RESULTS: According to the categories of v. Pannewitz 17% of the patients were pain-free by the end of the treatment course, 22% showed marked improvement, 33% showed improvement and in 28% the pain was not influenced. Over an average of 41.5 months 58% of the patients reported freedom from pain. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiotherapy appears to relieve the painful heel syndrome in a high proportion of patients. The overall treatment risk appears to be very small. The mechanism of low-dose radiotherapy is unknown	
0	4617	Radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: from palliation to cure. [Review] [85 refs]	Canada, Carcinoma, Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/rt [Radiotherapy], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/sc [Secondary], Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/th [Therapy], Chemoembolization,Therapeutic, Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Liver Neoplasms/pa [Pathology], Liver Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Liver Neoplasms/th [Therapy], Ontario, Pain, Palliative Care, Patients, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy,Conformal, Research, Societies, Survival, Universities	Technologic advances have provided the means to deliver tumoricidal doses of radiation therapy (RT) to patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) while avoiding critical normal tissues, providing the opportunity to use RT for curative intent treatment of HCC. For the current report, the expanded role of external beam RT in the setting of HCC from palliation to cure was reviewed. A systematic literature search was undertaken using the MEDLINE data base and secondary references to identify peer-reviewed, English-language articles that reported clinical outcomes after external beam RT alone or in combination with other treatments for HCC. Abstracts from the 2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, American Gastrointestinal Association, and Society of Surgical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium also were included in the search. More than 60 articles reporting on clinical outcomes among patients who received RT for HCC have been published since 1990, including 20 articles that described unique sets of at least 15 patients. RT was used for palliation, to improve local control, and with curative intent in a wide spectrum of patients who most often were unsuitable for surgery and other treatments. Pain reduction following RT was noted in approximately 75% of patients with bone metastases from HCC who received RT. For patients with liver-confined disease treated with conformal RT, proton beam RT, and/or image guided RT with or without transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), local control response rates ranged from 40% to 90%, and the median survival ranges from 10 months to 25 months. For patients with HCC who had portal vein thrombus, the median survival after RT to treat the thrombus and/or the hepatic tumor with or without TACE ranged from 5.3 months to 9.7 months. Although outcomes after high-dose conformal RT for liver-confined HCC were excellent, the potential survival benefit of RT should be tested in randomized controlled trials that require international collaboration. 2006 American Cancer Society [References: 85]	
0	1997	Conformal proton radiation therapy of the posterior fossa: a study comparing protons with three-dimensional planned photons in limiting dose to auditory structures	Child, Child,Preschool, Cochlea, Ear,Inner, Ear,Middle, Hearing, Humans, Infant, Infratentorial Neoplasms/ra [Radiography], Infratentorial Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Photons, Photons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Physics, Protons, Protons/tu [Therapeutic Use], Radiation, Radiometry, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Conformal/mt [Methods], Temporal Lobe, Universities	PURPOSE: Conventional radiation therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors can cause sequelae such as hearing loss and impairments in language and learning. Modern three-dimensional (3D) treatment techniques have improved dose conformity to the posterior fossa. This report compares the normal tissue dose-sparing capabilities of proton radiation therapy (PRT) with 3D conformal photon plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine children underwent previous PRT for primary CNS malignancies. Using original planning CT scans, the posterior fossa, inner and middle ear, and temporal lobes were delineated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were generated for protons and photons. Normal tissue exposures were calculated by averaging mean doses received and by analysis of dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: The 95% isodose encompassed the posterior fossa in all plans. Normal structures received markedly less radiation from PRT plans than from 3D photon plans. The cochlea received an average mean of 25 +/- 4% of the prescribed dose from PRT, and 75 +/- 6% from photons. Forty percent of temporal lobe volume was completely excluded using protons; with photons 90% of the temporal lobe received 31% of the dose. CONCLUSION: PRT resulted in increased dose sparing of normal structures analyzed. Posterior fossa conformity of 3D photons came at the expense of increasing amounts of normal tissue receiving low to moderate doses

A high alpha 1-antitrypsin level and a normal alpha 2-macroglobulin level were found in all the breast cancer patients. An increase in both blood serum inhibitors was detected in hypophyseal adenoma. The dependence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin content on a subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spread was revealed in the course of 2 years following "hypophysectomy" in the patients with disseminated breast cancer. In the hypophyseal adenoma patients the activity of both inhibitors returned to normal 1 year after treatment and remained within normal during 3 years of follow-up. It was regarded as a positive therapeutic effect. The above findings make it possible to propose the determination of the activity af alpha 1-antitrypsin in breast cancer and alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in hypophyseal adenoma as an additional test for the evaluation of the results of proton "hypophysectomy"

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a linear accelerator synchronized with a fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking system by which 3D coordinates of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the tumor can be determined every 0.03 second. The 3D relationships between the marker and the tumor at different respiratory phases are evaluated using CT image at each respiratory phase, whereby the optimum phase can be selected to synchronize with irradiation (4D treatment planning). The linac is triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the region of the planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. RESULTS: The coordinates of the marker were detected with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm during radiotherapy in the phantom experiment. The time delay between recognition of the marker position and the start or stop of megavoltage X-ray irradiation was 0.03 second. Fourteen patients with various tumors were treated by conformal radiotherapy with a "tight" planning target volume (PTV) margin. They were surviving without relapse or complications with a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy following 4D treatment planning was developed and shown to be feasible to improve the accuracy of the radiotherapy for mobile tumors

Most patients had large melanomas; no eyes containing small melanomas developed anterior segment neovascularization. The mean onset of glaucoma was 14.1 months (range, 7-31 months). The incidence of anterior segment neovascularization increased with radiation dosage; there was an approximately three-fold increase at 80 GyE versus 60 GyE of helium ion radiation (23% vs. 8.5%) (P less than 0.05). Neovascular glaucoma occurred more commonly in larger tumors; the incidence was not affected by tumor location, presence of subretinal fluid, nor rate of tumor regression. Fifty-three percent of patients had some response with intraocular pressures of 21 mmHg or less to a combination of antiglaucoma treatments	
1	2669	CO2 reactivity in arteriovenous malformations of the brain: a transcranial Doppler ultrasound study.[see comment]	Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Brain, California, Californium, Carbon, Carbon Dioxide/bl [Blood], Cerebral Arteries/pp [Physiopathology], Female, Hemodynamics, Humans, Hypocapnia/pp [Physiopathology], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/bl [Blood], Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/us [Ultrasonography], Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Partial Pressure, Pressure, Radiation, Reference Values, Ultrasonography, Ultrasonography,Doppler,Transcranial, Universities	Arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) are congenital tangles of vessels that have a high blood flow through a low-resistance nidus. The vessels in the nidus may lack normal vasoreactivity in response to changes in PaCO2 or perfusion pressure (autoregulation). Arteriovenous malformation hemodynamics have been assessed based on the response of AVM feeding arteries to hypocapnia. Twenty-five AVM patients, aged 34 +/- 11 years (mean +/- standard deviation), were admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital for proton-beam radiation therapy. Fourteen healthy volunteers aged 30 +/- 7 years served as control subjects. Angiograms with calibrated markers permitting magnification correction were available for all patients. The limits of the middle cerebral artery, as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, were compared to measurements made on the angiograms. Hyperventilation was induced at a rate set by a metronome. Fixed bilateral Doppler probes allowed almost simultaneous sampling of two vessels. Volunteer control subjects were hyperventilated in two steps. The two PaCO2 step decreases were significant (mean resting PaCO2 40.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, Step 1 level 29.4 +/- 3.5 mm Hg and Step 2 level 23.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg; p < 0.01). These decreases induced a significant decrease in mean flow velocity (Vm) and an increase in the pulsatility index (p < 0.001). Mean carbon dioxide reactivity (% delta Vm/delta PaCO2) was 2.74 +/- 1.0 for Step 1 and 1.44 +/- 1.8 for Step 2 (p < 0.003). The mean PaCO2 decrease in patients was from 39.5 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 27.0 +/- 3.5 mm Hg. Carbon dioxide reactivity was 0.92 +/- 1.12 for feeding vessels and 2.59 +/- 1.78 for nonfeeding vessels (p < 0.001). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and angiographic depth measurements correlated well. Hyperventilation induced significantly more hemodynamic changes in control and nonfeeding middle cerebral arteries than in feeding vessels. Impaired CO2 reactivity may help to identify AVM feeding vessels as well as the relative magnitude of the flow provided to the malformation

The tumors of all patients were histologically confirmed. A 45 MV betatron was used for radiation of the clipped tumor volume plus a 1 to 2 cm margin. Fourteen patients were treated by a three-field technic with the use of opposed lateral photon beams and an anterior mixed photon-electron beam. Five patients were treated with either a four-field "box" or a three-field photon technic. Tumor doses of 5,900 to 6,700 r were delivered over seven to nine weeks. The twelve month survival rate after diagnosis is 53%. This compares favorably with published reports of patients treated surgically for cure. Four patients are alive 18.5 to 64 months after diagnosis. Three are clinically free of disease. Treatment has been well tolerated and there have been no significant radiation complications	
0	354	On the cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiation therapy for skull base chordoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary treatment costs and costs for recurrent tumors are estimated. The costs for treatment of recurrent tumors were estimated using a sample of 10 patients presenting with recurrent chordoma at the base of skull at DKFZ. Using various scenarios for the local control rate and reimbursements of Carbon ion therapy the cost-effectiveness of ion therapy for these tumors is analyzed. RESULTS: If local control rate for skull base chordoma achieved with carbon ion therapy exceeds 70.3%, the overall treatment costs for carbon RT are lower than for conventional RTI. The cost-effectiveness ratio for carbon RT is 2539 Euro per 1% increase in survival, or 7692 Euro per additional life year. CONCLUSION: Current results support the thesis that Carbon ion RT, although more expensive, is at least as cost-effective as advanced photon therapies for these patients. Ion RT, however, offers substantial benefits for the patients such as improved control rates and less severe side effects. [References: 18]	
0	595	Peripheral doses from pediatric IMRT	Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Breast, Child, Child,Preschool, Head, Humans, Particle Accelerators, Phantoms,Imaging, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiation Protection, Radiometry/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted, Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Risk, Skull Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Time	Peripheral dose (PD) data exist for conventional fields (> or = 10 cm) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery to standard adult-sized phantoms. Pediatric peripheral dose reports are limited to conventional therapy and are model based. Our goal was to ascertain whether data acquired from full phantom studies and/or pediatric models, with IMRT treatment times, could predict Organ at Risk (OAR) dose for pediatric IMRT. As monitor units (MUs) are greater for IMRT, it is expected IMRT PD will be higher; potentially compounded by decreased patient size (absorption). Baseline slab phantom peripheral dose measurements were conducted for very small field sizes (from 2 to 10 cm). Data were collected at distances ranging from 5 to 72 cm away from the field edges. Collimation was either with the collimating jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC) oriented either perpendicular or along the peripheral dose measurement plane. For the clinical tests, five patients with intracranial or base of skull lesions were chosen. IMRT and conventional three-dimensional (3D) plans for the same patient/target/dose (180 cGy), were optimized without limitation to the number of fields or wedge use. Six MV, 120-leaf MLC Varian axial beams were used. A phantom mimicking a 3-year-old was configured per Center for Disease Control data. Micro (0.125 cc) and cylindrical (0.6 cc) ionization chambers were appropriated for the thyroid, breast, ovaries, and testes. The PD was recorded by electrometers set to the 10(-10) scale. Each system set was uniquely calibrated. For the slab phantom studies, close peripheral points were found to have a higher dose for low energy and larger field size and when MLC was not deployed. For points more distant from the field edge, the PD was higher for high-energy beams. MLC orientation was found to be inconsequential for the small fields tested. The thyroid dose was lower for IMRT delivery than that predicted for conventional (ratio of IMRT/conventional ranged from 0.47-0.94) doses approximately [0.4-1.8 cGy]/[0.9-2.9 cGy]/fraction, respectively. Prior phantom reports are for fields 10 cm or greater, while pediatric central nervous system fields range from 4 to 7 cm, and effectively much smaller for IMRT (2-6 cm). Peripheral dose in close proximity (< 10 cm from the field edge) is dominated by internal scatter; therefore, field-size differences overwhelm phantom size affects and increased MU. Distant peripheral dose, dominated by head leakage, was higher than predicted, even when accounting for MUs (approximtely factor of 3) likely due to the pediatric phantom size. The ratio of the testes dose ranged from 3.3-5.3 for IMRT/conventional. PD to OAR for pediatric IMRT cannot be predicted from large-field full phantom studies. For regional OAR, doses are likely lower than predicted by existing "large field" data, while the distant PD is higher

This study analyzes relapse and survival in a community-based population with L-SCLC according to age and comorbidity. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 174 patients with L-SCLC referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre, between January 1991 and December 1999. Patient and treatment characteristics, disease response, relapse, and survival were compared among three age cohorts: <65 years (n = 55, 32%), 65-74 years (n = 76, 44%), and > or =75 years (n = 43, 25%); and according to Charlson comorbidity scores 0, 1, and > or =2. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with treatment response and survival. RESULTS: Patient factors that significantly differed with age were functional status classified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and number of comorbidities. Increasing age was significantly associated with fewer diagnostic scans. Combined modality chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was given in 86%, 66%, and 40% of patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively, (p <0.0001). Thoracic irradiation use was comparable among the age cohorts (p >0.05), but chemotherapy use varied significantly with less intensive regimens, fewer cycles, and lower total doses with advancing age (p <0.05). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was used in 41 patients, only 3 of whom were age >70 years. Overall response rates to primary treatment significantly decreased with advancing age: 91%, 79%, and 74% in patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively (p = 0.014). Treatment toxicity and relapse patterns were similar across the age cohorts. Overall 2-year survival rates were significantly lower with advancing age: 37%, 22%, and 19% (p = 0.003), with corresponding median survivals of 17, 12, and 7 months among patients ages <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age and Charlson comorbidity scores were not significantly associated with treatment response and survival. Independent prognostic factors favorably associated with survival were good performance status, normal lactate dehydrogenase, absence of pleural effusion, and > or =four cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity. Older patients with L-SCLC were less likely to be treated with CRT, intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Treatment response and survival rates were lower with advancing age, but this may be attributed to poor performance status and suboptimal treatment rather than age. [References: 31]

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on a group of 18 patients with cancer of the head and neck, lung, and pelvis who were treated with irregularly shaped fields. The BEV dosimetry of the fields shaped with cerrobend blocks and the MLC was measured with films at the depth of dose prescription in a solid water phantom. A "one-half-leaf" insertion convention was used to shape the MLC. In addition, an average of 15 sequential daily port films was taken per patient during the course of radiotherapy. The port films were aligned with the prescription film for each patient. Systematic error and random error of treatment setup for each patient were calculated. The effects of setup variation were incorporated by convolving the patient portal imaging data with the corresponding BEV film dosimetry. Two parameters were used to quantify the BEV dosimetry. First, the field penumbra width was calculated, which represented the average of the normal separations between 20 and 80% isodose lines along the prescription outline. Second, the ratio of areas covered by the 90 and 20% isodose lines, A90/20, was determined. The BEV dosimetry was then characterized with and without the effects of treatment setup variation. In addition, the difference in BEV dosimetry between the cerrobend block and the MLC was used to estimate the corresponding changes in tumor control probability (TCP). These changes were also compared to the changes in TCP for the treatment with or without the effects of random setup variation. RESULTS: With or without daily setup variation, the use of cerrobend block was more favorable than the MLC in terms of the field penumbra width and A90/20 for all treatment sites. In the absence of daily variation, the MLC field penumbra width was on average 1.3 mm larger than that of the cerrobend block, and 0.9 mm larger in the presence of daily setup variation. Similarly, the ratio A90/20 of the cerrobend block was on average 0.03 larger than that of MLC without daily setup variation, and 0.02 with daily setup variation. The difference in field penumbra width and A90/20 between the MLC and the cerrobend block was slightly reduced due to the effects of daily setup variation. For both the cerrobend block and the MLC, daily setup variation produced a significant increase in the field penumbra width, 2.3 mm for the cerrobend block and 1.9 mm for the MLC, and a decrease in the A90/20, 0.06 for the former and 0.05 for the latter. The change due to the daily setup variation was about a factor of 2 larger than the changes due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. Using the TCP model, the change in TCP due to the daily setup variation was more than a factor of 3 larger than the change in TCP due to replacing the cerrobend block with the MLC. It was noted that the average changes in the penumbra, the A90/20 and the TCP calculated for the patient population did not adequately describe the changes for the individual patient. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show significant dosimetric differences between the MLC and the cerrobend block in conventional radiation treatment, whether or not daily setup variation was taken into consideration. The effects of daily setup variation alone produced a larger dosimetric change. The same results were obtained when the data were applied to calculate changes in TCP. For optimal radiation therapy, efforts should be concentrated on reducing daily setup variation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of frequent evaluation of MLC treatment using electronic portal imaging devices

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer

In this survey, all the patient series treated worldwide were reviewed. They show an overall control rate of 31% with photon vs 64% with neutron therapy. A prospective randomised trial sponsored by the RTOG and the MRC published in 1988 and reviewed in 1993 showed an overall locoregional complete tumor clearance of 67% for neutrons and 17% for photons (P < 0.005), with 68% and 25% survival at two years for neutrons and photons respectively. This study was closed for ethical reasons. In Orleans, since 1987, 59 patients have been treated. At five years the persistent local control probability was 69.5%, the five-year crude survival probability 66% and the five-year tumor free survival probability was 64.5%. This review provides evidence that surgical treatment for salivary gland tumors should be limited to patients presenting a high likelihood of negative surgical margin and a small risk of facial nerve damage. Others patients should receive neutron radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment. [References: 61]

Analysis of early and late side effects and complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, early and late complications were assessed in 50 patients as a function of hypoxyradiotherapeutic dose increase. The preliminary treatment results of this radiotherapeutic modification were evaluated after a median follow-up of 48 months using Kaplen-Meier analysis. Between April 1991 and February 1997, 50 patients (36 men and 14 women) with colorectal carcinoma were treated preoperatively with locoregional accelerated hypofractionated hypoxyradiotherapy. The extent of disease was classified according to Dukes' criteria (A: four patients, B. 28 patients, C: 18 patients). We used a 20-MeV linear accelerator with two parallel opposed fields. Hypoxyradiotherapy was performed extending from the perineum to the L4 region. Acute hypoxia was induced during irradiation by ventilation of a hypoxic gas mixture containing 7.8-8.0% oxygen. Total doses of 24 Gy/8 days, 28 Gy/9 days, and 32 Gy/10 days were applied in five, 20, and 25 patients, respectively. Low anterior resection or abdominoperineal amputation of the rectum was performed the day after completion of preoperative hypoxyradiotherapy. The early reactions after irradiation were evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute (CTC-NCI). RESULTS: Early postirradiation proctitis was documented in three and early radiation-induced cystitis in two patients only. Neither early nor late radiation-associated complications were observed in any of the three hypoxyradiotherapy schedules during the follow-up period of 6-105 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (median 48 months), a 5-year overall survival rate of 61.5% and a local relapse-free survival rate of 84.2% can be expected. Treatment failures were predominantly systemic. CONCLUSION: We believe it can be concluded that acute hypoxia has a radioprotective effect on normal tissues during accelerated hypoxyradiotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. Hypoxyradiotherapy permits safe administration of doses higher than those tolerated by normoxic, noncanceorus tissue, resulting in the amplification of the biological effect of radiation on tumor tissue and contributing to an improved outcome after combined radiosurgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma

In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation

METHODS: 30 enucleated eyes were included for histopathological study and Ki-67 immunostaining. Patients were enucleated between 1991 and 1996 for uveal melanoma, 14 after proton beam irradiation and 16 without treatment (control group). The mean follow up period was 2.5 years after diagnosis and 1 year after enucleation. RESULTS: A significant relation was found between Ki-67 score and mitotic index (r = 0.56, p = 0.001), histological largest tumour diameter (r = 0.38, p = 0. 03), fibrosis (r = -0.35, p = 0.05), absence of tumoral pigmentation (p = 0.05), and presence of vascular thrombosis (p = 0.03). The Ki-67 score was significantly higher in the non-irradiated group (p = 0.01) and in the group of patients whose cause of enucleation was tumoral evolution (p = 0.005) compared with the group of patients enucleated after neovascular glaucoma. The Ki-67 score was very high in a case of orbital recurrence of uveal melanoma and metastatic death. 70% of metastasised tumours showed a Ki-67 score higher than the median value. CONCLUSION: Ki-67 labelling is a reliable method of estimating the proliferative activity in uveal melanomas after proton beam irradiation. The Ki-67 score is significantly correlated with prognostic variables (mitotic index and histological largest tumour diameter), and with radiation effects after proton beam irradiation

The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury

A 52-year-old man with stage II HCC was enrolled in the clinical study for carbon ion therapy. A total dose of 52.5 GyE in 8 fractions was delivered through a right lateral port for 13 days. Dynamic CT performed 7 months after the initiation of carbon ion therapy showed a decrease in the size of the tumor. Dynamic CT performed 12 months after the therapy revealed marginal recurrence of HCC accompanied with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Proton therapy of 66 GyE in 22 fractions was delivered through posterior and right lateral ports for 33 days. Dynamic CT performed 3 months after the initiation of proton therapy showed a regression of the recurrent tumor and disappearance of the PVTT. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after these two treatments. He was free from further recurrence 27 months after the initiation of the first carbon ion therapy. Both carbon ions and protons were effective with minimal side effects

To take advantage of this effect, techniques have been developed that combine existing hyperthermia devices with a linear accelerator. This allows concomitant delivery of either ultrasound or microwave hyperthermia with photon radiation therapy. Two techniques have been used clinically: the orthogonal technique, in which the microwave or ultrasound beam and the radiation beam are orthogonal to one another, and the en face technique, in which the ultrasound or microwave beam and the radiation beam travel into the tumour through the same treatment window. The en face technique has necessitated the development of special attachments so that the hyperthermia device can be mounted to the linear accelerator and so that non-uniform portions of the hyperthermia device can be removed from the radiation beam. For microwave therapy, applicators are mounted onto the linear accelerator using the compensating filter tray holder. For ultrasound, special reflector devices are mounted to a frame that is mounted onto the compensating filter tray holder of the linear accelerator. Because the linear accelerator is an isocentric device, the height of the radiation source is fixed, and this has necessitated specially designed devices so that the ultrasound support system is compatible with the linear accelerator. The treatment setups for both the en face technique and the orthogonal technique require the interaction of both hyperthermia and radiation therapy personnel and equipment. The dosimetry and day-to-day operations for each technique are unique. The simulation for the en face technique is much different from the simulation of a normal radiation treatment and requires the presence of a hyperthermia physicist. Also, for the en face technique, the attenuation of the microwave applicator and the thickness and attenuation of the ultrasound reflector system are taken into account for radiation dosimetry. This paper presents details of the dosimetry and logistics of the techniques for simultaneous thermoradiotherapy based on 7 years of experience treating more than 50 patients	
0	391	Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units	Dose Fractionation, Humans, Massachusetts, Models,Statistical, Motion, Movement, Particle Accelerators, Probability, Radiation Oncology, Radiometry, Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Radiotherapy Planning,Computer-Assisted/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy,Intensity-Modulated/mt [Methods], Radiotherapy/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy/mt [Methods], Research, Supine Position	Interplay between organ (breathing) motion and leaf motion has been shown in the literature to have a small dosimetric impact for clinical conditions (over a 30 fraction treatment). However, previous studies did not consider the case of treatment beams made up of many few-monitor-unit (MU) segments, where the segment delivery time (1-2 s) is of the order of the breathing period (3-5 s). In this study we assess if breathing compromises the radiotherapy treatment with IMRT segments of low number of MUs. We assess (i) how delivered dose varies, from patient to patient, with the number of MU per segment, (ii) if this delivered dose is identical to the average dose calculated without motion over the path of the motion, and (iii) the impact of the daily variation of the delivered dose as a function of MU per segment. The organ motion was studied along two orthogonal directions, representing the left-right and cranial-caudal directions of organ movement for a patient setup in the supine position. Breathing motion was modeled as sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x), based on functions used in the literature to represent organ motion. Measurements were performed with an ionization chamber and films. For a systematic study of motion effects, a MATLAB simulation was written to model organ movement and dose delivery. In the case of a single beam made up of one single segment, the dose delivered to point in a moving target over 30 fractions can vary up to 20% and 10% for segments of 10 MU and 20 MU, respectively. This dose error occurs because the tumor spends most of the time near the edges of the radiation beam. In the case of a single beam made of multiple segments with low MU, we observed 2.4%, 3.3%, and 4.3% differences, respectively, for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion, between delivered dose and motion-averaged dose for points in the penumbra region of the beam and over 30 fractions. In approximately 5-10% of the cases, differences between the motion-averaged dose and the delivered 30-fraction dose could reach 6%, 8% and 10-12%, respectively for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion. To analyze a clinical IMRT beam, two patient plans were randomly selected. For one of the patients, the beams showed a likelihood of up to 25.6% that the delivered dose would deviate from the motion-averaged dose by more than 1%. For the second patient, there was a likelihood of up to 62.8% of delivering a dose that differs by more than 1% from the motion-averaged dose and a likelihood of up to approximately 30% for a 2% dose error. For the entire five-beam IMRT plan, statistical averaging over the beams reduces the overall dose error between the delivered dose and the motion-averaged dose. For both patients there was a likelihood of up to 7.0% and 33.9% that the dose error was greater than 1%, respectively. For one of the patients, there was a 12.6% likelihood of a 2% dose error. Daily intrafraction variation of the delivered dose of more than 10% is non-negligible and can potentially lead to biological effects. We observed [for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x)] that below 10-15 MU leads to large daily variations of the order of 15-35%. Therefore, for small MU segments, non-negligible biological effects can be incurred. We conclude that for most clinical cases the effects may be small because of the use of many beams, it is desirable to avoid low-MU segments when treating moving targets. In addition, dose averaging may not work well for hypo-fractionation, where fewer fractions are used. For hypo-fractionation, PDF modeling of the tumor motion in IMRT optimization may not be adequate

Thirty-three patients developed metastasis (6.5%) from 3 to 51 months following treatment. The primary site of metastasis was the liver in 28 cases (85%). Both demographic and clinical factors were considered. The three leading predictors of survival without metastasis after proton beam irradiation in order of importance were: (1) largest diameter of the tumor; (2) location of the anterior margin of the tumor; and (3) age at treatment. Worse prognosis was associated with largest tumor diameter greater than 15.0 mm, tumor involvement of the ciliary body and age at treatment older than 59 years

After treatment by heavy ion beam therapy, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was pT3, pN0, pM0, stage IIA. Sixteen months after the surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he was vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging caused by failure of the cut end of the gastroduodenal artery into the elevated jejunum was confirmed by angiogram, and the hemorrhaging could be stopped by a transcatheter arterial embolization operation. Twenty-four months after surgery, the patient was readmitted because he was once again vomiting blood. Hemorrhaging from the elevated jejunum was suspected by hemorrhagic scintigram, but the source could not be identified on further examination, and the choice of treatment was difficult. The patient died on the 9th day after admittance to the hospital. Even on examination at autopsy, the source of the hemorrhaging could not be identified. No recurrence of cancer could be found. This has proven to be a perplexing case, in that hemorrhaging from the end of the routinely cut gastroduodenal artery occurred 16 and 24 months after heavy ion beam therapy and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities

A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 2001, AFR was used to treat 36 patients with advanced stage primary (n=33) or recurrent (n=3) nasal or paranasal malignant tumors. Full ophthalmologic follow-up was documented. The median dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 69.6 CGE (range 60.8-77). Visual complications were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and the late effects of normal tissue (LENT) scoring systems. The median follow-up was 52.4 months (range 17-122.8). RESULTS: Thirteen patients developed late visual/ocular toxicity. Cataracts were LENT grade 1 and 3 in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One LENT grade 1 vascular retinopathy and 1 optic neuropathy were also observed. Three and five patients presented with nasolacrimal duct stenosis (CTC grade 2, 2 patients; CTC grade 3, 1 patient) and dry-eye syndrome (CTC grade 1, 1 patient; CTC grade 2, 4 patients), respectively. The 3- and 5-year probability of LENT/CTC grade > or =2 visual toxicity were 15.8+/-6.7% and 20.7+/-7.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AFR for locally advanced nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors enables delivery of 70 CGE to the tumor with acceptable ophthalmologic complications	
1	685	Radiation necrosis versus glioma recurrence: conventional MR imaging clues to diagnosis	Aged, Biopsy, Brain Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis], Brain Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Brain/pa [Pathology], Corpus Callosum/pa [Pathology], Diagnosis,Differential, Female, Glioma/di [Diagnosis], Glioma/rt [Radiotherapy], Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Middle Aged, Necrosis, Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/di [Diagnosis], Radiation, Radiation Injuries/di [Diagnosis], Recurrence	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging findings are considered to be inadequate for reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with glioma. Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHODS: MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a "spreading wavefront" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy

Direct particle beam traversal of at least a portion of the lens usually is unavoidable in treatment of posterior intraocular tumors. The precise treatment planned for each patient permits quantitative assessment of the lenticular dose and its radiation quality. We are reporting our preliminary results on the development of helium-ion-induced lens opacifications and cataracts in 54 of these patients who had 10% or less of their lens in the treatment field. We believe these studies will be relevant to estimating the human risk for cataract in space flight	
0	2721	Dosimetric results from a feasibility study of a novel radiosurgical source for irradiation of intracranial metastases	Adult, Aged, Aged,80 and over, Biopsy, Boston, Brain, Brain Neoplasms/sc [Secondary], Brain Neoplasms/su [Surgery], Electric Power Supplies, Equipment Design, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Massachusetts, Methods, Middle Aged, Morbidity, Prognosis, Protons, Radiation, Radiation Oncology, Radiosurgery, Radiosurgery/is [Instrumentation], Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy Dosage, Research, Self Care, Survival, Time, X-Rays	PURPOSE: A feasibility study addressing the role of a new miniature x-ray device, the Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS), for interstitial radiosurgical treatment of intracranial metastatic neoplasms, was conducted at our institution. To gain insight into the role of PRS vis-a-vis other currently available radiosurgical treatment modalities, dosimetric comparisons of Linac Radiosurgery and proton beam therapy were performed in the treatment of a small approximately spherical metastasis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The photon radiosurgery system is a miniature, battery operated, high-voltage x-ray generator that produces low-energy x-rays with an effective energy of 10-20 keV emanating from the tip of a probe stereotactically inserted into small tumors (< 3 cm in diameter) in humans. Patients, 18 years or older, with supratentorial mass lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible if they were likely to survive their systemic cancer and be capable of self-care for more than 4 months. Patients were ineligible if presenting with infratentorial lesions, contraindications for biopsy, or receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks were ineligible. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with metastatic supratentorial lesions were treated from December 1992 to December 1993 for metastatic tumors to the brain. Single doses of 10-20 Gy were delivered to spherical targets of 10 to 35 mm in diameter. Treatment, including biopsy, pathologic review and radiation treatment, generally took less than 3 h. One patient, later found to have an ischemic stroke, developed a small hemorrhage from the biopsy that preceded interstitial irradiation. There were no other complications. Median survival was 10 months. Three locally recurrent lesions failed at 3.5, 4, and 10 months after treatment. All patients had stable or improved Karnofsky status for 2 weeks to 21 months after treatment. The PRS dosimetry appears at least as good as that obtained using 6 MV Linac or 160 MeV protons. Analyses of dose-volume histograms comparing the volumes of normal CNS tissue irradiated employing each of the respective modalities suggest a small sparing of normal tissue with PRS, as opposed to linac or protons, in this patient population with small, approximately spherical tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The PRS device provides a unique cost and time efficient procedure for providing interstitial radiation therapy immediately following histologic confirmation of malignancy in patients undergoing biopsy of intracranial lesions. The PRS treatment appears safe, and preliminary data suggest no evidence of treatment-related morbidity within the life span of the selected patient population. When treating small, spherical lesions, PRS appears to offer a modest dosimetric advantage over Linac or proton beam therapy in sparing normal tissue. These encouraging results have prompted a Phase II trial that is currently underway. Further efforts are necessary in the design of a clinically relevant trial addressing the role of fractionated external beam radiation therapy with boost vs. PRS treatment with WBRT in the treatment of single metastases

A slight but significant difference was noted between the two T categories. Fifty-three patients who were tumour-free 3 to 4 months after irradiation had a 55 per cent survival. No other prognostic parameters were identified on the basis of histologic or radiologic findings. In 14 patients severe radiation complications were observed (bladder 9, small bowel 3, combined 2). In patients with radiation sensitive bladder carcinoma, radical radiation therapy seems to be a comparable alternative to total cystectomy

The pathological findings and clinical course of KBS with recurrent stroke-like episodes and partial epilepsy within a 7-year period following a 'safe dose' radiation therapy for pituitary tumor are presented. Serial magnetic resonance imaging shows, at different stages of the disease, a pontine infarct, enlarged temporal lobes with serpentine hyperintense signal at cortical gyri on T2-weighted and proton density MRI, and progressive brain calcification which appears hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 133 unselected patients with histologically proven SCLC who were treated from 1985-1990 in our department. From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies

The optimum time to use this modality for palliation of symptoms is unclear. Our department treated 44 evaluable patients with upper and lower halfbody radiation. Stratification according to a modified Karnofsky performance scale revealed an 86% response with a notable increase in median duration of survival in those patients exhibiting an initial performance scale of -1. The optimum benefit from halfbody irradiation is derived when administered at the earliest indicated time

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue

They received total doses of 51-99.2 Gy in fractions of 2-12.5 Gy. All of the tumours responded well to the treatment. All four lesions of Bowen's disease, three of the five oral verrucous carcinomas, and the three squamous cell carcinomas completely regressed following irradiation. Two squamous cell carcinomas recurred during the follow-up period. One recurrent squamous cell carcinoma was successfully treated by a salvage surgical operation, and in the other case the patient refused further therapy. In two verrucous carcinomas there was 90% regression of tumour volume. No severe radiation-related complication occurred. As proton radiotherapy produces good local tumour control without significant morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues, it may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the treatment of skin carcinomas

Eighty-five brain metastases in 81 patients were investigated before treatment and 16-18h thereafter. Standard metabolic ratios, namely N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), phosphorylcholine/glycerophosphorylcholine (Cho)/Cr, NAA/Cho, lactate (Lac)/Cr, and mobile lipids (Lip)/Cr, were calculated, and comparison of their values before and after irradiation was done. No volumetric changes of any neoplasm were found in any case on the next day after treatment. At the same time, significant reduction of Cho/Cr (P < 0.001) and NAA/Cr (P < 0.01) ratios on the proton MRS of the tumor was disclosed. Reduction of Cho/Cr ratio was significantly more prominent in neoplasms with higher pretreatment Cho/Cr ratios (P < 0.001) and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (P < 0.01). Reduction of NAA/Cr ratio was predominantly determined by its pretreatment value (P < 0.001). The observed decrease of Cho/Cr ratio probably reflects inhibition of proliferative activity and early apoptotic cell loss, whereas reduction of NAA/Cr may result from radiation-induced modulation of neuronal activity in the peritumoral brain tissue. Serial proton MRS represents a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of metabolic changes in intracranial neoplasms after radiosurgical treatment

A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation.

METHODS: Sixteen patients, aged 7-34 years, were treated with proton-beam radiation. All had undergone at least one tumor resection. Seven patients underwent repeat resection for recurrence; one had previous x-ray radiotherapy. A daily dose of 1.8 cobalt gray equivalent was used to give a total dose in the range of 50.4-59.4 cobalt gray equivalent. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. Twelve of 15 patients survived. There were few acute side effects. Long-term complications included newly diagnosed panhypopituitarism, a cerebrovascular accident from which the patient fully recovered, and an out-of-proton-field meningioma in the single patient who received previous radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Fractionated proton radiotherapy is an effective treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late complications

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84% and 77%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS

Twenty-five were in stage I (32.1%) and 35 in stage II (67.9%). All patients were submitted to staging laparotomy. Cases with large mediastinal mass were excluded from this series. Delivered doses were 44 Gy in involved areas, 40 Gy on the mediastinum and 36 Gy on uninvolved sites. Twenty-four patients in stage I (96%) and 33 in stage II (94.2%) obtained complete remission. Actuarial 10- and 20-yr overall (OS) rates were 86% and 79.1%, respectively. Event-free (EFS) and relapse-free (RFS) survival rates at 10 and 20 yr were 67.5% and 62.1%, respectively. The occurrence of disease relapse resulted in the only statistical significant prognostic factor for OS in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Distant and extranodal recurrences were significantly (P<0.01) related to a reduced OS. On multivariate analysis stage was the only determinant factor for increased RFS. Extended field RT proved to be an effective curative modality for stage I HD patients, whereas 15 out of 33 patients in stage II relapsed requiring salvage therapy. Long-term analysis of survival and treatment-related morbidity rates will improve our knowledge and assist the physicians to choose the therapeutic option to offer to HD patients

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HCC for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy. Four patients had renal failure, 2 patients had severe heart disease, 9 patients had severe cirrhosis, 1 patient had aplastic anemia, 1 patient had a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm before treatment, and 4 patients had bleeding tendency or unresectable tumors. Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to iodine, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Hepatic tumors were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the tumors ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm). No patient had regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for tumor treatments. RESULTS: All but 1 of the irradiated tumors were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years. Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant metastases in the lungs. Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and all recurrent tumors were controlled. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively. Grade > or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with HCC. The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with HCC who had limited treatment options. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society	
1	1227	Proton beam therapy with high-dose irradiation for superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas	Aged, Aged,80 and over, Carcinoma/mo [Mortality], Carcinoma/rt [Radiotherapy], Dose-Response Relationship,Radiation, Esophageal Neoplasms/mo [Mortality], Esophageal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy], Female, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Protons, Radiation, Recurrence, Research, Survival, Survival Rate, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome	PURPOSE: With the aim of improving the results of treatment for esophageal carcinoma, we have investigated the efficacy and toxicity associated with the use of a 250-MeV proton beam for radical radiation therapy in esophageal carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, n = 13; advanced, n = 17) had been treated with proton beam therapy alone or with photon therapy followed by proton beam therapy. In combination therapy with photon and proton beams, one fraction dose was 1.8-2.0 Gy for photon and 2.5-3.7 Gy (mean, 3.1 Gy) for proton beam. In proton beam therapy alone, one fraction dose was 3.1-3.6 Gy (mean, 3.2 Gy). Overall mean total doses of the irradiation were 77.7 Gy in superficial carcinoma and 80.7 Gy in advanced carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: Mean overall actuarial survival in patients with superficial and advanced carcinomas was 60.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. The local recurrence and disease- specific survival rates for patients with superficial carcinoma were 0 and 100% at 5 years, and 0 and 87.5% at 10 years, respectively; the same rates for the patients with advanced carcinoma were 56.6 and 49.0% at 5 years, 78.3 and 38.1% at 10 years, respectively. Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer without injury of adjacent organs occurred in 20 (66.7%) of 30 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Better local control and 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were achieved by a higher dose of irradiation with well-defined proton fields in superficial and advanced esophageal carcinomas

METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with peripheral arterial disease, who were treated with "bail-out" stent implantation in the superficial femoral artery due to suboptimal PTA, were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving either external beam irradiation (6 MV photons, total dose 24 Gy in a hypofractionated schedule) plus antiplatelet therapy (EBI group) or antiplatelet therapy alone (control group). RESULTS: No procedure-related complications occurred, and all patients of the EBI group received the full dose of 24 Gy. During the long-term follow-up, an overall statistically significant difference was demonstrated in favor of the EBI group patients, regarding both the in-stent (log-rank test, p = 0.0072) and the in-segment binary restenosis (log-rank test, p = 0.0103). The primary patency rates were also significantly better in the EBI group at specific time-points, such as in the first (74.2% vs 46.5%, p = 0.019), second (62.5% vs 33.8%, p = 0.020), and third (54.6% vs 29.0%, p = 0.039) year, respectively. Moreover, the overall clinically driven reintervention rate was significantly lower among patients of the irradiated group (log-rank test, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Our long-term follow-up analysis revealed that EBI following femoral artery PTA and stenting significantly reduces restenosis and reintervention rates, while improving primary patency

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, children requiring sedation can be admitted for proton therapy at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Children under 5 years of age with RMS of the head and the trunk were analyzed. All children were enrolled in a multidisciplinary treatment protocol and prospective, standardized evaluation of side effects was performed. RESULTS: Nine children were included aged 0.9-3.8 years (embryonal RMS in six, and alveolar, undifferentiated or nonclassified in one each). The tumor site was parameningeal (n = 4), orbital (n = 3), head and neck (n = 1), and prostate (n = 1). All children were in IRS group III. Total proton dose was 46-54 CGE (cobalt-gray equivalent). Only the myelotoxicity exceeded grade 3 or 4 (RTOG/EORTC). CONCLUSION: Proton therapy for RMS in early children is feasible and well tolerated. The prospective standardized evaluation of toxicity and quality of life needs to be continued

We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients. Randomized trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RIT in the context of stem cell transplantation have been initiated and the results are keenly anticipated. [References: 38]

We presented performed 1H-MRS using the stimulated echo acquisition method (STEAM) for non-tumor sites in 2 patients who received radiation therapy for their brain tumors. In the first case up to 45 days after radiation, we could observe a normal spectra presented three major peaks of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline (Cho). In the second case who had radiation necrosis 1 year after radiation, the spectra showed a decrease in the all peaks beneath the noise level

Because lupus erythematosus tumidus (LET) has rarely been documented in the literature and is often difficult to differentiate from other photodermatoses such as polymorphous light eruption, we performed photoprovocation tests in 60 patients with LET according to a standardized protocol. Areas of uninvolved skin on the upper back were irradiated with single doses of UV-A (100 J/cm2) and/or UV-B (1.5 minimal erythema dose) daily for three consecutive days. Interestingly, patients with LET are more photosensitive than those with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and in our study experimental phototesting revealed characteristic skin lesions in 43 patients (72%). Because of the latency period in developing positive phototest reactions, it might be difficult for these patients to link sun exposure with their skin lesions. Furthermore, our data revealed a positive correlation of antinuclear antibodies and positive provocative phototest reactions in these patients as seen for other forms of LE. In conclusion, the high incidence of positive phototest reactions in correlation with the clinical findings, history of photosensitivity and antinuclear antibodies enable the classification of LET as the most photosensitive type of LE
